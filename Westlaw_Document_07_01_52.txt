Bayer Schering Pharma AG (“Bayer”) appeals 
the judgment of the United States District Court for 
the District of New Jersey, holding U.S. Patent No. 
6,787,531 (“'531 Patent ”) invalid due to obviousness. 
Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Barr Labs., 
Inc., No. 05-CV-2308, 2008 WL 628592 (D.N.J. 
March 3, 2008). Because we hold that the invention 
would have been obvious to try, we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

Bayer is a large pharmaceutical company that 
produces the daily oral contraceptive, Yasmin®. 
One of the active ingredients in Yasmin, drospirenone, 
is a progestin that inhibits ovulation. Each of 
the invalidated claims requires drospirenone as the 
active ingredient. Drospirenone was known in the 
art at all times relevant. Its contraceptive qualities 
are particularly well suited for producing an oral 
contraceptive because, in addition to inhibiting 
ovulation, it is a diuretic which will diminish excess 
water retention arising from the estrogen component 
of oral contraceptives, and has anti-acne 
qualities to promote clear skin. These desirable 
qualities have led to Yasmin's success. Drospirenone 
is also acid-sensitive. When exposed to low-pH 
(highly acidic) environments such as found in the 
human stomach, drospirenone “isomerizes”-that is, 
the acid catalyzes a reaction that rearranges drospirenone's 
molecular structure while its molecular 
composition remains constant. The resulting isomer 
is non-antimineralocorticoidal, meaning it will not 
act as a diuretic, removing the desirable anti-
bloating effect that sets drospirenone apart from 
other prior art progestins. Therefore, scientists 
working with drospirenone for use in an oral contraceptive 
must be aware of and work around the 
effects that the human stomach will have on the 
drug to ensure that its “bioavailability”-the amount 
of the active drug absorbed into the bloodstream 
and available to act on the body-is high enough to 
perform its contraceptive function. 

Drospirenone is also a poorly water soluble hydrophobic 
composition. Because it will not easily 
dissolve into a volume of liquid, its bioavailability 
is degraded. To combat this, pharmaceutical producers 
commonly employ a technique called 
“micronization,” whereby the drug's particle size is 
reduced, increasing its overall surface area. Often 
(but not always) with a larger surface area, the dissolution 
rate is also increased, ensuring that all of 
the poorly water soluble drug that can dissolve 
*1344 will dissolve in a given volume of liquid. 
With more of the drug dissolved, the drug will ex

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

hibit a higher bioavailability. Indeed, Bayer's expert 
testified at trial that this would be his first choice in 
attempting to increase the dissolution rate because, 
among the different ways to increase the dissolution 
rate, micronization presents the best chance of success. 
All commercially available oral contraceptives 
use micronized progestins and/or estrogens, so 
this technique was well known in the art. 

While micronizing a poorly water soluble composition 
may result in increased bioavailability, micronizing 
an acid-sensitive composition may also 
increase its sensitivity to the acid. A drug that isomerizes 
when exposed to acid thus may isomerize 
at a faster rate if it is micronized. 

One method pharmaceutical companies use to 
surmount an acid-sensitivity problem with a drug to 
be taken orally is to deliver the drug via an entericcoated 
pill, as opposed to an immediate release pill, 
also called a “normal pill.” An enteric coating is a 
pH-sensitive film that protects the drug from stomach 
acid, and only releases the drug when it has 
passed into the less acidic duodenum and small intestine. 
However, enteric coatings are not without 
drawbacks themselves. Coated tablets including enteric 
coated tablets present an obstacle to absorption, 
and thus reduce the drug's exhibited bioavailability. 
Additionally, as was known in the art at the 
time, they introduce a significant delay in the onset 
of therapeutic response while creating a considerable 
patient-to-patient variation of that onset. In 
fact, even for an individual taking the drug at different 
times, the response time may vary considerably 
from dose to dose. Bayer scientists noticed 
these intra-and inter-individual bioavailability differences 
in practice in their studies on beagles and 
women. This presented a further complication because 
Bayer required the drug to be 99% effective, 
and work on all women at a single dose-“one dose 
must fit all.” A normal pill may not present such 
variations, but will expose its contents to the stomach's 
highly acidic environment. 

Dr. Johannes Tack, a Bayer scientist, began 
work in 1983 to develop drospirenone into an oral 

contraceptive. At the time, Bayer had been working 
with a related compound, spirorenone, as a diuretic. 
When consumed, spirorenone metabolizes into 
drospirenone, which is still a diuretic, but was 
found to have progestogenic (contraceptive) effects. 
Spirorenone itself had some contraceptive effects 
that Bayer concluded were the result of the appearance 
of drospirenone when it metabolized. Bayer 
decided to harness the diuretic effect of isolated 
drospirenone to create the new contraceptive. Tack 
consulted prior Bayer work with drospirenone including 
in vitro isomerization studies performed by 
a fellow Bayer scientist, Dr. Werner Krause. 
Krause had also performed in vivo studies with 
spirorenone, about which he published three articles. 
These studies, Krause I, II, and III, included 
the knowledge that drospirenone was a metabolite 
of spirorenone. Tack decided, however, that these 
in vivo studies garnered little information on the 
practice of drospirenone in vivo. 

Tack tested the stability of drospirenone in acid 
at pH 1 to simulate the conditions of the stomach. 
He found that after 10 minutes, 21% of the drospirenone 
had isomerized in the acid, and after 45 
minutes, half had isomerized. He came to a critical 
conclusion: 

If the results obtained in vitro are applied to in 
vivo conditions, it can be presumed that, with an 
assumed gastric *1345 juice volume of 100ml, 
the majority of the dose (solubility of drospirenone 
5-10 mg/l) passes into solution during passage 
through the stomach and consequently undergoes 
rapid isomerization. A clear reduction in 
the bioavailability of the unchanged active substance 
is to be expected as a result. 

The planned studies on the progestogenic efficacy 
of [drospirenone] should therefore be performed 
with an enteric-coated formulation. 

Tack then moved into clinical studies with an 
enteric-coated formulation of drospirenone. For 
five years, Bayer used this coated pill in its studies, 
even reconfirming in 1988 that drospirenone

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

needed an enteric coating because it isomerized 
quickly in a pH 1 acidic solution. 

In 1988, Bayer also planned a study to determine 
how effectively its enteric-coated tablet delivered 
a formulation as compared to an intravenous 
injection of the same formulation. This study would 
thus measure the “absolute bioavailability” of the 
drug. Bayer added what it terms a “non-routine” 
element to the study, by which it added an unprotected 
(normal) drospirenone tablet and compared 
its bioavailability to that of the enteric-coated formulation 
and the intravenous delivery. Tack expected 
to find that the enteric-coated tablet would produce 
a lower bioavailability than an intravenous injection, 
while the normal pill would produce an 
even lower bioavailability than the enteric-coated 
tablet. However, he found that despite his observations 
that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in 
a highly acidic environment and his belief therefore 
that an enteric coating would be necessary to preserve 
bioavailability, the normal pill and the enteric-
coated pill resulted in the same bioavailability. 
Following this study, Bayer developed drospirenone 
in a normal pill, for which it would eventually 
receive the '531 patent. 

Bayer relied on the finding that drospirenone 
would absorb with a normal pill to overcome an obviousness 
rejection in the Patent and Trademark Office. 
During prosecution, the examiner rejected the 
claims as obvious in view of a De Castro reference, 
which the examiner said taught to micronize poorly 
soluble drugs to increase their bioavailability. Bayer 
responded that another piece of prior art, the 
Nickisch reference, taught that micronizing drospirenone 
would increase its exposure to the highly 
acidic environment in the stomach, which would 
result in increased isomerization. The examiner allowed 
the claims, giving the specific reason that the 
prior art suggested that micronizing drospirenone 
would not work: “The micronized drospirenone will 
be degraded even more rapidly because the micronization 
of drospirenone expose [sic] the drug 
particles in the stomach (acidic). Therefore, to for


mulate an oral dosage forms [sic] containing the 
drospirenone particles, which exposed to the gastric 
environment upon dissolution, would be 
un[o]bvious in view of the data presented....” 

The '531 patent issued on September 7, 2004. 
Claim 1 is representative: 

1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising 
from about 2 mg to about 4 mg of micronized 
drospirenone particles, about 0.01 mg to about 

0.05 mg of 17.alpha.-ethinylestradiol, and one 
or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, 
the composition being in an oral dose form exposed 
to the gastric environment upon dissolution, 


*1346 and the composition being effective for 
oral contraception in a human female. 

Barr Laboratories (“Barr”) makes generic pharmaceuticals, 
and filed an Abbreviated New Drug 
Application with the Food and Drug Administration 
seeking approval to market a generic version of 
Yasmin®. Bayer promptly filed a patent infringement 
suit against Barr. The parties agreed that if the 
'531 patent is valid, Barr infringes claims 1, 5, 8, 
27, 29, 36, 49, and 50. Barr then alleged that these 
claims are obvious, among other invalidity and unenforceability 
arguments. At trial, the two parties 
agreed that 2-4 mg drospirenone was well known in 
the art, as well as its combination with 0.01-0.05 
mg 17á-ethinylestradiol, a pharmaceutically acceptable 
carrier, and a kit containing 21 such tablets 
with active ingredients and 7 placebos, to be used 
as an effective oral contraceptive in human females. 
Bayer claimed that its innovation was that the drospirenone 
could be micronized to increase its 
bioavailability, and that the micronized drospirenone 
would not need to be enteric coated for protection 
against the highly acidic gastric environment. 

The district court ruled that these claims were 
invalid as obvious, and rejected Barr's other theories. 
The court found that a person having ordinary

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

skill in the art would have considered the Krause I, 
II, and III studies' results that spirorenone though 
acid-sensitive would nevertheless absorb in vivo 
because drospirenone is closely related to spirorenone. 
It also found that while the Nickisch reference 
did teach that drospirenone isomerizes in vitro 
when exposed to acid simulating the human stomach, 
a person of ordinary skill would be aware of 
the study's shortcomings, and would verify whether 
drospirenone absorbed or isomerized with precise 
in vivo and in vitro testing as suggested by the 
Robert Aulton treatise, Pharmaceutrics: The Science 
of Dosage Form Design (1988). It then held 
that under KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 
550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 
(2007), it would have been obvious to a person having 
ordinary skill in pharmaceutical formulation to 
try a normal pill in formulating drospirenone as an 
oral contraceptive. Bayer timely appeals this ruling; 
Barr does not cross-appeal its adverse rulings. We 
have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1295(a)(1). 

DISCUSSION 

[1] Obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is the 
sole issue in this appeal. Whether an invention 
would have been obvious at the time the invention 
was made is a question of law, which we review de 
novo, based on underlying facts, which we review 
for clear error. Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm 
Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1355 
(Fed.Cir.2007). A district court's finding is clearly 
erroneous when, despite some supporting evidence, 
we are “left with the definite and firm conviction 
that a mistake has been committed.” Forest Labs., 
Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 339 F.3d 1324, 1328 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (quoting United States v. U.S. 
Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 
L.Ed. 746 (1948)). 
[2] A patent may not be obtained if the differences 
between the subject matter sought to be patented 
and the prior art are such that the subject matter 
as a whole would have been obvious at the time 
the invention was made to a person having ordinary 
skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains. 
35 U.S.C. § 103(a). *1347 An obviousness analysis 
is based on several factual inquiries. A court must 
examine the scope and content of the prior art, the 
differences between the prior art and the claims at 
issue, and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent 
art. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18, 
86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). At that point, 
a court may consider secondary objective evidence 
of non-obviousness, such as commercial success, 
long felt but unsolved need, failure of others, and 
the like. Id. 

In KSR, the Supreme Court stated that an invention 
may be found obvious if it would have been 
obvious to a person having ordinary skill to try a 
course of conduct: 

When there is a design need or market pressure to 
solve a problem and there are a finite number of 
identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary 
skill has good reason to pursue the known 
options within his or her technical grasp. If this 
leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the 
product not of innovation but of ordinary skill 
and common sense. In that instance the fact that a 
combination was obvious to try might show that 
it was obvious under § 103. 

550 U.S. at 421, 127 S.Ct. 1727. This approach 
is consistent with our methodology in In re 
O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 894 (Fed.Cir.1988). See Proctor 
& Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 566 
F.3d 989, 996-97 (Fed.Cir.2009); In re Kubin, 561 
F.3d 1351, 1359, (Fed.Cir.2009). O'Farrell observed 
that most inventions that are obvious were 
also obvious to try, but found two classes where 
that rule of thumb did not obtain. 

[3] First, an invention would not have been obvious 
to try when the inventor would have had to 
try all possibilities in a field unreduced by direction 
of the prior art. When “what would have been 
‘obvious to try’ would have been to vary all parameters 
or try each of numerous possible choices until 
one possibly arrived at a successful result, where

575 F.3d 1341, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1569 

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

the prior art gave either no indication of which 
parameters were critical or no direction as to which 
of many possible choices is likely to be successful” 
an invention would not have been obvious. 
O'Farrell, 853 F.2d at 903. This is another way to 
express the KSR prong requiring the field of search 
to be among a “finite number of identified” solutions. 
550 U.S. at 421, 127 S.Ct. 1727; see also 
Proctor & Gamble, 566 F.3d at 996; Kubin, 561 
F.3d at 1359. It is also consistent with our interpretation 
that KSR requires the number of options to be 
“small or easily traversed.” Ortho-McNeil Pharm., 
Inc. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 520 F.3d 1358, 1364 
(Fed.Cir.2008). 

[4] Second, an invention is not obvious to try 
where vague prior art does not guide an inventor toward 
a particular solution. A finding of obviousness 
would not obtain where “what was ‘obvious to try’ 
was to explore a new technology or general approach 
that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, 
where the prior art gave only general 
guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention 
or how to achieve it.” O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 
at 903. This expresses the same idea as the KSR requirement 
that the identified solutions be 
“predictable.” 550 U.S. at 421, 127 S.Ct. 1727; see 
also Proctor & Gamble, 566 F.3d at 996-97; Kubin, 
561 F.3d at 1359-60. 
[5] Because the use of drospirenone with 
17á-ethinylestradiol as an oral contraceptive was 
known prior art, Bayer represented that the innovation 
was to micronize*1348 the drospirenone to increase 
its bioavailability, and that the micronized 
drospirenone would absorb with a normal pill, 
against the teachings of the prior art. The district 
court analyzed the prior art and determined that micronizing 
drospirenone was taught, and that using a 
normal pill would have been obvious to try. 
The court first determined how the person having 
ordinary skill in the art of pharmaceutical formulation 
would consider the correlation of in vitro 
and in vivo tests. It relied principally on Robert 
Aulton's pharmacologist textbook, Pharmaceutics: 

The Science of Dosage Form Design, which, as the 
court found, teaches that “dissolution rate data 
when combined with solubility ... provide an insight 
to the formulator into the potential in vivo absorption 
characteristics of a drug. However, in vitro 
tests only have significance if they can be related to 
in vivo results. Once such a relationship has been 
established, in vitro dissolution tests can be used as 
a quality control test. (Aulton, p. 9).” The court 
concluded that the person of ordinary skill would 
not accept in vitro testing as valid without a correlation 
to in vivo tests. 

With that knowledge, the court then turned to 
micronization. It found that Aulton cut both ways 
on this point, because it taught both that micronizing 
a poorly water soluble substance like drospirenone 
may increase its absorption rate, but may also 
increase the rate of degradation. However, Aulton 
stated, and other evidence corroborated, that “it is 
now generally recognized that poorly soluble drugs 
showing a dissolution rate limiting step in the absorption 
process will be more readily bioavailable 
when administered in a finely subdivided 
[micronized] form with larger surfaces than as the 
coarse material.... The fine material often in micronized 
form with larger specific surface dissolves 
at faster rates which can lead to improved drug absorption 
by passive diffusion.” The district court 
acknowledged that the prior art suggested that there 
would be concern about the dissolution of a poorly 
water soluble acid-sensitive drug, but found that the 
prior art generally suggests that micronization 
could improve the dissolution of drospirenone. It 
concluded that a person having ordinary skill would 
have seen it as a viable option. 

Bayer argues that this is clear error because the 
court relied on one piece of prior art to show that 
micronization has been shown to work on acid-
sensitive compounds. The court reviewed the Hargrove 
reference, which was a study on micronizing 
progesterone, concluding that “it confirms that not 
all acid-sensitive drugs require enteric coating.” 
This is incorrect, as Barr agrees, because progester

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

one is not an acid-sensitive drug. However, Bayer's 
own expert, Dr. James McGinity, testified that micronization 
is the first choice solution because it 
presents the best chance for success. So there remains 
adequate support for the conclusion that micronization 
was a viable option. 

The district court then moved to Bayer's second 
alleged non-obvious aspect of the invention, whether 
the formulation should use an enteric-coated or 
normal tablet delivery. The court considered Bayer's 
argument that prior art taught formulation scientists 
to employ an enteric coating on drospirenone, 
and Barr's argument that an enteric coating is 
so complicated, expensive, cumbersome to manufacture, 
and prone to variability that it only would 
be used as a last resort by formulation scientists 
working with an acid-sensitive drug. The court 
found neither side persuasive, *1349 and considered 
the prior art as the center, again focusing on 
the Aulton textbook. It found that Aulton recognizes 
the necessity of an enteric coating to the formulation 
of acid-sensitive drugs, but that an enteric 
coating also introduces drawbacks, including that 
enteric coated tablets have the lowest bioavailability 
of all drug delivery forms. Poor bioavailability 
of drospirenone is the major problem that Tack 
sought to solve. The district court further found that 
Aulton teaches that there is variability in bioavailability 
both intra-and inter-subject when using enteric 
coated tablets, which is a significant obstacle 
to Bayer's requirement that the drug must be 99% 
effective for all women. 

In effect, while Bayer argued that prior art 
teaches away from using micronized drospirenone 
in a normal tablet, Barr argued that the prior art 
teaches away from using an enteric coating. What 
the parties have done, however, is present the options 
available to a pharmaceutical formulator having 
ordinary skill to solve the problem of acid-
sensitive but hydrophobic drospirenone. 

Barr argued that the Krause series on spirorenone 
is controlling because of the great similarity 
between spirorenone and drospirenone. The Krause 

series tested the bioavailability of spirorenone in 
vivo in humans and monkeys to determine whether 
there was need to develop a “pharmaceutical formulation 
resistant to gastric juice.” The studies 
each found no spirorenone isomers in the subjects' 
blood streams, and concluded that spirorenone is 
absorbed before it isomerizes. Furthermore, an in 
vitro comparison found that drospirenone isomerized 
in pH 1 acid with a profile similar to spirorenone. 
The court found that the drugs were closely related 
in that they are both (1) acid-sensitive at similar 
rates, (2) steroids having the same pharmacological 
properties, (3) derivatives of the same drug, 

(4) of the same chemical composition except for 
one bond, and (5) from the same family of substances. 
The court then concluded that a person of 
ordinary skill would find the drugs closely related, 
and would therefore access these studies when formulating 
drospirenone. He would be led to believe 
that drospirenone, like spirorenone, may absorb in 
vivo, but isomerize in vitro. 
Bayer argues now that the district court ignored 
key differences between drospirenone and spirorenone, 
such as that the former isomerizes 40% faster 
than the latter, and that drospirenone is more soluble 
and thus could dissolve and isomerize in acid 
faster. This is irrelevant because the Krause series 
prior art is not an anticipatory reference. It can be 
used to show that a drug formulator having ordinary 
skill had a viable known option to consider with 
micronized, unprotected drospirenone, and a reasonable 
expectation that drospirenone would perform 
similarly (even if not identically) to the 
spirorenone in the Krause series. See O'Farrell, 853 
F.2d at 903-904 (“Obviousness does not require absolute 
predictability of success ... all that is required 
is a reasonable expectation of success.”). 

Similarly, Bayer argued that the Nickisch article 
teaches that drospirenone isomerizes when exposed 
to acid in vitro, teaching away from allowing 
exposure to the gastric environment, and thus suggesting 
the need for an enteric coating. Barr attacked 
the merits of the study as it would apply to

575 F.3d 1341, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1569 

(Cite as: 575 F.3d 1341) 

the practice of drospirenone in vivo, noting that 
Nickisch did not test drospirenone in vivo to correlate 
its in vitro findings. Barr also challenged the 
Nickisch reference on the grounds that *1350 drospirenone 
was found to isomerize slowly and would 
not have isomerized before the stomach emptied, 
that the in vitro environment was too extreme to be 
compared to an in vivo practice, and that it did not 
explain its testing protocols. The court found that a 
person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize 
that Nickisch establishes that drospirenone isomerizes 
in vitro, but would be alerted to the study's 
shortcomings when used in vivo. 

At this point, a person having ordinary skill in 
the art has reached a crossroads where he must 
choose between two known options: delivery of micronized 
drospirenone by a normal pill following 
the spirorenone analogy in the Krause series, or delivery 
of drospirenone by an enteric-coated pill following 
the Nickisch teaching that the drug needs to 
be protected from the stomach. This is a finite number 
of identified, predictable solutions. See KSR. 
550 U.S. at 421, 127 S.Ct. 1727. The prior art 
would have funneled the formulator toward these 
two options; he would not have been required to try 
all possibilities in a field unreduced by the prior art, 
thus avoiding the first pitfall of O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 
at 903. Additionally, the prior art was not vague in 
pointing toward a general approach or area of exploration, 
but rather guided the formulator precisely 
to the use of either a normal pill or an entericcoated 
pill, thus avoiding the second pitfall of 
O'Farrell. Id. Because the selection of micronized 
drospirenone in a normal pill led to the result anticipated 
by the Krause series, the invention would 
have been obvious. See KSR, 550 U.S. at 421, 127 
S.Ct. 1727. 

CONCLUSION 

Accordingly, the judgment of the United States 
District Court for the District of New Jersey is affirmed. 


AFFIRMED 

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

With all respect to my colleagues, I do not 
share their view that it would have been obvious to 
do that which was indisputably unobvious to the 
experienced formulation scientists whose assignment 
was to formulate the known product drospirenone. 
The evidence showed, without contradiction, 
that it was known that micronized drospirenone 
rapidly degraded at the acidity of stomach acid. 
The evidence showed, without contradiction, that 
the Bayer scientists working in this field believed 
that the product required an enteric coating in order 
to prevent degradation in the stomach, upon ingestion 
as an oral contraceptive. Yet my colleagues, 
employing their own expertise, hold that since the 
scientists working in this field turned out to be mistaken, 
it would have been obvious that it was not 
necessary to take steps to prevent acid degradation. 
The court discounts the testimony of the scientists 
themselves, ignores the knowledge concerning this 
product and its instability in acid, ignores the textbook 
teachings, and finds that this unlikely process 
obviously should have been tried. That is not the 
law of obviousness. 

The statutory criterion is whether the invention 
would have been obvious to persons of ordinary 
skill at the time of the invention, not whether it is 
sufficiently simple to appear obvious to judges after 
the discovery is finally made, despite the years of 
contrary belief among the scientists charged with 
the project. At the time that the Bayer scientists 
were attempting to formulate drospirenone as an oral 
contraceptive, the textbook teaching was that micronizing 
acid-sensitive products would accelerate 
their acid-induced degradation. See, e.g., Aulton's 
Pharmaceutics: The Design and Manufacture of 
*1351 Medicines (advising against micronizing 
acid-sensitive drugs because it reduces the drug's 
bioavailability). My colleagues criticize these specialists, 
and rule that it was nonetheless obvious to 
conduct experiments that they believed would not 
work. The court rules that the scientists should have 
“tried” that which they believed would fail, and that 
when they eventually did try this unlikely formula

tion, and it succeeded, it was obvious to do so. 

The unusual physiological behavior of drospirenone 
in the stomach was not known; this knowledge 
followed as scientific explanation; it did not 
precede the invention in suit. There was no evidence 
to reasonably suggest that micronized drospirenone 
was likely to be usable, with 99+ percent 
consistency of effectiveness, without any protection 
from degradation by stomach acid. A usable contraceptive 
requires virtually complete effectiveness, 
and the standard confronting the Bayer scientists 
was high. Unlike the unrelated drugs cited by the 
panel majority, contraceptives require complete effectiveness. 
Previously known oral contraceptives 
such as progesterone and spironolactone are not 
acid sensitive, and drospirenone presented a highly 
specific challenge to the formulation scientists. The 
Bayer scientists believed that the way of avoiding 
the known acid degradation of drospirenone was to 
protect it from acid. My colleagues, however, find 
that it would have been obvious to expose it to acid, 
although it was not obvious to the scientists working 
on the project. 

“Obviousness” requires that the subject matter 
was obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the field 
of the invention. The law does not hold it “obvious 
to try” experiments that contravene conventional 
knowledge, and that are not deemed reasonably 
likely to succeed. The evidence in this case is a better 
measure of obviousness than is the hindsight 
science of judges, for the scientists who eventually 
made this discovery testified, without dispute, that 
they did not believe an uncoated micronized 
product would meet the demanding criteria of contraceptive 
effectiveness. The Court in KSR International 
Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 
1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007) explained that the 
standard for “obvious to try” is whether there was a 
“reasonable expectation of success” at the time. It 
was undisputed that there was not. It was undisputed 
that it was not reasonably expected that uncoated 
micronized drospirenone would be 99+% effective 
as an oral contraceptive when ingested into 

the acidic stomach, when it was known to degrade 
rapidly in acid. 

The district court stated that micronization was 
a “viable” option, and that although success was 
“uncertain,” the invention was obvious to try. 
However, “viability” is not the standard. 
“Viability” implies that the experiment may or may 
not succeed. What the law requires is not guesswork, 
not dumb luck, but a reasonable degree of 
predictability of success. My colleagues depart 
from the statutory standard, in ruling that persons 
of ordinary skill would have conducted experiments 
that were expected to fail. Nothing in the prior art 
teaches the likelihood of success of ingestion of uncoated 
micronized drospirenone; what is taught is 
the likelihood of failure. 

The invention must be viewed as a whole. With 
the existing knowledge that drospirenone is both 
hydrophobic and that it degrades rapidly in acid, 
and the existing knowledge that micronization, although 
useful to counteract a drug's hydrophobic 
properties, renders the drug even more *1352 susceptible 
to acid degradation, it was not shown that a 
person of ordinary skill in this field would have had 
a reasonable expectation of achieving complete 
contraceptive bioavailability and effectiveness with 
uncoated micronized drospirenone. The contrary 
view has surfaced only in this litigation-induced argument. 
The exercise of judicial expertise to override 
the clear evidence of how persons of skill in 
this field actually behaved, is inappropriate. 

I respectfully dissent.

and then entered a judgment of noninfringement. 
Plaintiffs appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Schall, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) term “base section” in patents meant bottom 
support structure of snowmobile seat; 
(2) it was proper to interpret term “base section” 
consistently across all of the asserted patents; 
(3) term “adjacent” in patent meant next to or adjoining; 
and 
(4) discovery-related motions were rendered moot 
by affirmance of judgment of noninfringement.

**1 This is a patent infringement case. Boss In


FN1

dustries, Inc. and James Atherley (together 
“Boss”), appeal the final judgment of the United 
States District Court for the District of Utah, holding 
that Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., Inc. 
(“Yamaha”) did not infringe numerous claims of 
Boss's U.S. Patent Nos. 6,086,149 (“the '149 patent”), 
6,386,630 (“the '630 patent”), and 6,585,317 
(“the '317 patent”). In particular, Boss appeals the 
district court's claim construction of several terms 
in the claims asserted against Yamaha. Boss Indus., 
Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., No. 
2:05CV00422 (D.Utah Sept. 7, 2007) (“Claim Construction 
”). Based on the court's Claim Construction, 
Boss conceded that it could not prove Yamaha 
infringed the asserted claims as construed and 
therefore stipulated to noninfringement. Accordingly, 
the district court entered judgment of noninfringement 
in favor of Yamaha and simultaneously 
dismissed all of Yamaha's counterclaims. Boss Indus., 
Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., No. 
2:05CV00422 (D.Utah Mar. 13, 2008) (“Judgment 
”). In addition, Boss appeals the district court's 
denial of two discovery motions related to 
Yamaha's invalidity counterclaims. Because the 
district court's construction of the dispositive claim 
terms is correct and because Boss has stipulated to 
noninfringement under the district court's construc

tions, we affirm. 

FN1. James Atherley is the inventor of the 
patents-in-suit and granted Boss a sole and 
exclusive license to all rights in the pat-
ents-in-suit. 

DISCUSSION 
I. 
Boss is the owner of the '149, the '630, and the '317 
patents. All three patents share nearly identical disclosures 
and issued from related applications in a 
patent family, including a “parent” patent and three 
“child” continuations-in-part patents. All three pat-
ents-in-suit are continuations-in-part from parent 


FN2 

U.S. Patent No. 5,944,380 (“the '380 patent”). 
Additionally, the '630 patent is a continuation-
in-part of the '149 patent, while the '317 patent is a 
continuation-in-part of both the '149 and '630 patents. 
FN2. Boss did not assert the '380 patent 
against Yamaha. 

All three patents-in-suit are identically titled and 
directed to a “Light-Weight Snowmobile Seat.” ' 
149 patent, '630 patent, '317 patent. This light


weight snowmobile seat contains a “rigid base section 
for mounting on a snowmobile.” See, e.g., '149 
patent Abstract. In reference to figure 4 below, the 
“base section” 40 of the snowmobile seat 10 is a 
“closed-cell structure” and is “substantially rigid 
and provides support for the seat.” Id. col.4 
ll.20-22. According to the patents, “[t]he closed-
cell base section 40 is a significant improvement 
over prior art seats utilizing metal or plastic frames 
and open cell foam cushioning because the closed-
cell structure*533 forms a substantially rigid base 
without adding weight or absorbing water.” See, 
e.g., id. col.4 ll.34-39. A flexible seat section 60 is 
placed in an indentation 54 on the upper surface 52 
of the base section 40. Id. col.4 l.60-col.5 l.1. “The 
upper surface 52 of the base section 40 may also 
form part of the upper surface 20 of the seat 10. ” 
Id. col.4 ll.64-65. The snowmobile rider sits on the 
upper surface of the seat section 62 or the upper 
surface of the base section 52, if the base section's 
upper surface is exposed. Id. col.5 ll.1-10.

In further detail, “[t]he base section 40 has a 
lower surface 42 that forms at least part of the bottom 
22 ” of the snowmobile seat. '149 patent col.4 
ll.44-45. The bottom 22 is disposed on the snowmobile, 
which is generally indicated at 23. Id. col.4 
ll.8-10. The bottom of the base section 40 also 
forms cavities, for example cavity 46, “so that seat 
10 fits around various snowmobile components, 
such as a gas tank, an engine, a battery, etc.” Id. 
col.4 ll.58-60. The base section 40 is attached to the 
top of the snowmobile 23-for example, using 
fasteners with one portion 93 located on the snowmobile 
and the other portion 91 located on the 
lower surface 42 of the base section 40, which contacts 
the snowmobile. Id. col.5 ll.54-65. 

Claim 1 of the '149 patent is representative of 
the claims on appeal: 

1. A snowmobile seat comprising: 
a generally rigid base section having a lower surface 
for mounting on a snowmobile and an upper 
surface; 

a flexible seat section disposed on the base section 
and having an upper surface on which a rider 
may sit and a lower surface, the flexible seat section 
being formed of a compressible, open-cell 
material which compresses and deflects under 
force; 

a space disposed between the lower surface of the 
rigid base section and the upper surface of the 
flexible seat section and defining an air chamber, 
the space being formed at least partially by the 
flexible seat section; 

cover means for covering at least a portion of the 
base and seat sections; and 

*534 at least one air passage extending from the 
air chamber; 

the flexible seat section deflecting between (i) a

II. 
Yamaha sells a variety of snowmobiles and 
snowmobile seats. On May 12, 2005, Boss filed a 
patent infringement suit against Yamaha in the 
United States District Court for the District of Utah, 
alleging that Yamaha's “Viper” seats infringe 
claims 1-3, 6, 8, 20, and 21 of the '149 Patent; 
claims 19, 21, and 23 of the '630 Patent; and claims 
5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, and 18 of the ' 317 Patent. Boss 
also alleged that Yamaha's “Apex” seats infringe 
claim 21 of the '630 Patent, and claims 12 and 13 of 

FN3

the '317 Patent. On July 7, 2005, Yamaha 
answered, asserting numerous counterclaims including 
that the patents-in-suit were not infringed, 
and were invalid and unenforceable. 

FN3. The record does not clearly reflect 
which claims the Apex seats allegedly infringe. 
Although the district court's judgment 
states that the Apex seats are accused 
of infringing only claim 21 of the '630 patent 
and claims 12 and 13 of the '317 patent 
, see Judgment, slip op. at 2, Boss indicated 
in its post-claim construction status 
report to the district court that claims 16 
and 18 of the '317 patent were asserted as 
well. Neither party addresses this discrepancy 
in their briefing. Regardless, claims 
16 and 18 of the '317 patent both contain 
the limitation “base section,” which, as explained 
below, Boss concedes is missing 
from the accused Apex seats as currently 
construed. Thus, because we affirm the 
district court's construction of “base section,” 
we consequently find that claims 16 
and 18 of the '317 patent cannot be infringed. 


Following extensive briefing and a Markman 
hearing on June 14, 2007, the district court issued a 
detailed claim construction order on September 7, 
2007. See Claim Construction. In its order, the 
court construed fifteen disputed claim limitations. 
See id. While the constructions of the majority of 
these limitations have been appealed, the constructions 
of two limitations are particularly important. 

FN4

These limitations are “base” or “base section,” 
and “adjacent.” 

FN4. The terms “base section” and “base” 
are used interchangeably in the patents-
in-suit and neither party has differentiated 
between the terms. In addition, the district 
court treated the terms as the same during 
claim construction. See Claim Construction, 
slip op. at 12. As such, we will treat 
the terms “base section” and “base” the 
same on appeal and will refer to both collectively 
as “base section.” 

**3 The term “base section” appears in all 
three patents-in-suit and in all of the asserted 
claims, except for claim 5 of the '317 patent. The 
term “adjacent” appears in claims 5, 7, and 8 of the 
'317 patent. After a detailed review of the claim 
language, the patents' specifications, and the prosecution 
histories, the court construed “base section” 
for all three patents-in-suit as “the bottom 
support structure of the snowmobile seat.” Claim 
Construction, slip op. at 20. Following a similar detailed 
analysis, the court construed “adjacent” as 
“next to or adjoining.” Id. at 32. 

After the court issued its Claim Construction, 
Boss filed a post-claim construction status report, 
stating that “[a]s a result of the court's claim construction, 
the court should rule as a matter of law 
that Yamaha's accused snowmobile seats do not infringe 
any of the asserted claims of the Boss Patents.” 
Boss then requested the court to enter summary 
judgment of noninfringement*535 of all its 
asserted claims. Additionally, Boss listed each of 
the limitations as construed that were missing from 
the accused products, specifically indicating that

either “base section” or “adjacent” were missing 
from all of the asserted claims. Accordingly, the 
district court “enter[ed] judgment of non-
infringement, both literally and under the doctrine 
of equivalents, in favor of Yamaha on all claims in 
Boss's Amended Complaint.” Judgment, slip op. at 
2-3. The court also dismissed Yamaha's counterclaims. 
Id. at 3. 

In addition to claim construction, the district 
court also addressed issues that Boss raised concerning 
Yamaha's alleged discovery abuses. Because 
of Yamaha's alleged discovery misconduct, 
Boss filed a first motion (“Motion to Preclude”), 
urging the court to preclude certain witness testimony 
and evidence, which, according to Boss, 
Yamaha belatedly produced. Boss filed a second 
motion (“Adverse Inference Motion”) that was 
based on Yamaha's alleged failure to “institute a litigation 
hold after being served with Boss's Complaint.” 
Boss argued that Yamaha's failure to issue 
a litigation hold caused the destruction of relevant 
documents, prevented Boss from obtaining vital information, 
and therefore warranted an adverse inference 
instruction. 

On January 22, 2007, the district court denied 
Boss's Motion to Preclude “[f]or the reasons stated 
by Yamaha in its response to Plaintiff's motion.” 
Boss Indus., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., 
No. 2:05CV00422, slip op. at 3 (D.Utah Jan. 22, 
2007). The court gave no further explanation. Id. 
Because it was unclear why the court denied Boss's 
previous Motion to Preclude, Boss requested reconsideration, 
or clarification, of the court's denial. 

On March 13, 2008, in the Judgment, the court 
denied both Boss's Adverse Inference Motion and 
its motion for reconsideration, or for clarification, 
of the court's previous denial of its Motion to Preclude. 
Judgment, slip op. at 3. The court did not 
provide an explanation. Rather, it stated that “upon 
review and consideration of the memoranda and 
other materials submitted therewith, the Court 
denies both motions on the merits.” 

III. 
**4 Boss appeals the district court's claim construction 
and the district court's denial of its two 
discovery-related motions. We have jurisdiction 
over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 
Boss acknowledged, in its post-claim construction 
status report to the district court and in its briefing 
to this court, that all of the accused products do not 
contain either the “base section” or “adjacent” limitations 
under the district court's construction. As 
such, because of Boss's concessions and because infringement 
requires each claim limitation to be satisfied, 
see BMC Res., Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 
F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2007) (“Direct infringement 
requires a party to perform each and every 
step or element of a claimed method or product.”), 
if we find that the district court correctly construed 
both of the limitations “base section” and 
“adjacent,” we must affirm the judgment of noninfringement 
in favor of Yamaha. Because “base section” 
and “adjacent” are dispositive if we affirm the 
district court's construction, we address those limitations 
first. 

Claim construction is a question of law that we 
review de novo. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., 138 
F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). The 
words of a claim “ ‘are generally given their ordinary 
and customary meaning,’ ” according to a person 
of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. 
Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 
1312-13 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en *536 banc) (quoting 
Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 
1576, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996)). The claims themselves 
provide “substantial” guidance as to the meaning of 
claim terms. Id. at 1314. However, the claims must 
be read in light of the specification, the “ ‘single 
best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.’ ” Id. 
at 1315 (quoting Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582). 

A. 
We first turn to the “base section” limitation, 
which appears in all but one of the asserted claims. 
More particularly, “base section” is found in claims 
1-3, 6, 8, 20, and 21 of the '149 patent; claims 19,

21, and 23 of the ' 630 patent; and claims 7, 8, 12, 
13, 16, and 18 of the '317 patent. As noted, the district 
court construed this limitation to have a single 
meaning for all three of the patents-in-suit: “the 
bottom support structure of the snowmobile seat.” 
Claim Construction, slip op. at 20. 

According to Boss, notwithstanding the fact 
that the patents' specifications are nearly identical, 
each patent should have a different construction for 
the term “base section”: 

The '149 Patent: “a cellular structure that forms at 
least part of the bottom of the seat.” 

The '630 Patent: “a cellular structure that forms at 
least part of the bottom of the seat and which can 
be directly or indirectly mounted to the snowmobile.” 


The '317 Patent: “a cellular structure that forms at 
least a part of the bottom of the seat and which 
can be mounted to other support structure that in 
turn can be mounted to the snowmobile.” 

**5 Boss argues that the district court erred by 
construing “base section” identically for all three 
patents because “the specifications of the Boss Patents 
successively broaden the scope of ‘base section.’ 
” Specifically, Boss highlights that each patent 
has a slightly different disclosure-including several 
unique sections in the '630 and '317 patents that 
do not appear the other patents-to support its contention 
that “base section” should be construed differently 
for each patent. Also, Boss argues that the 
district court incorrectly limited “base section” to 
the preferred embodiments. 

Yamaha counters that the district court's construction 
of “base section” is supported by the all 
three patents' claims and specifications. In addition, 
Yamaha points out that both the preferred and alternative 
embodiments indicate that the “base section” 
is the bottom structure that provides support. 
Moreover, Yamaha argues that Boss's proposed 
constructions import unnecessary limitations into 

the claims and misinterpret the patents' specifications. 


[1][2] We hold that the district court correctly 
construed “base section” as the “bottom support 
structure of the snowmobile seat.” Contrary to 
Boss's arguments, the district court's construction“
bottom support structure of the snowmobile 
seat”-does not improperly limit “base section” to a 
preferred embodiment. Rather, it is in accordance 
with the entirety of each patents' intrinsic evidence. 
See, e.g., Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314-15 
(emphasizing a patent's intrinsic evidence as particularly 
important to claim construction); Alloc, Inc. 

v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 342 F.3d 1361, 1370-71 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (looking to “whether the specification 
read as a whole suggests that the very character 
of the invention requires” a particular claim construction). 
In addition, because each patent-in-suit 
is derived from the same parent application and 
shares many common terms with its sister patents, 
the district court correctly interpreted “base section” 
consistently across all of the asserted *537 
patents. See NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, Ltd., 
418 F.3d 1282, 1293 (Fed.Cir.2005) (“Because 
NTP's patents all derive from the same parent application 
and share many common terms, we must 
interpret the claims consistently across all asserted 
patents.”); Jonsson v. Stanley Works, 903 F.2d 812, 
818 (Fed.Cir.1990) (“The '912 patent is the result of 
a continuation-in-part application from the original 
'008 application, which led to the '251 patent. 
Hence ... the construction of the term ‘diffuse light’ 
contained in that patent, is relevant to an understanding 
of ‘diffuse light’ as that term is used in the 
'912 patent.”). 
We begin by looking at the claim language itself, 
which is instructive of the proper construction 
of “base section.” See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314 
(“[T]he claims themselves provide substantial guidance 
as to the meaning of particular claim terms.”). 
Several claims at issue in each patent indicate that 
the “base section” has a “lower surface for mounting 
on a snowmobile” and that “a flexible seat sec

tion [is] disposed on the base section ... on which a 
rider may sit.” '149 patent col.9 ll.53-57; col.12 
ll.31-38; see '317 patent col. 10 ll.65-67; col. 11 
ll.19-25 (claiming that the flexible seat section, 
upon which the rider sits, is placed on top of the 
base section); '630 patent col.11 ll.41-44 (claiming 
that a flexible seat section is disposed on a generally 
rigid base section); col.12 ll.18-23 (claiming “a 
substantially rigid base section, supporting the flexible 
seat section,” upon which a rider may sit). Other 
claims similarly state that the base section “has a 
bottom surface configured to abut an upper surface 
of the track tunnel of the snowmobile” and that “the 
rigid base section provides a desired shape and 
structure of the seat.” '317 patent col.11 ll.25-29; 
col.12 ll.10-13, 42-46. In addition, certain unasserted 
claims likewise suggest that the “base section” 
must be the bottom structure of the seat. See, e.g., 
Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314 (“unasserted [claims] can 
also be valuable sources of enlightenment”). For 
example, several such claims indicate that the “base 
section” includes “fasteners” to couple the seat to 
the body of the snowmobile. See, e.g., '317 patent 
col. 10 ll.28-61 (“fasteners being coupled on the 
lower surface of the base section and configured to 
be coupled to the snowmobile to resist horizontal 
movement between the base section and the snowmobile”); 
'630 patent col.20 ll.5-16 (“fasteners, 
configured to be coupled between the base section 
and the snowmobile” to resist movement between 
the base section and the snowmobile); '149 patent 
col.10 ll.30-35 (“fasteners being coupled on the 
lower surface of the base section and configured to 
be coupled to the snowmobile”). The fact that the 
base section abuts, mounts, and fastens to the upper 
portion of the snowmobile body indicates that it 
must be the bottom of the snowmobile seat. Indeed, 
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to mount the 
base section to the top of the snowmobile, using the 
fasteners on the base section's bottom, if the base 
section was not the bottom of the snowmobile seat. 
Similarly, that the base section is placed underneath 
the flexible seat section and that it provides the 
shape of the snowmobile seat, certainly denotes that 
the base section provides support for the snow


mobile seat upon which the rider sits. 

**6 While the claims provide guidance, the 
district court's construction of “base section” is further 
confirmed, and consistently explained in detail, 
by each patents' specification. See Phillips, 415 
F.3d at 1315 (acknowledging that the specification 
is “always highly relevant” and usually dispositive). 
The patents' specifications emphasize exactly 
what was described in the claims-that the base section 
has a bottom surface that is disposed on, and 
abuts, the *538 snowmobile body and an upper surface 
for placing a flexible seat section upon which 
the rider may sit. See '149 patent col.2 ll.40-45; 
col.4 ll.8-13; col.6 ll.33-34; see also '630 patent 
col.3 ll.35-36 (“The front 24, like the bottom 22, 
abuts the snowmobile 23.”); col.4 ll.25-26 (“The 
seat section 60 has an upper surface 62 on which a 
rider may sit.”); col.6 ll.3-4 (“bottom 222 disposed 
on the snowmobile 23”); '317 patent col.2 ll.1-3 (“a 
substantially rigid base disposed over an upper surface 
of a track tunnel of a snowmobile.”), ll.15-17 
(“the base section or bottom thereof can abut directly 
to the upper surface of the track tunnel of the 
snowmobile.”); col.3 ll.55-58 (same). Again reiterating 
the claim language, each specification explains 
that the bottom surface of the base section 
includes fasteners, hooks, or rails for coupling the 
base section to the body of the snowmobile. See, 
e.g., '149 patent col.2 l.65-col.3 l.25 (“fasteners are 
coupled on the lower surface of the base section 
and coupled to the snowmobile to resist horizontal 
movement”); col.5 ll.54-65; col.8 ll.53-58; '630 patent 
col.2 ll.13-27; col.5 ll.11-35; col.8 ll.8-45; '317 
patent col.6 ll.5-20. Moreover, the same point is reflected 
in all the figures in each patent. For example, 
figure 4 of each patent discloses joining the 
snowmobile seat to the snowmobile body using a 
pair of fasteners-one fastener 91 located on the 
lower surface of the base section and the other 
fastener 90 located on the upper surface of the 
snowmobile 23. See, e.g., '630 patent fig.4; see also 
'630, '317, '140 patents fig. 10 (showing a different 
embodiment of the snowmobile seat, but still disclosing 
one fastener on the on the bottom of the

base section and another fastener on the top of the 
snowmobile body). Thus, the base section is required 
to be the bottom structure of the snowmobile 
seat. 

Further emphasizing that the base section is the 
bottom structure of the snowmobile seat, the base 
section consists of formed cavities that fit around 
various components located on the snowmobile itself, 
such as the gas tank, engine, and battery. '630 
patent col.4 ll.14-16; '149 patent col.4 ll.58-60; '317 
patent col.2 ll.2-32 (describing various indentations 
in the base section to “match” components on the 
snowmobile body). In this way, the base section 
can act as a “leak barrier between the snowmobile 
components ... and the flexible seat section,” which 
is placed on top of the base section. ' 317 patent 
col.2 ll.27-30; see, e.g., '630 patent col.3 ll.47-50 
(explaining that the base section “does not absorb 
moisture or water”); ' 149 patent col.4 ll.25-28 
(same). If the base section was not the bottom of 
the snowmobile seat, it would not need to be 
formed with cavities to “match” the shape of the 
snowmobile body and components; nor could it 
protect the flexible seat section from leaking snowmobile 
components. 

**7 The patents' specifications similarly reiterate 
that the base section is the support structure of 
the snowmobile seat. Specifically, each patents' 
specification states that the “base section ... is substantially 
rigid and provides support for the seat [ 
],” '149 patent col.4 ll.21; col.6 ll.38-40; '630 patent 
col.3 ll.42-43; col.6 ll.7-9; '317 patent col.4 ll.5-7; 
col.7 ll.1-3, and “provide[s] strength and rigidity,” ' 
630 patent col.3 ll.47-48; '149 patent col.4 ll.24-26; 
'317 patent col.4 ll.20-22. The statement in the specification 
that the base section “prevents the seat 
from collapsing onto the snowmobile components” 
and “provide[s] the desired shape and structure of 
the seat,” '317 patent col.2 ll.23-25; col.4 ll.24-26; 
col.4 l.64-col.5 l.5, further suggests that the base 
section is the support structure. 

Boss cites several portions of the patents-
in-suit, suggesting both that its proposed construc


tions are correct and that *539 the district court's 
construction is unduly narrow. In emphasizing 
these excerpts, however, Boss attempts to read unnecessary 
limitations into the claims and misinter


FN5

prets the specification.

FN5. We also note that Boss' proposal to 
construe “base section” differently for each 
patent is contrary to its initial suggestion, 
in the district court, that the limitation 
should be construed identically across all 
three patents. 

Arguing that the “base section” should be only 
“at least a part of the bottom” of the snowmobile 
seat, Boss stresses that each patent explains that the 
“base section 40 has a lower surface 42 that forms 
at least part of the bottom 22.” See, e.g., '317 Patent 
col.4 ll.44-45 (emphasis added); see also '149 patent 
col.4 ll.44-45; '630 patent col.3 ll.66-67. Boss, 
however, misinterprets these statements in the specifications. 
Tellingly, the “at least part of the bottom 
22” of the snowmobile seat language does not 
describe the entire base section 40. Instead, as clarified 
in figure 4, the “at least a part of the bottom 22 
” language only describes the “lower surface 42. ” 
In other words, the “bottom 22” of the snowmobile 
seat consists of at least a “lower surface 42” of the 
base section, but may consist of another surface on 
the bottom of the base section-i.e., a surface higher 
than the lower surface, but still part of the bottom 

FN6

of the base section.Indeed, the “lower surface 
42” forms a part of the bottom 22, while the higher 
surface, indicated by 46, forms the remaining part 

FN7

of the bottom 22.Thus, the higher and lower 
surfaces form the entire bottom of the snowmobile 
seat. Logically, because both the higher and lower 
surfaces are part of the base section, the base section 
is therefore the bottom structure of the snowmobile 
seat. 

FN6. A “higher surface” should not be 
confused with the “upper surface” of the 
base section, which is exemplified by 52 
and 54 in figure 4. The “upper surface” is 
on the top of the base section, and the rider

either sits directly on the “upper surface” 
or on a “flexible seat section” placed on 
the “upper surface.” See, e.g., '317 patent 
col.5 ll.6-23. In contrast, the “higher surface” 
refers to a surface higher than lower 
surface, but nonetheless still on the bottom 
of the base section. See, e.g., '317 patent 
fig.4. Accordingly, both the higher and 
lower surfaces make up the bottom of the 
base section, which abuts the snowmobile 
body. 

FN7. We recognize that the patents' specifications 
describe item 46 in figure 4 as 
“additional cavities.” See, e.g., '149 patent 
col.4 l.58. We in no way contradict this 
disclosure, but, because the higher surface 
in figure 4 is not labeled, we simply use 46 
as a convenient reference. 

Next, Boss cites the specification language 
stating that the base section, or bottom thereof, can 
be “directly or indirectly mounted on the snowmobile.” 
This suggests to Boss that the base section 
for all patents need only be “at least a part of the 
bottom” of the snowmobile seat. See '630 patent 
col.3 ll.31-32; col.3 l.67-col.4 l.1; col.6 ll.19-21. 
Because this statement only appears in the '630 patent, 
Boss also argues that its unique construction of 
base section in the '630 patent is correct. This disclosure, 
however, does not further explain the difference 
between directly and indirectly mounting 
and does not prevent the base section from being 
the “bottom support structure of the snowmobile.” 
Rather, based on the entirety of the intrinsic evidence, 
including these specific statements, the base 
section can still be indirectly mounted to the snowmobile 
while being the “bottom” structure of the 
snowmobile seat. Moreover, the other portions of 
the specifications, which more clearly discuss 
mounting the snowmobile seat to the snowmobile 
body, disclose using “hook-and-loop type fasteners” 
or the “snap type fasteners.” See, e.g., ' 630 
patent col.5 ll.10-35; col.8 ll.8-61. Not only do 
neither *540 of these mounting fasteners preclude 

the base section from being the bottom structure, 
but they in fact support that the base section must 
be the bottom structure of the snowmobile seat. As 
explained, mounting the base section to the top of 
the snowmobile-using the fasteners on the base section's 
bottom-would be difficult unless the base section 
was the bottom of the snowmobile seat. As 
such, if the base section is “indirectly mounted on 
the snowmobile” using either of these fastener-
types, the base section is nonetheless the “bottom 
support structure of the snowmobile seat.” 

**8 Boss also points out that the '317 patent 
states that “the base structure can be mounted to 
other support structure that in turn can be mounted 
on the track tunnel.” See '317 patent col.4 ll.14-16. 
According to Boss, this statement both proves its 
different construction for the '317 patent and that, 
because the base section can be mounted to an additional 
support structure, the base section is not necessarily 
the bottom support structure. Boss, 
however, overlooks that this statement is not inconsistent 
with the base section being the bottom support 
structure of the snowmobile seat, despite being 
mounted to another support structure. In fact, the 
cited passage suggests that the “other support structure” 
is not part of the snowmobile seat, but rather 
is part of the snowmobile body or is independent 
from any other part. The claim construction, 
however, requires the base section to be the 
“bottom support structure of the snowmobile seat.” 
As such, even assuming the “other support structure” 
provides some support to the bottom of the 
seat, it is neither the bottom structure nor the support 
structure of the snowmobile seat. Thus, the 
base section remains both the bottom structure and 
the support structure of the snowmobile seat. 

For the foregoing reasons, we hold the district 
court correctly construed “base section” for all 
three patents-in-suit to mean the “bottom support 
structure of the snowmobile seat.” We have considered 
Boss's additional arguments on this issue, 
but find them unpersuasive.

We now address the construction of “adjacent.” 
This limitation explicitly appears only in independent 
claim 5 of the '317 patent, but it is also required 
in dependent claims 7 and 8 by dependency from 
claim 5. The district court construed this limitation 
as “next to or adjoining.” Claim Construction, slip 
op. at 32. 

Boss argues that this term should be construed 
as “close to.” Boss contends that the district court 
inappropriately limited the definition of “adjacent” 
and, in doing so, excluded certain embodiments in 
the '317 patent. According to Boss, the proper construction 
would cover all of the disclosed embodiments. 
Specifically, Boss points to figures 4 and 10 
in the '317 patent, emphasizing that its proposed 
construction-“close to”-would encompass both disclosed 
figures, whereas the district court's construction 
excludes the embodiment shown in figure 4. 

Yamaha responds that the intrinsic evidence, 
the claims, and ordinary meaning support the district 
court's construction. In particular, Yamaha argues 
that the '317 patent's specification use of 
“adjacent” to describe “corners formed by adjacent 
sides of the base section 240,” col.9 l.52, confirms 
“the concept of next to or adjoining.” Yamaha also 
contends that, contrary to Boss's suggestion, the 
court's construction “does not exclude any embodiments 
from the scope of the invention because other 
claims are available to cover those embodiments.” 


*541 **9 [3] We agree with the district court 
that the correct construction of “adjacent” in the ' 
317 patent is “next to or adjoining.” Although the 
term “adjacent” is a commonly understood word, 
we still look to the intrinsic evidence for the proper 
construction. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1321 (“the 
specification is ‘the single best guide to the meaning 
of a disputed term’ ”) (quoting Vitronics, 90 
F.3d at 1582); id. (“[T]he “ordinary meaning” of a 
claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan 
after reading the entire patent.”). 

Turning to the pertinent claim language, claim 

5 states “a storage section, disposed adjacent the 
flexible seat section, having a storage cavity formed 
therein.” '317 patent col. 11 ll.3-4. While the language 
of claim 5 alone does little to clarify the 
parties' dispute, the figures in the specification support 
the proposition that the term means “next to or 
adjoining.” As shown by figure 10, the storage section 
is directly “next to or adjoining”-not merely 
“close to”-the flexible seat section 260. Id. fig.10. 
In addition, the specification's use of 
“adjacent”-“corners formed between adjacent sides 
of the base section”-supports that “next to or adjoining” 
is the correct construction. Id. col.9 
ll.51-52. Indeed, in order for the sides of the base 
section to form “corners,” the sides would logically 
have to be “next to or adjoining” each other, rather 
than merely “close to” each other. See id. fig.9a 
items 230 and 224. Moreover, this construction, 
gleaned from the intrinsic evidence, is consistent 
with the dictionary definition of “adjacent.” See, 
e.g., American Heritage Dictionary of the English 
Language (4th Ed.2000); Phillips, 415 F.3d at 
1322-23 (acknowledging that a construction “may 
also rely on dictionary definitions ... so long as the 
dictionary definition does not contradict any definition 
found in or ascertained by a reading of the patent 
documents.” (quoting Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1584 

n. 6)). 
Moreover, Boss's proposed construction of 
“close to” and its contentions that the current construction 
of “next to or adjoining” excludes certain 
disclosed embodiments are contradicted by the unasserted 
claims of the '317 patent. See Phillips, 415 
F.3d at 1314 (“Other claims of the patent in question, 
both asserted and unasserted, can also be valuable 
sources of enlightenment as to the meaning of 
a claim term.”); see also PSN Illinois v. Ivoclar 
Vivadent, Inc., 525 F.3d 1159, 1166 (Fed.Cir.2008) 
(“[U]nasserted or cancelled claims may provide 
‘probative evidence’ that an embodiment is not 
within the scope of an asserted claim.”). Indeed, 
this case presents a clear example of the situation in 
which, although alternatively disclosed embodiments 
are not encompassed by the current claim

(Cite as: 333 Fed.Appx. 531, 2009 WL 1475036 (C.A.Fed. (Utah))) 


construction, other unasserted claims cover those 
alternative embodiments. See, e.g., TIP Sys., LLC v. 
Phillips & Brooks/Gladwin, Inc., 529 F.3d 1364, 
1373 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“[T]he mere fact that there is 
an alternative embodiment disclosed in the ... patent 
that is not encompassed by [a] district court's claim 
construction does not outweigh the language of the 
claim, especially when the court's construction is 
supported by the intrinsic evidence.”); PSN Illinois, 
525 F.3d at 1166 (“[C]ourts must recognize that 
disclosed embodiments may be within the scope of 
other allowed but unasserted claims.”). 

**10 Claim 5 reads “a storage section, disposed 
adjacent the flexible seat section.” '317 patent 
col.11 ll.3-4 (emphasis added). Under the current 
construction of “next to or adjoining,” claim 5 
encompasses the embodiment shown in figure 10, 
which discloses the storage section next to the seat 
section. Id. fig.10. Importantly, unasserted independent 
claims 1 and 12, as well as their dependent 
claims, omit the requirement that the storage section 
be “adjacent” *542 the seat section. See, e.g., 
id. col.10 ll.35-36; col.12 ll.25-34. As such, the unasserted 
claims allow the storage section to be in a 
variety of locations, including simply “close to” the 
seat section. The unasserted claims therefore specifically 
encompass the other disclosed embodiments, 
which show the storage section “close to” a 
seat section. See, e.g., id. fig.4 items 60 (seat section) 
and 44 (utility cavity). Construing the limitation 
“adjacent” as “close to,” as urged by Boss, in 
this case would render that limitation in claim 5 essentially 
meaningless in light of the other unasserted 
claims-a construction we cannot accept based 
on the entirety of the intrinsic evidence. See, e.g., 
Ortho-McNeil Pharma., Inc. v. Caraco Pharma. 
Labs., Ltd., 476 F.3d 1321, 1327-28 (Fed.Cir.2007) 
(rejecting a claim construction that would have 
“render[ed] meaningless another claim's limita


FN8

tion”).

FN8. Also, we note that Boss originally 
proposed during claim construction in the 
district court that, if “adjacent” required 

construction, it should be construed as 
“next to.” 

For the foregoing reasons, we hold the district 
court correctly construed “adjacent” as “next to or 
adjoining.” We have considered Boss's additional 
arguments on this issue, but find them unpersuasive. 


In sum, because we have affirmed the district 
court's constructions of “base section” and 
“adjacent,” either of which appear in all of the asserted 
claims, and because Boss stipulated to noninfringement 
under the district court's construction, 
we affirm the summary judgment of noninfringement 
of all claims. 

IV. 
[4] We now turn to Boss's appeal of the district 
court's decision denying its discovery-related sanctions 
motions. Boss does not allege that its discovery 
motions, and the district court's denial of those 
motions, affected its claim construction or infringement 
positions. Rather, Boss apparently acknowledges 
that its discovery motions concerned only 
potential prior art and invalidity issues. As Boss 
correctly acknowledged at oral argument, the discovery 
issues therefore only need to be addressed 
“if the court reverses the claim construction rulings” 
and would only become pertinent on remand. 
See Oral Arg. 39:00-39:20, Jan. 8, 2009, available 
at http:// oralarguments. cafc. uscourts. gov. Thus, 
the only remedies that Boss has requested-namely, 
an adverse inference and preclusion of certain evidence 
at trial-are contingent upon further litigation in 
the district court. We, however, have not reversed 
the district court's claim construction, but rather affirmed 
the court's constructions of the dispositive 
claim terms, and Boss has conceded noninfringement 
under those constructions. Consequently, we 
cannot remand for further litigation in the district 
court and the discovery-related motions therefore 
are moot. See, e.g., Geneva Pharm., Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline 
PLC, 349 F.3d 1373, 1386 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (“Because this court affirms that the 
patents at issue in this case are invalid, the discov©

ery issue is moot.”); Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Calgene, 
Inc., 188 F.3d 1362, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1999) ( “[W]e 
note that in view of our conclusion that the claims 
at issue are invalid as not enabled, the fact that the 
district court did not admit this evidence on the issue 
of infringement is essentially moot.”). 

**11 [5] Nor did Boss appeal the denial of its 
other sanctions motions, which requested sanctions 
not contingent upon remanding for further district 
court litigation and which possibly could have 
provided this court with another avenue to address 
discovery issues. Accordingly, we are unable to 
rule on, not only the district court's *543 denial of 
Boss's discovery motions, but also on any other 
possible discovery abuses that may have occurred 
in the district court. That said, it appears from the 
record presented to us that Yamaha's discovery 
practices were less than commendable. For example, 
on several occasions Yamaha date-stamped 
documents to be filed with the district court using 
the court's time stamp, but did not actually place 
the document in the court's drop-box at that time. 
See Boss Indus., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., 
U.S.A., No. 2:05CV00422, slip op. at 2 (D.Utah 
Feb. 28, 2007) (“ Discovery Order ”). Rather, 
Yamaha actually filed the documents, by placing 
them in the drop-box, several days after the “filed” 
stamp was placed on the documents. Id. After the 
district court realized that this was not an isolated 
incident, but happened several times, it admonished 
Yamaha, stating that “[t]his deceitful conduct will 
not be tolerated” and that this inappropriate practice 
“is particularly egregious when ... the court is liberal 
in granting extensions of time.” Id. slip op. at 
2-3. The court further noted that “counsel in this 
case have been admonished before about the 
gamesmanship that has been taking place in this 
lawsuit.” Id. slip op. at 3. In addition, regarding 
Yamaha's interpretation of communications with 
the district court, the court further characterized 
Yamaha's actions as “unreasonabl[e]” and 
“disingenuous.” Boss Indus., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor 
Corp. U.S.A., No. 2:05CV00422, slip op. at 4 n. 2 
(D.Utah Jan. 23, 2007). This type of conduct during 

litigation is unacceptable and reflects a lack of respect 
for both the opposing party and the court. 

CONCLUSION 

In sum, we affirm the district court's claim constructions 
of “base section” and “adjacent.” We 
therefore affirm the court's grant of summary judgment 
of noninfringement. Because we affirm the 
summary judgment of noninfringement, Boss's appeal 
of the denial of its discovery motions is moot. 

Each party shall bear its own costs.

Background: Competitor brought action against patent 
licensee seeking declaratory judgment of non-
infringement of patent for crystalline cefdinir. The 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Virginia, Robert E. Payne, J., 484 F.Supp.2d 448, construed 
patent, and entered summary judgment of noninfringement, 
491 F.Supp.2d 563. Licensee appealed. In 
another action, licensee brought patent infringement action 
against competitors. The United States District 

Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Wayne R. 
Andersen, J., 486 F.Supp.2d 767, construed patent, and 
denied licensee's motion for preliminary injunction. Licensee 
appealed. Appeals were consolidated. 

Holdings: Following sua sponte order of review en 
banc, the Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held 
that: 

(1) patent was limited to “Crystal A” form of compound; 
(2) process terms in product-by-process claims serve as 
limitations in determining patent infringement; overruling 
Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech, 
Inc., 927 F.2d 1565; 
(3) phrase “obtainable by” introduced limiting process 
steps; 
(4) patent's claims could not be extended under doctrine 
of equivalents to embrace known but unclaimed subject 
matter; and 
(5) district court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
preliminary injunction.

In this case, the same patent, U.S. Patent No. 
4,935,507 (the '507 patent), occasions litigation in both 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District 
of Virginia and the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois. The Virginia District Court 
granted the motion of Lupin Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. (collectively Lupin) for summary judgment 
of noninfringement. In the other case, the Illinois 
District Court denied a preliminary injunction to Abbott 
Laboratories, the exclusive licensee of the '507 patent, 
based on the claim construction from the Eastern District 
of Virginia. 

Because the Eastern District of Virginia correctly 
construed the claims of the '507 patent and correctly 
discerned no genuine issues of material fact on literal 
infringement of claims 2-5 or infringement by equivalents 
of claims 1-5, this court affirms its partial summary 
judgment of noninfringement. Likewise, this court affirms 
the Northern District of Illinois' denial of Abbott's 
motion for a preliminary injunction, based in large part 
on the same correct claim construction.

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

'507 patent under the trade name Omnicef. The Virginia 
case arose when Lupin sought a declaratory judgment of 
noninfringement against Abbott Laboratories and Astellas 
Pharma Inc., the owner of the '507 patent 
(collectively Abbott). The Food and Drug Administration 
had previously approved Lupin's Abbreviated New 
Drug Application (ANDA) to market a generic version 
of Omnicef. Lupin's generic product contains almost exclusively 
the Crystal B form of crystalline cefdinir (cefdinir 
monohydrate), whereas Abbott's Omnicef product 
contains the Crystal A form of crystalline cefdinir (cefdinir 
anhydrate). Further, Lupin makes its products with 
processes other than those claimed in the '507 patent. 
For these reasons, Lupin brought the Virginia action to 
clarify that its proposed product would not infringe a 
valid patent. Abbott counterclaimed for infringement. 
The Eastern District of Virginia construed the claims, 

Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Laboratories, 484 F.Supp.2d 448 
(E.D.Va.2007) ( Lupin CC Order ), and ultimately granted-
in-part Lupin's motion for summary judgment of 
noninfringement, as to both literal and equivalent infringement 
for claims 2-5 and as to equivalent infringement 
for claim 1, Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Labs., 491 
F.Supp.2d 563 (E.D.Va.2007) ( Lupin SJ Order ). The 
parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of 
the remaining claims (invalidity) and counterclaims 
(literal infringement of claim 1). 

In the Illinois action, Abbott sued Sandoz, Inc. and San-
doz GmbH (collectively Sandoz), Teva Pharmaceuticals 
USA, Inc. *1286 and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, 
Ltd. (collectively Teva), Ranbaxy Laboratories, 
Ltd., Ranbaxy, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, 
Inc., and Par Pharmaceutical (all defendants, collectively, 
Sandoz and Teva) for infringement of the '507 
patent. Like Lupin, Sandoz and Teva had previously 
filed ANDAs, seeking to market generic versions of 

Omnicef. Abbott sought a preliminary injunction in the 
Illinois case. For purposes of that motion, the parties 
agreed to adopt the Eastern District of Virginia's claim 
construction from the Lupin case. Abbott Labs. v. San-
doz, Inc., 486 F.Supp.2d 767 (N.D.Ill.2007) ( Sandoz PI 
Order ). Despite this agreement, the parties to the San-
doz case disagreed as to how to interpret some of the 
Eastern District of Virginia's constructions, necessitating 
some clarification by the Northern District of 
Illinois. 486 F.Supp.2d at 770-71 (disputing “Crystal 
A,” “peaks,” and “about,” and seeking construction of 
“powder X-ray diffraction pattern,” which the Eastern 
District of Virginia had not defined). Ultimately, the 
Northern District of Illinois, based on the claim construction 
from Virginia, denied the preliminary injunction. 


Both cases arrived at this court on appeal. This court 
heard the cases together and decides them together with 
this decision. 

II. 
The '507 patent has five claims, all of which Abbott asserts 
against Lupin as well as Sandoz and Teva. Claim 1 
claims crystalline cefdinir, using its chemical name, and 
defining its unique characteristics with powder X-ray 
diffraction (PXRD) angle peaks: 
1. Crystalline 7-[2-(2-a minothiazol4-
yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem.4-
carboxylic acid (syn isomer) which shows the peaks 
at the diffraction angles shown in the following table 
in its powder X-ray diffraction pattern: 
diffraction angle (°) 

about 14.7° 
about 17.8° 
about 21.5° 
about 22.0°

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

about 28.1° 

'507 patent, col.16 ll.13-27. In contrast, claims 2-5 
claim crystalline cefdinir, without any PXRD peak limitations, 
but with descriptions of processes used to obtain 
the crystalline cefdinir. Claims 2 and 5 are independent: 


2. Crystalline 7-[2-(2-a minothiazol4-
yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido] 3-
vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (syn isomer) 
which is obtainable by acidifying a solution containing 
7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido 
]-3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (syn isomer) at 
room temperature or under warming. 
5. Crystalline 
7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido 
]-3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (syn isomer) 
which is obtainable by dissolving 
7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2 -
hydroxyiminoacetam


ido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (syn isomer) 
in an alcohol, continuing to stir the solution slowly 
under warming, then cooling the solution to room 
temperature and allowing the solution to stand. 

Id. at col. 16 ll.29-34, 43-50. 

These claims use PXRD as a way to claim the 
structure and characteristics of the unique crystalline 
form. PXRD is a method for identifying and distinguishing 
different crystalline compounds. The method 
beams X-rays toward a powdered chemical. The method 
then measures the ways the rays reflect or bend upon 
contact with the chemical. The diffraction angles *1287 
and intensities vary with the type and purity of the test 
compound. A graph then plots the diffraction angle on 
one axis and the intensity on another. These graphs 
yield a unique “fingerprint” for each crystalline form of 
a chemical. A more sensitive form of X-ray diffraction 
is single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). As this 
name suggests, this method uses only a single crystal as 
a sample. SCXRD does not detect intensity, but produces 
a more precise diffraction angle measurement. 

The '507 patent was not the first cefdinir patent. 
Rather, Astellas' prior art U.S. Patent No. 4,559,334 
(the '334 patent) describes the discovery of cefdinir as a 
compound demonstrating high antimicrobial activity. ' 
334 patent, col. 11 ll.18-24. The '334 patent expired on 
May 6, 2007. 

The '507 patent claims priority to Japanese Patent 
Application No. 62-206199 (the JP '199 application), 
which claimed two crystalline forms of cefdinir, 
“Crystal A” and “Crystal B.” The JP '199 application 
claimed Crystals A and B very specifically, defining 
Crystal A by three infrared (IR)-absorption wavelengths 
and sixteen PXRD angles and intensities. In contrast, 
Crystal B featured five IR-absorption wavelengths and 
twenty-one PXRD angles/intensities. 

Despite using the JP '199 application for priority, 
the '507 patent's specification differs significantly. Specifically, 
Abbott (actually Fujisawa Pharmaceutical 
Co., Ltd., Astellas' predecessor in interest) jettisoned 
the Crystal B disclosure found in the JP '199 application 
and crafted broader claims in its prosecution of the '507 
patent. Because the JP '199 applications defines Crystal 
A and Crystal B physiochemically rather than structurally, 
the forms actually represent subgenuses of crystalline 
cefdinir. Thus Crystals A and B comprise crystalline 
forms of varying structures, which in the context of 
this case means varying levels of hydration. 

The Eastern District of Virginia construed the claim 
terms “crystalline,” “shows,” “peaks,” and “about” as 
follows: 

1) “crystalline” means “Crystal A as outlined in the 
specification”; 

2) “shows” requires the display of a powder X-ray 
diffraction pattern which demonstrates the existence 
of the relevant peaks to a scientifically acceptable degree 
of certainty either visually or by other appropriate 
means of data display; 

3) “peaks” is the plural of “peak;” a “peak exists at a 
powder X-ray diffraction angle that corresponds to an

intensity measurement greater than measurements attributable 
to “noise” if that angle is immediately preceded 
by and followed by powder X-ray diffraction 
angle with a lower intensity measurement; “noise” 
refers to those portions of a PXRD pattern produced 
by intrinsic measurement error, and which cannot be 
associated with a scientifically significant quantity of 
the material which is the subject of the PXRD test; 

4) “about” encompasses measurement errors inherently 
associated with powder X-ray diffraction testing. 


Lupin CC Order, 484 F.Supp.2d at 459, 466. The 
Eastern District of Virginia also concluded that claims 
2-5 were product-by-process claims. Id. Later the district 
court concluded that the process terms of claims 
2-5, indicated by the phrase “obtainable by,” limit the 
claims to the specified processes and process steps. In 
reaching that conclusion, the trial court followed this 
court's opinion in Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex 
Corp., 970 F.2d 834 (Fed.Cir.1992). Lupin SJ Order, 
491 F.Supp.2d at 567-68; Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Labs., 
No. 3:06-CV-400 (E.D.Va. May 10, 2007) (Lupin PbyP 
Order ). In the Lupin appeal, Abbott challenges only 
*1288 the Eastern District of Virginia's constructions of 
“crystalline” and “obtainable by.” 

III. 
Evaluation of a summary judgment of noninfringement 
requires two steps: claim construction, which this 
court reviews without deference, Cybor Corp. v. FAS 
Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1998) 
(en banc), and comparison of the properly construed 
claims to the accused product, process, or composition 
of matter, which in the context of summary judgment 
also occurs without deference, see Ormco Corp. v. 
Align Technology, Inc., 498 F.3d 1307, 1312 
(Fed.Cir.2007). Although infringement by equivalency 
is a question of fact, this court may affirm summary 
judgment “where no reasonable fact finder could find 
equivalence.” Sage Prods., Inc. v. Devon Indus., Inc., 
126 F.3d 1420, 1423 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citing Warner-
Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 
17, 39 n. 8, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997)). 

A. Claim Construction 
[1] Because the claims define the patent right, see 
Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Systems, 
Inc., 381 F.3d 1111, 1115 (Fed.Cir.2004), naturally 
“the claims themselves provide substantial guidance 
as to the meaning of particular claim terms.” Phillips 
v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2005) 
(en banc). But the claims “must be read in view of the 
specification, of which they are a part.” Markman v. 
Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 979 
(Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 
1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996). A patent's specification 
provides necessary context for understanding the 
claims, and “is always highly relevant to the claim construction 
analysis.” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 (quoting 
Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 
1582 (Fed.Cir.1996)). While equally true in a general 
sense, sometimes the specification offers practically incontrovertible 
directions about claim meaning. For example, 
inventors may act as their own lexicographers 
and give a specialized definition of claim terms. See id. 
at 1316. Likewise, inventors and applicants may intentionally 
disclaim, or disavow, subject matter that would 
otherwise fall within the scope of the claim. See id. 

[2][3][4][5] When consulting the specification to 
clarify the meaning of claim terms, courts must take 
care not to import limitations into the claims from the 
specification. This court has recognized the “fine line 
between” the encouraged and the prohibited use of the 
specification. Comark Commc'ns, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 
156 F.3d 1182, 1186 (Fed.Cir.1998). When the specification 
describes a single embodiment to enable the invention, 
this court will not limit broader claim language 
to that single application “unless the patentee has 
demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope 
using ‘words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.’ 
” Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 
F.3d 898, 906 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting Teleflex, Inc. v. 
Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1327 
(Fed.Cir.2002)). By the same token, the claims cannot 
“enlarge what is patented beyond what the inventor has 
described as the invention.” Biogen, Inc. v. Berlex 
Labs., Inc., 318 F.3d 1132, 1140 (Fed.Cir.2003) 
(quoting Netword, LLC v. Centraal Corp., 242 F.3d

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

1347, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2001)). Thus this court may reach a 
narrower construction, limited to the embodiment(s) 
disclosed in the specification, when the claims themselves, 
the specification, or the prosecution history 
clearly indicate that the invention encompasses no more 
than that confined structure or method. See Liebel-
Flarsheim, 358 F.3d at 908. 

[6] Along with the specification, the prosecution 
history is “intrinsic evidence” *1289 of the meaning of 
the claims, because it “provides evidence of how the 
[United States Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) ] and 
the inventor understood the patent.” Phillips, 415 F.3d 
at 1317. Although often producing ambiguities occasioned 
by ongoing negotiations between the inventor 
and the PTO, “the prosecution history can often inform 
the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating 
how the inventor understood the invention and whether 
the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, 
making the claim scope narrower than it 
would otherwise be.” Id. “[C]lear and unmistakable” 
statements during prosecution may also disavow claim 
scope. Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell, Inc., 
519 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting Purdue 
Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms., Inc., 438 F.3d 1123, 
1136 (Fed.Cir.2006)). Again owing in part to the inherent 
ambiguities of prosecution history, the doctrine of 
prosecution disclaimer only applies to unambiguous disavowals. 
See id. at 1375. 
1. “crystalline” 
The Eastern District of Virginia's construction of 
“crystalline” in claims 1-5 as “Crystal A” included the 
important caveat “as outlined in the specification.” 
Lupin CC Order, 484 F.Supp.2d at 459. Although the 
Eastern District noted the parties agreed that 
“crystalline” ordinarily means exhibiting “uniformly arranged 
molecules or atoms,” id. at 454, the court relied 
on the language of the claims themselves, the specification, 
and the prosecution history to arrive at the more 
specific meaning recited in the specification. 

[7] The '507 specification states that “Crystal A of 
the compound (I) [cefdinir] shows its distinguishing 
peaks” at the seven particular PXRD angles enumerated 
in claim 1. '507 patent col.1 ll.51-62. Indeed, the phrase 
“Crystal A of the compound (I)” appears throughout the 
written description, and the patent offers the following 
definition: “any crystal of the compound (I) which 
shows substantially the same diffraction pattern [as in 
the table in col.1/claim 1] is identified as Crystal A of 
the compound (I).” Id. at col.1 l.67-col.2 l.2. As the 
Eastern District correctly concluded: 

Had Astellas intended, in the chart found in column 1, 
to distinguish Crystal A from other forms of crystalline 
cefdinir that also fall within the scope of claim 1, 
it would have listed, at a minimum, an eighth peak associated 
only with Crystal A. However, by listing in 
column 1 only the same seven ‘distinguishing’ peaks 
featured in Claim 1, Astellas confirmed that Crystal A 
was synonymous with the invention listed in Claim 1. 

Lupin CC Order, 484 F.Supp.2d at 456-57. The 
problem, within the confines of claim 1, is that defining 
“crystalline” as “Crystal A,” where “Crystal A” incorporates 
the seven PXRD peak limitations, arguably 
renders the remainder of that claim redundant. To distinguish 
the invention, however, the specification refers 
several times to “Crystal A of the compound (I) of the 
present invention,” see, e.g., '507 patent, col.2 ll.15-17, 
and offers no suggestion that the recited processes could 
produce non-Crystal A compounds, even though other 
types of cefdinir crystals, namely Crystal B, were 
known in the art. As noted earlier, the Crystal B formulation 
actually appears in the parent JP '199 application. 
Thus, Abbott knew exactly how to describe and claim 
Crystal B compounds. Knowing of Crystal B, however, 
Abbott chose to claim only the A form in the '507 patent 
. Thus, the trial court properly limited the term 
“crystalline” to “Crystal A.” The trial court's definition 
correctly identifies claim 1's literal scope. 

*1290 Unlike claim 1, claims 2-5 do not recite the 
seven PXRD peaks expressly associated with Crystal A 
in the '507 specification. Nonetheless, the Eastern District 
of Virginia limited “crystalline” to “Crystal A” in 
these claims as well, The trial court gave two reasons 
for this limitation. First, “[t]he process steps detailed in 
those claims [claims 2-5] correspond with the processes 
for making Crystal A disclosed in the specification under 
the heading ‘The Process For Preparing Crystal A of

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

The Compound (I).’ ” Id. at 457 (quoting '507 patent, 
col.2 ll.13-14). Second, the parent JP '199 application 
recited these steps “to distinguish between preparations 
of Crystal A and Crystal B.” Id. (citing JP '199 application, 
col.6 ll.1-25). 

In limiting “crystalline” to “Crystal A” in claims 
1-5, the Eastern District of Virginia did not improperly 
import the preferred embodiment into the claims. Initially, 
Crystal A is the only embodiment described in 
the specification. As discussed above, the specification's 
recitation of Crystal A as its sole embodiment does not 
alone justify the trial court's limitation of claim scope to 
that single disclosed embodiment. See Liebel-
Flarsheim, 358 F.3d at 906 (“[T]his court has expressly 
rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a 
single embodiment, the claims of the patent must be 
construed as being limited to that embodiment.”). In 
this case, however, the rest of the intrinsic evidence, including 
the prosecution history and the priority JP '199 
application, evince a clear intention to limit the '507 
patent to Crystal A as defined by the seven PXRD peaks 
in the specification and in claim 1. 

Initially, the Eastern District of Virginia properly 
considered the JP '199 application as relevant objective 
evidence of the inventor's knowledge at the filing of the 
'507 patent. While statements made during prosecution 
of a foreign counterpart to a U.S. patent application 
have a narrow application to U.S. claim construction, 
Pfizer Inc. v. Ranbaxy Labs. Ltd., 457 F.3d 1284, 1290 
(Fed.Cir.2006), in this case the JP '199 application is 
part of the prosecution history of the '507 patent itself. 
Indeed the '507 patent claims priority from the JP '199 
application. Furthermore, the trial court did not rely on 
attorney argument or amendments during a foreign prosecution 
as in Pfizer, but consulted only the contents of 
the foreign priority application. The JP '199 application 
strongly suggests that the '507 patent intentionally excluded 
Crystal B compounds. As discussed above, the 
JP '199 application establishes unequivocally that Abbott 
knew and could describe both Crystal A and Crystal 
B. Abbott could have retained the disclosure of 
Crystal B to support the broader claims of the '507 patent, 
but instead disclosed and claimed A alone. 

Furthermore, the prosecution history of the '507 
patent shows a clear and intentional disavowal of claim 
scope beyond Crystal A. Co-inventor Takao Takaya, 
who prepared samples according to Examples 14 and 16 
of the prior art ' 334 patent and a sample of “Crystal A 
of the present application,” offered a declaration that 
Crystal A was more stable than the prior art samples 
from the '334 patent. An analytical chemist, Yoshihiko 
Okamato, corroborated this evidence. J.A. 501-04. Beyond 
these declarations, the applicant specifically limited 
the invention to Crystal A: “the method of preparation 
of the crystalline form of the presently claimed compounds 
is not considered the heart of the present invention. 
The crystalline form of the compound represents 
the inventive concept hereof, and it is clear that [the ' 
334 patent] does not anticipate or suggest said crystalline 
form.” J.A. 511 (Response to Office Action of May 
11, 1989, received October 27, 1989, at 6). 

*1291 Given the exclusive focus on Crystal A in 
the specification as well as the prosecution history of 
the '507 patent, the Eastern District of Virginia properly 
limited “crystalline” in claims 1-5 to “Crystal A.” 

2. proper interpretation of product-by process claims
FN1 

FN1. This court, sua sponte, took en banc Section 
III.A.2 before issuing a panel opinion. The 
following judges join this section of the opinion: 
Chief Judge Michel and Judges Rader, 
Bryson, Gajarsa, Linn, Dyk, Prost, and Moore. 
Judges Newman and Lourie dissent in separate 
opinions. Judges Mayer and Lourie join in 
Judge Newman's dissent. Judge Schall did not 
participate as a member of the en banc court. 

This court addresses Part III.A.2 of this opinion en 
banc, which addresses the proper interpretation of 
product-by-process claims in determining infringement. 

Claims 2-5 of the '507 patent begin by reciting a 
product, crystalline cefdinir, and then recite a series of 
steps by which this product is “obtainable.” The Eastern 
District of Virginia correctly categorized claims 2-5 as 
product-by-process claims. On appeal, Abbott argues

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

that the Eastern District erred in construing the process 
steps of claims 2-5 under the rule in Atlantic Thermoplastics, 
970 F.2d at 846-47, that “process terms in 
product-by-process claims serve as limitations in determining 
infringement,” rather than in accordance with 

Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech, 
Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1583 (Fed.Cir.1991) (“[T]he correct 
reading of product-by-process claims is that they 
are not limited to product prepared by the process set 
forth in the claims.”). This court takes this opportunity 
to clarify en banc the scope of product-by-process 
claims by adopting the rule in Atlantic Thermoplastics. 

In Atlantic Thermoplastics, this court considered 
the scope of product-by-process claim 26 in the patent 
at issue: “[t]he molded innersole produced by the method 
of claim 1.” 970 F.2d at 836. The patentee urged that 
competing, indistinguishable innersoles made by a different 
method nonetheless infringed claim 26. Id. at 

838. This court rejected the patentee's position. This 
court in Atlantic Thermoplastics construed productby-
process claims as limited by the process. Id. at 
846-47. 
This rule finds extensive support in Supreme Court 
opinions that have addressed the proper reading of 
product-by-process claims. See Smith v. Goodyear 
Dental Vulcanite Co., 93 U.S. 486, 493, 23 L.Ed. 952 
(1877) (“The process detailed is thereby made as much 
a part of the invention as are the materials of which the 
product is composed.”); Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. 

v. Davis, 102 U.S. 222, 224, 26 L.Ed. 149 (1880) (“[T]o 
constitute infringement of the patent, both the material 
of which the dental plate is made ... and the process of 
constructing the plate ... must be employed.”); Merrill v. 
Yeomans, 94 U.S. 568, 24 L.Ed. 235 (1877); Cochrane 
v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik, 111 U.S. 293, 4 S.Ct. 
455, 28 L.Ed. 433 (1884) ( BASF); The Wood-Paper 
Patent, 23 Wall. 566, 90 U.S. 566, 596, 23 L.Ed. 31 
(1874); Plummer v. Sargent, 120 U.S. 442, 7 S.Ct. 640, 
30 L.Ed. 737 (1887); Gen. Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance 
Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402 
(1938); see also Atl. Thermoplastics, 970 F.2d at 839-42 
(discussing each of these cases). In these cases, the Supreme 
Court consistently noted that process terms that 
define the product in a product-by-process claim serve 
as enforceable limitations. In addition, the binding case 
law of this court's predecessor courts, the United States 
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (see In re 
Hughes, 496 F.2d 1216, 1219 (CCPA 1974) 

(acknowledging that “true product claims” are 
“broader” in scope than product-by-process claims)), 
*1292 and the United States Court of Claims (see Tri-
Wall Containers v. United States, 187 Ct.Cl. 326, 408 
F.2d 748, 751 (1969)), followed the same rule. 

This court's sister circuits also followed the general 
rule that the defining process terms limit productby-
process claims. See, e.g., Hide-Ite Leather v. Fiber 
Prods., 226 F. 34, 36 (1st Cir.1915) (“It is also a well-
recognized rule that, although a product has definite 
characteristics by which it may be identified apart from 
the process, still, if in a claim for the product it is not so 
described, but is set forth in the terms of the process, 
nothing can be held to infringe the claim which is not 
made by the process.”); Paeco, Inc. v. Applied Moldings, 
Inc., 562 F.2d 870, 876 (3d Cir.1977) (“A patent 
granted on a product claim describing one process 
grants no monopoly as to identical products manufactured 
by a different process.”). Indeed, this court itself 
had articulated that rule: “For this reason, even though 
product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by 
the process, determination of patentability is based on 
the product itself.” In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 697 
(Fed.Cir.1985) (emphasis added). 

The Supreme Court has long emphasized the limiting 
requirement of process steps in product-by-process 
claims. In BASF, the Court considered a patent relating 
to artificial alizarine. Specifically, the patent claimed 
“[a]rtificial alizarine, produced from anthracine or its 
derivatives by either of the methods herein described, or 
by any other method which will produce a like result.” 
111 U.S. at 296, 4 S.Ct. 455 (quoting U.S. Patent Reissue 
No. RE 4,321). In turn, the specification generally 
described a method for making artificial alizarine involving 
anthracine or its derivatives. Alizarine had been 
in use for thousands of years as a red textile dye, traditionally 
extracted from madder root. Pure alizarine has 
the chemical formula CHO, but “artificial alizar

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

ines” available in the market at the time of the litigation 
varied from almost completely pure alizarine, to combinations 
of alizarine and anthrapurpurine, to pure purpurine 
containing no alizarine whatsoever. Id. at 
309-10, 4 S.Ct. 455. The defendant's product contained 
approximately sixty percent anthrapurpurine. Thus both 
alizarine and artificial alizarines were known in the prior 
art. The Supreme Court clearly articulated some of 
the scope and validity problems that arise when process 
limitations of product-by-process claims are ignored: 

[The defendant's product] is claimed by the plaintiff 
to be the artificial alizarine described in No. 4,321, 
and to be physically, chemically, and in coloring 
properties similar to that. But what that is is not 
defined in No. 4,321, except that it is the product of 
the process described in No. 4,321. Therefore, unless 
it is shown that the process of No. 4,321 was followed 
to produce the defendant's article, or unless it is 
shown that that article could not be produced by any 
other process, the defendant's article cannot be identified 
as the product of the process of No. 4,321. Nothing 
of the kind is shown. 

*** 

If the words of the claim are to be construed to cover 
all artificial alizarine, whatever its ingredients, produced 
from anthracine or its derivatives by methods 
invented since Graebe and Liebermann invented the 
bromine process, we then have a patent for a product 
or composition of matter which gives no information 
as to how it is to be identified. Every patent for a 
product or composition of matter must identify it so 
that it can be recognized aside from the description of 
the process for making it, or else nothing can be held 
to infringe the *1293 patent which is not made by that 
process. 

Id. at 310, 4 S.Ct. 455 (emphasis added). 

After BASF, the Supreme Court continued to emphasize 
the importance of process steps in evaluating 
the infringement of product-by-process claims. See, 
e.g., Plummer, 120 U.S. at 448, 7 S.Ct. 640 
(“[W]hatever likeness that may appear between the 

product of the process described in the patent and the 
article made by the defendants, their identity is not established 
unless it is shown that they are made by the 
same process.”); Gen. Elec. Co., 304 U.S. at 373, 58 
S.Ct. 899 (“[A] patentee who does not distinguish his 
product from what is old except by reference, express or 
constructive, to the process by which he produced it, 
cannot secure a monopoly on the product by whatever 
means produced.” (footnote omitted)). 

[8] Thus, based on Supreme Court precedent and 
the treatment of product-by-process claims throughout 
the years by the PTO and other binding court decisions, 
this court now restates that “process terms in productby-
process claims serve as limitations in determining 
infringement.” Atl. Thermoplastics, 970 F.2d at 846-47. 
As noted earlier, this holding follows this court's clear 
statement in In re Thorpe that “product by process 
claims are limited by and defined by the process.” 777 
F.2d at 697. 
More recently, the Supreme Court has reiterated the 
broad principle that “[e]ach element contained in a patent 
claim is deemed material to defining the scope of 
the patented invention.” Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 
19, 117 S.Ct. 1040. Although Warner-Jenkinson specifically 
addressed the doctrine of equivalents, this rule 
applies to claim construction overall. As applied to 
product-by-process claims, Warner-Jenkinson thus reinforces 
the basic rule that the process terms limit 
product-by-process claims. To the extent that Scripps 
Clinic is inconsistent with this rule, this court hereby 
expressly overrules Scripps Clinic. 

The dissenting opinions lament the loss of a “right” 
that has never existed in practice or precedent-the right 
to assert a product-by-process claim against a defendant 
who does not practice the express limitations of the 
claim. This court's en banc decision in no way abridges 
an inventor's right to stake claims in product-by-process 
terms. Instead this decision merely restates the rule that 
the defining limitations of a claim-in this case process 
terms-are also the terms that show infringement. 

Thus this court does not question at all whether 
product-by-process claims are legitimate as a matter of

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

form. The legitimacy of this claim form was indeed a 
relevant issue in the nineteenth century when Ex parte 
Painter, 1891 C.D. 200, 200-01 (Comm'r Pat. 1891), 
and some later cases were before the Commissioner of 
Patents. However, this court need not address that 
settled issue. The issue here is only whether such a 
claim is infringed by products made by processes other 
than the one claimed. This court holds that it is not. 

The jurisprudence of the Court of Customs and Patent 
Appeals-a court with virtually no jurisdiction to address 
infringement litigation-can shed little light on the 
enforcement of the only claim limitations that an applicant 
chooses to define the invention. Indeed, this court's 
venerable predecessor expressed its ambivalence towards 
the relevant infringement analysis: 

The policy of the Patent Office in permitting productby-
process type claims to define a patentable product, 
where necessary, has developed with full cognizance 
of the fact that in infringement *1294 suits some 
courts have construed such claims as covering only a 
product made by the particular process set forth in the 
claim and not to the product per se. 

In re Bridgeford, 53 C.C.P.A. 1182, 357 F.2d 679, 
683 n. 5 (1966). The reference to “some courts” in this 
prior citation, as this court notes en banc, includes the 
United States Supreme Court and every circuit court to 
consider the question, including this circuit. See also 
Jon S. Saxe & Julian S. Levitt, Product-by-Process 
Claims and Their Current Status in Chemical Patent 
Office Practice, 42 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 528, 530 (1960) 
(“[P]roduct-by-process claims have met with a most 
strict interpretation in the courts in infringement proceedings.... 
[T]he courts uniformly hold that only a 
product produced by the claim-designated process may 
be held to infringe the claim.”) (citing Gen. Elec. Co., 
304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402 and BASF, 
111 U.S. at 310, 4 S.Ct. 455). 

[9] Product-by-process claims, especially for those 
rare situations when products were difficult or impossible 
to describe, historically presented a concern 
that the Patent Office might deny all product protection 
to such claims. See In re Butler, 17 C.C.P.A. 810, 813, 
37 F.2d 623 (1930) ( “Process claims are valuable, and 
appellant thinks he is entitled to them; but it is submitted 
that he should not be limited to control of the process 
when the article which that process produces is 
new and useful.”). In the modern context, however, if 
an inventor invents a product whose structure is either 
not fully known or too complex to analyze (the subject 
of this case-a product defined by sophisticated PXRD 
technology-suggests that these concerns may no longer 
in reality exist), this court clarifies that the inventor is 
absolutely free to use process steps to define this 
product. The patent will issue subject to the ordinary requirements 
of patentability. The inventor will not be 
denied protection. Because the inventor chose to claim 
the product in terms of its process, however, that definition 
also governs the enforcement of the bounds of the 
patent right. This court cannot simply ignore as verbiage 
the only definition supplied by the inventor. 

This court's rule regarding the proper treatment of 
product-by-process claims in infringement litigation 
carries its own simple logic. Assume a hypothetical 
chemical compound defined by process terms. The inventor 
declines to state any structures or characteristics 
of this compound. The inventor of this compound obtains 
a product-by-process claim: “Compound X, obtained 
by process Y.” Enforcing this claim without reference 
to its defining terms would mean that an alleged 
infringer who produces compound X by process Z is 
still liable for infringement. But how would the courts 
ascertain that the alleged infringer's compound is really 
the same as the patented compound? After all, the patent 
holder has just informed the public and claimed the 
new product solely in terms of a single process. Furthermore, 
what analytical tools can confirm that the alleged 
infringer's compound is in fact infringing, other than a 
comparison of the claimed and accused infringing processes? 
If the basis of infringement is not the similarity 
of process, it can only be similarity of structure or characteristics, 
which the inventor has not disclosed. Why 
also would the courts deny others the right to freely 
practice process Z that may produce a better product in 
a better way? 

In sum, it is both unnecessary and logically un

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

sound to create a rule that the process limitations of a 
product-by-process claim should not be enforced in 
some exceptional instance when the structure of the 
claimed product is unknown and the product can be 
defined only by reference to a process by which it can 
be made. Such a rule would expand the protection of 
*1295 the patent beyond the subject matter that the inventor 
has “particularly point[ed] out and distinctly 
claim[ed]” as his invention, 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6. 

Thus, the Eastern District of Virginia correctly applied 
the rule that the recited process steps limit the 
product-by-process claims 2-5 for any infringement 
analysis. 

3. “obtainable by” 
[10] In this case, Abbott's plain language argument, 
that “ obtainable by” introduces an optional process, 
even if “obtained by” would introduce limiting process 
steps, is also unavailing. The BASF case, an analogous 
situation to this case, controls. As noted above, the Supreme 
Court in BASF considered the following claim 
language: “Artificial alizarine, produced from anthracine 
or its derivatives by either of the methods herein 
described, or by any other method which will produce a 
like result.” 111 U.S. at 296, 4 S.Ct. 455 (emphasis added). 
The patentee argued that even though the defendant 
did not make artificial alizarine by “either of the 
methods herein described,” the claim should capture the 
product because of the “or by another method” language. 
Id. at 309, 4 S.Ct. 455. The Supreme Court refused 
to attach importance to those expansive words: 
“No. 4,321 furnishes no test by which to identify the 
product it covers, except that such product is to be the 
result of the process it describes.” Id. at 305, 4 S.Ct. 
455. Abbott's claims 2-5, like those in BASF and like 
product-by-process claims in general, do not furnish any 
test by which to identify the cefdinir crystals except that 
they are the result of their respectively claimed processes. 
As per BASF, Abbott's claim cannot capture a 
product obtained by or obtainable by processes other 
than those explicitly recited in the claims. 
If this court were to strip the process elements from 
the claims, as Abbott would urge, for infringement purposes, 
there would then be nothing to differentiate inde


pendent claim 2 from independent claim 5. After all, if 
those claims are not bound by the process terms but 
only “define” the basic cefdinir compound, then each of 
the claims recite the same thing, over and over again. 
Though Abbott argues that it merely intends to give 
meaning to the word “obtainable,” it instead seeks to 
have this court render meaningless the explicit process 
limitations that the applicant chose to define its invention. 


The intrinsic evidence in this case further rebuts 
Abbott's contention that its claims are not limited to 
those products actually obtained by the processes recited. 
In column 2 of the '507 patent, under the title 
heading “The Process for Preparing Crystal A of the 
Compound (I),” the patentee used specific language to 
describe the very two processes that are mirrored in 
claims 2 and 5. '507 patent col.2 ll.13-51. This language 
is not open-ended, nor does it constitute a mere description 
of the product by reference to the manner in which 
it can be made, as Abbott argues. By drafting claims 2 
and 5 to incorporate these specific processes, Abbott 
made a conscious choice to place process requirements 
on its claimed product. If Abbott had wanted to obtain 
broader coverage for crystalline cefdinir devoid of any 
process limitations, as it seeks to do here, it could have 
simply done so (if indeed, as it argues, it is really the 
product that is the heart of the invention, not the process). 
But it did not. The crystals of claims 2 and 5 are 
simply not identifiable other than by the processes disclosed 
in column 2. This court must enforce the ways 
and terms that a party chooses to define its invention. 

*1296 The prosecution history also does not support 
Abbott's contention that “obtainable by” offers 
merely an optional set of definitional process conditions. 
During prosecution, Abbott faced obviousness rejections 
based on application claims 6-9, which were 
process claims that mirrored the very process limitations 
of issued claims 2-5. The PTO refused to issue the 
claims until one set of duplicates was cancelled. Abbott's 
action in cancelling claims 6-9 demonstrates its 
acquiescence to the PTO's view that the process elements 
of claims 2-5 are critical parts of those claims. In 
addition, in a response to the PTO's office action, Ab

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

bott chose to differentiate a cited § 103 reference, 
Takaya, on the basis that Abbott's claimed processes are 
different. For these reasons, the applicant's statement in 
the file wrapper that “the method of preparation ... is 
not considered the heart of the present invention” 
should not be afforded undue gravitas. The process limitations 
cannot be haphazardly jettisoned for an infringement 
analysis when they were so important in the 
patentability analysis. 

In sum, a patentee's use of the word “obtainable” 
rather than “obtained by” cannot give it a free pass to 
escape the ambit of the product-by-process claiming 
doctrine. Claims that include such ambiguous language 
should be viewed extremely narrowly. If this court does 
not require, as a precondition for infringement, that an 
accused infringer actually use a recited process, simply 
because of the patentee's choice of the probabilistic suffix 
“able,” the very recitation of that process becomes 
redundant. This would widen the scope of the patentee's 
claims beyond that which is actually invented-a windfall 
to the inventor at the expense of future innovation 
and proper notice to the public of the scope of the 
claimed invention. For all the above reasons, the Eastern 
District of Virginia correctly construed the process 
limitations beginning with “obtainable by” in claims 2-5 
as limiting the asserted claims to products made by 
those process steps. 

B. Summary Judgment 
In the Lupin case, the Eastern District of Virginia 
granted summary judgment of noninfringement of 
claims 2-5, both literal and by equivalents, and of claim 
1 by equivalents. Lupin SJ Order. Literal infringement 
of claim 1, i.e., whether Lupin's generic cefdinir product 
contains any Crystal A, is therefore not a live issue on 
appeal. As for claims 2-5, the Eastern District noted that 
“Abbott and Astellas have conceded that literal infringement 
of Claims 2-5 cannot be established if the 
product-by-process analysis is performed pursuant to 
Atlantic Thermoplastics,” given that “Abbott and Astellas 
have presented no evidence that Lupin is practicing 
the process steps set forth in Claims 2-5.” Lupin SJ Order, 
491 F.Supp.2d at 568. Because the Eastern District 
correctly applied the rule from Atlantic Thermoplastics 

and likewise properly construed the limiting process 
terms in claims 2-5, only infringement by equivalents of 
claims 1-5 remains before this court. 

[11][12] Infringement analysis under the doctrine 
of equivalents proceeds element-by-element; a generalized 
showing of equivalency between the claim as a 
whole and the allegedly infringing product or process is 
not sufficient to show infringement. See Warner-Jenkinson, 
520 U.S. at 29, 117 S.Ct. 1040 (“the doctrine of 
equivalents must be applied to individual elements of 
the claim, not to the invention as a whole”). The 
primary test for equivalency is the 
“function-way-result” or “triple identity” test, whereby 
the patentee may show an equivalent when the accused 
product or process performs substantially the same 
function, in substantially the same way, to achieve substantially 
the same result, as disclosed in the claim. 
*1297 Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., 
339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950). 
But, because “[d]ifferent linguistic frameworks may be 
more suitable to different cases,” Warner-Jenkinson, 
520 U.S. at 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040, the function-way-result 
test is not the only test for equivalency. Equivalency 
may also be proven where the differences between the 
invention as claimed and the accused product or process 
are insubstantial. Hilton Davis Chem. Co. v. Warner-
Jenkinson Co., 62 F.3d 1512, 1517-18 (Fed.Cir.1995) 
(en banc), rev'd on other grounds, 520 U.S. 17, 117 
S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). In no case, 
however, may the doctrine of equivalents ignore the individual 
claim elements. See Warner-Jenkinson, 520 

U.S. at 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040 (requiring “a special vigilance 
against allowing the concept of equivalence to 
eliminate completely any such [individual] elements”). 
Because “crystalline” in claims 1-5 is limited to 
“Crystal A” as defined by the seven PXRD peaks enumerated 
in claim 1 and in the specification of the ' 507 
patent, the doctrine of equivalents cannot capture crystals 
that are not themselves equivalent to Crystal A. In 
turn, the bounds of Crystal A equivalents cannot ignore 
the limits on Crystal A in the '507 patent, which as discussed 
above, includes a conscious decision to distinguish 
Crystal B from the claimed invention. To recall,

the applicant removed Crystal B from the U.S. prosecution 
of the parent JP '199 application. The '507 patent 
indisputably describes and claims Crystal A, and not 
Crystal B. The '507 patent, of course, could have 
claimed the known Crystal B formulation which was 
known to the inventors because it appeared in their priority 
JP '199 application. The applicants chose not to 
claim Crystal B. Thus Crystal B compounds, most relevantly 
cefdinir monohydrate, fall outside the scope, literal 
or equivalent, of claims 1-5 of the '507 patent. 

[13] The parties agree that the “bulk” of Lupin's 
cefdinir product is Crystal B, not Crystal A. The degree 
to which Lupin's product may or may not also contain 
Crystal A is the central inquiry regarding the alleged literal 
infringement of claim 1, which is not part of the 
present appeal. Abbott cannot extend its exclusive right 
in the '507 claims under the doctrine of equivalents to 
embrace known but unclaimed subject matter. In other 
words, Abbott effectively disclaimed Crystal B during 
prosecution of the '507 patent, by removing the Crystal 
B disclosure from the parent JP '199 application and 
emphasizing the sole teaching of Crystal A in communications 
with the PTO as well as in the '507 specification 
itself. Abbott cannot now recapture that unclaimed 
subject matter under the doctrine of equivalents because 
the Eastern District properly interpreted claims 2-5 to 
limit “crystalline” to Crystal A. To expand that claim 
term to embrace Crystal B would ignore the specific 
claim limitations of the '507 patent. 
Alternatively this court notes that this case seems to 
fit within the dedication doctrine that forecloses invocation 
of the doctrine of equivalents. The patent applicant 
clearly knew of the Crystal B forms of the claimed invention 
because it claimed and disclosed them in its Japanese 
priority application. Yet it declined to claim an 
embodiment expressly disclosed in its priority document, 
thus dedicating that embodiment to the public and 
foreclosing any recapture under the doctrine of equivalents. 
See Johnson & Johnston Assocs. v. R.E. Serv. Co., 
285 F.3d 1046, 1054 (Fed.Cir.2002). 

During prosecution, Abbott chose to eschew Crystal 
B and focus exclusively on Crystal A compounds. 
Without a complete record and no arguments about 

validity before this court on appeal, this court cannot 
speculate on the reasons for this *1298 choice. Nonetheless, 
the parties hotly contest whether Example 14, 
which reports obtaining “crystals” not specifically identified 
or described, and/or Example 16 of the '334 patent 
enable cefdinir monohydrate, i.e. Crystal B type crystals. 


[14][15] Beyond the attempt to reinflate the claims 
to encompass Crystal B based on mathematical comparisons 
of the PXRD peak patterns of Crystal A and Crystal 
B, Abbott also asserts that Lupin effectively admitted 
infringement by equivalents when it claimed before 
the Food and Drug Administration that its cefdinir generic 
was a bioequivalent to Abbott's Omnicef product. 
While bioequivalency may be relevant to the function 
prong of the function-way-result test, bioequivalency 
and equivalent infringement are different inquiries. Bioequivalency 
is a regulatory and medical concern aimed 
at establishing that two compounds are effectively the 
same for pharmaceutical purposes. In contrast, equivalency 
for purposes of patent infringement requires an 
element-by-element comparison of the patent claim and 
the accused product, requiring not only equivalent function 
but also equivalent way and result. Different attributes 
of a given product may thus be relevant to bioequivalency 
but not equivalent infringement, and vice versa. 
As the Northern District of Illinois observed in the San-
doz case, “[i]f bioequivalency meant per se infringement, 
no alternative to a patented medicine could ever 
be offered to the public during the life of a patent.” San-
doz PI Order, 486 F.Supp.2d at 776. Thus, while potentially 
relevant, the bioequivalency of an accused 
product with a product produced from the patent at issue 
is not sufficient to establish infringement by equivalents. 


Because Crystal B is not an equivalent of Crystal 
A, the Eastern District of Virginia did not err in granting 
summary judgment of noninfringement of claims 
2-5, both with respect to literal and equivalent infringement, 
and with respect to equivalent infringement of 
claim 1.

Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 
F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2001). A district court may 
enter a preliminary injunction based on its consideration 
of four factors: “(1) the likelihood of the patentee's success 
on the merits; (2) irreparable harm if the injunction 
is not granted; (3) the balance of hardships between the 
parties; and (4) the public interest.” Erico Int'l Corp. v.

(quoting PHG Techs., LLC v. St. John Cos., Inc., 469 
F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2006)). 

Sandoz and Teva's Omnicef generic products, like 
Lupin's, are also at least primarily cefdinir mono-
hydrate, a Crystal B compound. Sandoz PI Order, 486 
F.Supp.2d at 769. Before the Northern District of 
Illinois, the parties to the Sandoz litigation disputed 
whether Sandoz and Teva's products also contained 
small amounts of cefdinir anhydrate, i.e., Crystal A, 
which would fall within the literal scope of claim 1 of 
the '507 patent. Working primarily from the Eastern 
District of Virginia's claim construction, to which the 
parties to the Sandoz litigation agreed would bind their 
litigation as well for purposes of the preliminary injunction 
motion, the Northern District of Illinois denied Abbott's 
motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that 
Abbott was unlikely to prevail on the merits at trial. 

[18] This court detects no abuse of discretion in the 
Northern District of Illinois' preliminary injunction 
denial. As described above, the '507 patent is properly 
construed to exclude Crystal B, both as to *1299 literal 
and equivalent infringement. Thus, this court need not 
delve into the Northern District of Illinois' clarifications 
of the Eastern District of Virginia's claim constructions. 
The Northern District of Illinois succinctly concluded: 
“[w]e know that Crystal B was known to the plaintiffs 
because it had been included in the Japanese '199 patent. 
Thus we conclude that the plaintiffs deliberately excluded 
from the definition of Crystal A, cefdinir mono-
hydrate, which is Crystal B.” Id. at 775. 
As to the alleged presence of small amounts of 
Crystal A in Sandoz and Teva's products, Abbott's evidence 
did not persuade the Northern District of Illinois. 
Id. This court perceives that decision as well within the 

trial court's discretion. As additional support, the Northern 
District observed that there was no evidence that 
any trace amounts of cefdinir anhydrate, i.e. Crystal A, 
in Sandoz and Teva's products “could be a contributing 
factor in the efficacy” and that even “if there is a small 
amount of cefdinir anhydrate in defendants' products, 
we do not conclude that this could cause literal infringement.” 
Id. While these may be misstatements of the law, 
because de minimis infringement can still be infringement, 
see 35 U.S.C. § 271(a); see also SunTiger, Inc. v. 
Sci. Res. Funding Group, 189 F.3d 1327, 1336 
(Fed.Cir.1999) (“If a claim reads merely on a part of an 
accused device, that is enough for infringement.”), this 
court need not reach that issue in a preliminary injunction 
context which affords the trial court broad leeway 
to discern a “likelihood of success.” Likewise the district 
court may have overstated the relevance of efficacy, 
because the '507 patent contains no claim limitations 
relating to efficacy. But these misstatements were 
harmless because they merely formed an alternative 
basis for the Northern District of Illinois' reasonable assessment 
of the evidence proffered by Abbott for its 
preliminary injunction motion. As noted, this court sustains 
the trial court's discretion based primarily on its 
administration of the proper claim construction and its 
finding that Abbott was not likely to show Sandoz and 
Teva's products contained any Crystal A at all. 

CONCLUSION 

The Eastern District of Virginia correctly construed 
the '507 patent's recitation of “crystalline” in each of the 
asserted claims as limited to Crystal A, as outlined in 
the specification. Because Abbott scrubbed all references 
to Crystal B in the '507 patent's specification, 
which were present in the '507 patent's parent foreign 
application, Abbott clearly demonstrated its intent to 
limit the '507 patent to Crystal A. This intent was further 
underscored by comments made during prosecution. 
As such, Abbott is unable to recapture Crystal B 
through broad claim language or under the doctrine of 
equivalents. The Eastern District of Virginia therefore 
properly concluded on summary judgment that Lupin's 
cefdinir product did not infringe claims 1-5 literally or 
claims 2-5 by equivalency. Similarly, the Northern District 
of Illinois did not abuse its discretion in declining

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges 
MAYER and LOURIE join, dissenting from en banc 
Section III.A.2. 

The court today acts en banc to overturn a century 
of precedent and practice, and holds that a new product 
that is difficult to describe without reference to how it 
was made, but that is nonetheless a new and unobvious 
product, cannot be protected as *1300 a product if its 
description is aided by reference to how it was made. 
Heretofore a new product whose structure was not fully 
known or not readily described could be patented as a 
product by including in the product description sufficient 
reference to how it can be made, to distinguish the 
new product from prior art products. Patentability was 
determined as a product, independent of any process 
reference in the claim, and validity and infringement 
were based on the product itself. This expedient for patenting 
products whose structure was not fully known at 
the time of filing the patent application has been called 
the “rule of necessity.” It was pragmatic, fair, and just, 
for it attuned patent law and practice to the realities of 
invention. 

Today the court rejects this expedient and discards 
this practice, ruling that all claims containing a process 
term under the rule of necessity now must be construed, 
for purposes of infringement, as limited to use of any 
process term that was used to assist in defining the 
product. That is, such a product is not patented as a 
product, however it is produced, but is limited to the 
process by which it was obtained. This is a new restraint 
on patents for new products, particularly today's complex 
chemical and biological products whose structure 
may be difficult to analyze with precision. It is a change 
of law with unknown consequences for patent-based innovation. 


The court acts sua sponte, without explanation of 

what policy is intended to be served by this change, 
without consideration of the technologies that may be 
adversely affected by elimination of this expedient, 
without notice to those whose property rights may be 
diminished. In so doing, the court departs from statute, 
precedent, and practice. This change is as unnecessary 
as it is flawed, gratuitously affecting inventions past, 
present, and future. I respectfully dissent. 

DISCUSSION 

For most product inventions, the process by which 
the product was made, whether or not the process is itself 
a patentable invention, is not stated in the product 
claims. However, as the variety and complexity of invention 
and technology have increased, various forms 
of product claims with process terms have been used in 
specific circumstances, depending on the nature of the 

FN1

invention.The form here at issue relates to product 
claims for new and unobvious products whose structure 
is not fully known, and for which process parameters 
are used to aid in defining the product. This claiming 
expedient has been recognized since at least 1891. 

FN1. As discussed by Eric P. Mirabel, 

Product-By-Process Claims: A Practical Per


spective, 68 J. Pat. & Trademark Off. Soc'y 3, 

3-4 (1986), the various forms of product


by-process claims include “true” product


by-process claims, product claims with a pro


cess limitation, product claims with a process-

derived structural element, and product claims 

with functional terms. 

The court today overturns this expedient for all circumstances, 
brooking no exception. Acting en banc for 
the purpose, the court rules that if any process term or 
descriptive aspect is included in a product claim to aid 
in distinguishing a new product, the claim cannot be infringed 
by the identical product unless the same process 
aspect is used in making the accused product. The court 
holds that it is irrelevant whether the product is new or 
was known, irrelevant whether the product could have 
been fully described by its structure at the time of the 
patent application, irrelevant whether the particular invention 
is a new product or is actually a process. The 
court adopts a simplistic universal rule, *1301 thereby

targeting a small but significant class of inventions. The 
effect of this decision on innovation in complex fields 
of science and technology is unknown to the court, for 
we have had no advice on the consequences of this 
change of law. My dissent is directed as much to the 
court's procedure, as to the substance of the court's decision. 


I 

PROCEDURE 

The court has given no notice of this impending en 
banc action, contrary to the Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure and contrary to the Federal Circuit's own operating 
procedures. The en banc court has received no 
briefing and held no argument, although the Federal 
Rules so require. The communities of inventors, innovators, 
and the public who may be affected by this 
change of law have had no opportunity to be heard. The 
court has received no information concerning the effect 
on patents that were granted based on this long-
established practice, no advice on what kinds of inventions 
may now lie fallow because they are unprotected. 
Nor does the court explain its suspension of the standards 
of judicial process. 

The Federal Rules have the force of law. 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2072. Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 34 and 35 
are here implicated. Rule 34 provides that “oral argument 
must be allowed in every case” unless certain specific 
exceptions exist: 

Rule 34(a)(2) Standards. Oral argument must be allowed 
in every case unless a panel of three judges 
who have examined the briefs and record unanimously 
agrees that oral argument is unnecessary for any 
of the following reasons: 

(A) the appeal is frivolous; 
(B) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively 
decided; or 
(C) the facts and legal arguments are adequately 
presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional 
process would not be significantly aided by oral 
argument. 
Applying the Rule 34 standards, it is clear that (A) 
this appeal is not frivolous and (B) the dispositive issue 
has not been authoritatively decided, for it is currently 
being addressed en banc. There has been (C) no briefing 
and no record to the court, and this is not a case in 
which the decisional process would not be aided by oral 
argument. The en banc court has heard no argument, 
and has received neither written nor oral exploration of 
the diverse aspects of this long-established claiming 
practice. 

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35 has also 
failed of compliance. That rule recognizes the exceptional 
nature of en banc hearing or rehearing, and identifies 
the two circumstances warranting such procedure: 

Rule 35(a)... An en banc hearing or rehearing is not 
favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless: 

(1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or 
maintain uniformity of the court's decisions; or 
(2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional 
importance. 
When an en banc hearing or rehearing is ordered 
sua sponte by the court, whether for uniformity of decision 
or on a question of exceptional importance, the 
hearing or rehearing must receive the appellate process 
set by the Rules. 

I agree that en banc review is appropriate, for this 
apparent conflict in our precedent has existed since 
1992. Now that the court has undertaken to resolve the 
conflict, the withholding of public notice, or even notice 
to the parties to this case, is devoid of justification. The 
question is of importance, but there has been no assertion*
1302 of urgency sufficient to require bypassing the 
standard appellate procedures. The breadth of the en 
banc court's ruling, the solidity of the precedent now 
overruled, the importance of the technologies affected, 
and the untold issued patents that are now placed in 
limbo, require this court's compliance with Federal 
Rules 34 and 35. 

The Federal Circuit has recognized that it can benefit 
from the advice of those knowledgeable in the law

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

and its purposes, in the areas of our nation-wide responsibility. 
Patent law has a direct impact on innovation, 
industry, and technological advance, and when an 
en banc ruling may change the law affecting some areas 
of technology and the industries based thereon, this 
court has routinely sought to be informed, by the parties 
and amici curiae, of relevant concerns. When the impact 
of a sua sponte change of law transcends the interests 
of the parties to the specific case, notice to the 
interested public, as well as to the parties, is fundamental 
to due and fair process. The Federal Circuit's Internal 
Operating Procedure (IOP) 14 was adopted to implement 
these principles: 

IOP 14.3(c) If the sua sponte petition for hearing en 
banc is granted, a committee of judges appointed by 
the chief judge, which shall normally include the 
judge who initiated the poll, shall within seven working 
days (fourteen working days between June 21 and 
September 11) transmit on a vote sheet to the judges 
who will sit en banc an order setting forth the questions 
proposed to be addressed by the court en banc. 
The clerk shall provide notice that a majority of the 
judges in regular service has acted under 28 U.S.C. § 
46 and Fed. R.App. P. 35(a) to order the appeal to be 
heard en banc, and indicate any questions the court 
may wish the parties and amici to address. Notice 
shall be given that the court en banc shall consist of 
all circuit judges in regular service who are not recused 
or disqualified. Additional briefing and oral argument 
will be ordered as appropriate. 

United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 
Internal Operating Procedures at 40, available at 
http:// www. cafc. uscourts. gov/ pdf/ IOPs 122006. pdf. 
This IOP has not been followed. No notice was given, 
even to the parties, that the court had ordered this question 
to be reheard en banc; nor did the court advise the 
parties or the public as to the aspects being addressed 
for en banc decision. The court is acting sua sponte, 
without notice and without argument and without an opportunity 
for participation. By bypassing this court's 
standard operating procedure, as well as violating the 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court has deprived 
itself of input concerning the experience of pre


cedent, of advice as to how this change of law may affect 
future innovation, and of guidance as to the effect 
on existing property rights. 

II 

PRECEDENT AND PRACTICE 

The court's opinion does not mention the long-
established precedent that it is overturning. This is not a 
simple conflict between isolated rulings of the Federal 
Circuit; it is a change of law and practice with roots in 
century-old decisions. I start with this precedent, for the 
expedient of what came to be called the “rule of necessity” 
originated in the recognition, by the courts and the 
Patent Office, that not all new products could be fully 
described by their structure, due to the state of scientific 
knowledge or available analytical techniques. It was 
also recognized, over a century ago, that sufficient distinction 
from prior art products could sometimes be 
achieved by reference to how the product was made. 
Thus the courts and patent administrators established 
the exception *1303 that permitted inclusion in a 
product claim of sufficient recitation of how the product 
was made, to aid in identifying the product and distinguishing 
it from the prior art. This claim form was 
loosely called a “product-by-process” form, although 
that term includes a variety of situations, see n. 1 supra, 
having diverse legal consequences. The only form here 
at issue is that in which the product is new and its structure 
is not fully or readily known, such that its definition 
as a product is aided by referring to how it was 
made. Since before 1891, this has been an accepted way 
to claim products as products, recognizing that this is an 
exception to the general rule that new products are 
claimed without reference to the process by which they 
are produced. 

This exception was discussed in 1891 in Ex parte 
Painter, the Commissioner of Patents explaining that 
when there is entitlement to a patent on a new article of 
manufacture, it can be claimed by reference to the process 
of producing it, when the inventor lacks other language 
to “define and discriminate” the invention: 

It requires no argument to establish the proposition 
that as a rule a claim for an article of manufacture 
should not be defined by the process of producing

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 21 

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

that article. On the other hand, when a man has made 
an invention his right to a patent for it, or his right to 
a claim properly defining it, is not to be determined 
by the limitations of the English language. When the 
case arises that an article of manufacture is a new 
thing, a useful thing, and embodies invention, and 
that article cannot be properly defined and discriminated 
from prior art otherwise than by reference to the 
process of producing it, a case is presented which 
constitutes an exception to the rule. 

1891 C.D. 200, 200-01 (Comm'r Pat. 1891). The 
Commissioner cited, as an earlier example of this exception, 
the claim in Globe Nail Co. v. U.S. Horse Nail 
Co., 19 F. 819 (C.C.D.Mass.1884) (sustaining validity 
of claim directed to horse-shoe nail claimed by reference 
to its process of manufacture, and finding it infringed 
by the accused nail having only a “trivial and 
unsubstantial variation” from the claimed product). In 
contrast, where the patent application made clear that 
the product could be described by its structure, the Patent 
Office ruled that the exception did not apply. See, 
e.g., Ex parte Scheckner, 1903 C.D. 315, 315-16 
(Comm'r Pat.1903) (sustaining rejection of claim directed 
to an etched printing-plate that “specifies certain 
steps by means of which the etching is accomplished” 
because other claims “define the plate in terms of its 
structure”). 

This expedient has been discussed in various judicial 
decisions. In all cases the issue has not been whether 
this expedient was available, for its availability was 
not challenged; the issue was simply its application to 
the particular facts. For example, at a time when it 
heard direct appeals from Patent Office rulings, the 

D.C. Circuit remarked on this “only exception” to the 
general rule of product claiming, stating: 
It is a well-settled rule of patent law that claims for a 
product which is defined by the process of producing 
it will not be allowed; and the only exception to this 
rule seems to be in cases where the product involves 
invention and cannot be defined except by the process 
used in its creation. In extreme cases of this character, 
the product may be allowed; but that is not this 
case, especially in view of the broad claims allowed 

appellant in his copending application.... 

In re Brown, 29 F.2d 873, 874 (D.C.Cir.1928) 

(emphasis added). 

The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals discussed 
precedent involving claims *1304 for processes 
and products in various factual situations, and summarized 
that: 

Where it is possible to define a product by its characteristics, 
the practice is clearly settled that this should 
be done. Where, however, the product is novel and involves 
invention and cannot be defined except by the 
steps of the process involved in its creation, there are 
cases holding that such a claim may be allowed, and 
it has been sustained by a Court. 

In re Butler, 17 C.C.P.A. 810, 37 F.2d 623, 626 
(1930) (emphasis added) (quoting Ex Parte Feisenmeier, 
1922 C.D. 18 (Comm'r Pat.1922)). The CCPA then 
found this rule inapplicable to the facts of Butler's invention, 
explaining that “the record at bar does not meet 
this requirement [that the product was new].” Id. 

In In re Lifton, 38 C.C.P.A. 1119, 189 F.2d 261 
(1951), the CCPA again commented on this exception 
for product claims, stating that when “proper article 
claims” were possible they must be used, with the exception 
of when such claims are “impossible”: 

This court has uniformly held that a claim for an article 
must define the article by its structure and not by 
the process of making it. The one exception to this 
rule, where the invention is the article and it is impossible 
to otherwise define it, is clearly ruled out in 
the present case because appellant has demonstrated 
the possibility of proper article claims by including 
several devoid of process limitations. 

Id. at 263 (emphasis added, citations omitted). The 
court again recognized “the one exception,” holding 
once again that it does not apply when the product can 
be described independently of the process of making it. 

These inquiries into the facts warranting application 
of the exception demonstrate that the rule of necessity

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

was seldom applied, but was nonetheless recognized 
both by the courts and the Patent Office. Decisions of 
the Patent Office Board of Appeals illustrate the practice. 
See, e.g., Ex parte Pfenning, 65 U.S.P.Q. 577 
(Pat.Off.Bd.App.1945) (allowing claim “directed to a 
product which results from the method of claim 9” in 
light of applicant's argument that “it is impossible in the 
instant case to define the product adequately in terms of 
the elements which compose it or in terms of its physical 
characteristics”); Ex parte Lessig, 57 U.S.P.Q. 129 
(Pat.Off.Bd.App.1943) (allowing claim for a “product 
containing vulcanized rubber” strongly adhered to fibers 
which “has been prepared by the process of claim 4” because 
“it is not possible to otherwise distinguish over 
the art of record”). 

Commentators have explained that this claiming 
practice became of increasing importance as the complex 
sciences blossomed. See, e.g., Mark D. Passler, 
Product-by-Process Patent Claims: Majority of the 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Forgets Purpose 
of the Patent Act, 49 U. Miami L.Rev. 233, 233 n. 
3 (1994) (“Such claims are often used by companies to 
patent complex drug or chemical products whose structure 
is not completely understood and, therefore, can 
only be accurately described by the process through 
which it is made.”). It is well known that the full structure 
of some chemical and biological products is not always 
known at the time the patent application is filed. 
Indeed, it is a tenet of the scientific method that explanation 
and theory tend to follow, not precede, the observation 
of a development in the science. 

The CCPA continued to recognize the use of process 
terms to aid in describing new products-the form of 
claim sometimes called a “pure” product-by-process 
claim, see n. 1 supra-and repeatedly ruled that such 
claims are properly viewed *1305 as product, not process, 
claims. The court also disallowed such claims 
where the product itself was not novel and unobvious. 
The court confirmed that such a claim, when justified 
for a novel and unobvious product, is properly construed 
as encompassing the full scope of a product 
claim. For example, in In re Bridgeford, 53 C.C.P.A. 
1182, 357 F.2d 679 (1966), the court again explained 

that a new product may be defined by the process of 
making it if there is no other way to describe the 
product, stressing that “the invention so defined is a 
product and not a process,” id. at 682. The Bridgeford 
court relied on this view of the scope of the productby-
process claims in a related patent, and held unpatentable 
for double patenting claims that defined the 
“product per se.” Id. at 680. The court explained that 
product-by-process claims are true product claims, and 
overruled the suggestion in In re Freeman, 35 C.C.P.A. 
920, 166 F.2d 178, 181 (1948), that product-by-process 
claims are “dependen[t] ... on process limitations” and 
therefore coextensive with process claims. Bridgeford, 
357 F.2d at 683 n. 6 (“While there is some language in 
Freeman to support the contention that a productby-
process type claim differs only ‘in scope’ from a 
process type claim and they therefore ‘are directed to a 
single invention,’ (166 F.2d at 181) so far as this is inconsistent 
with our holding here it must be overruled.”). 

My colleagues misstate the holding of Bridgeford, 
for Bridgeford directly contravenes today's holding. In 
Bridgeford the CCPA noted that “some courts” have 
construed claims with process steps as limited to the recited 
process, id. at 683 n. 5, apparently without inquiring 
whether the rule of necessity justified full product 
scope for the invention at issue. The CCPA's observation 
that patents are construed inconsistently in other 
courts cannot be taken, as apparently do my colleagues, 
as error by the CCPA. To the contrary, the inconsist


FN2

ency among courts led eventually to consolidation. 

FN2. The Hruska Commission Report, which 
informed the debate that eventually led to the 
formation of our court, described the varying 
attitudes towards patents held by the regional 
courts of appeal and the variations in patent 
rulings among the circuits. See Commission on 
Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System 
Structure and Internal Procedures: Recommendations 
for Change, 67 F.R.D. 195, 370 
(1975). 

Again in In re Brown, 59 C.C.P.A. 1036, 459 F.2d 
531 (1972), the CCPA explained that productby-
process claims are product claims, not process

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

claims, and that the patentability of the product must be 
established independently of the process by which it is 
identified. See id. at 535 (“[I]n spite of the fact that the 
claim may recite only process limitations, it is the patentability 
of the product claimed and not of the recited 
process steps which must be established.”). 

Other decisions discussing application of this expedient 
to claims directed to complex new products include 
In re Pilkington, 56 C.C.P.A. 1237, 411 F.2d 
1345, 1349 (1969) (“While we are satisfied that the references 
of record do not anticipate appellant's glass or 
demonstrate that it would be obvious, the differences 
between that glass and the glass of the prior art do not 
appear to us to be particularly susceptible to definition 
by the conventional recitation of properties or structure.”), 
and In re Fessmann, 489 F.2d 742, 743 (CCPA 
1974) (affirming obviousness rejection of productby-
process claim directed to a “liquid smoke” product, 
but observing that prior art compositions “are complex 
mixtures of the chemical compounds which can be derived 
from wood” which “defy simple characterization 
and this fact presumably accounts for the use of 
product-by-process *1306 claims”). The need for this 
expedient, and the proper scope afforded such claims, is 
summarized in the treatise Walker on Patents: 

[P]atent rights over a chemical product are typically 
independent of the process by which the product is 
made, and are particularly valuable because of this 
fact. This independence is normally accomplished by 
defining the product in terms of its structural features 
alone, with no reference in the claims to process steps 
whatsoever. The state of chemical technology, 
however, is sometimes too limited for a structural description 
of this type to be made. The structure of 
some chemicals, especially those including elaborate 
polymer chains, cannot be accurately determined. The 
same chemicals, however, may be both economically 
valuable and technologically reproducible, in the 
sense that they can be reliably made by subjecting a 
particular set of raw materials to a particular set of 
process steps. 

*** 

The law reacted to these difficulties by making it 
easier to obtain traditional product protection over 
this special class of chemicals. The inventor was allowed 
to describe such a chemical in terms of how 
one gained possession of it, that is, by way of the process 
steps by which it was made. Once he did so, the 
law preserved to the inventor the fullest measure of 
product-only protection that it could; it treated the 
process recitations as proxies for the direct recitations 
of structure that could not be made. Such a 
claim was therefore equivalent to one stated in terms 
of structure only. It would broadly dominate all methods 
by which the chemical could be made or used. At 
the same time, it carried the same dangers of running 
afoul of the art: it would be anticipated if the chemical 
had been produced previously, even if by a method 
other than what the inventor disclosed. 

1 Moy's Walker on Patents § 4:74 (4th ed.2008) 
(emphases added). 

The en banc court appears to misunderstand this 
precedent, for my colleagues now state that “binding 
case law” of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals 
and the Court of Claims mandates a single rule for all 
claims that contain any process terms, whether the 
product is novel or known, citing In re Hughes, 496 
F.2d 1216 (CCPA 1974), for this proposition. However, 
Hughes does not state this proposition; Hughes stands 
for the contrary proposition. In Hughes the question was 
the patentability of claims directed to “shakes” as are 
used in roofing, as follows: 

12. Shakes manufactured from a shake bolt by the 
process of making a plurality of cuts into and across 
the shake bolt to an extent to establish predetermined 
tip lengths, and splitting the weather end portions of 
the shakes from the bolt by starting the splits at the 
inner ends of the cuts and continuing the splits to the 
end of the bolt. 
This claim had been rejected as an improper 
product-by-process claim, on the ground that the 
product could be described without including process 
steps. The Hughes court acknowledged the general rule 
against product-by-process claiming, but also explained

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

the “proper exception to the general rule” as first set 

forth in Painter, as follows: 
[T]he Commissioner of Patents enunciated the general 
rule that a product should not be defined in terms 
of the process of making it. In Painter, a proper exception 
to the general rule was found on the ground 
that the product could not be properly defined and 
discriminated from the prior art otherwise than by reference 
to the process of producing it. This basic rule 
and the exception*1307 have been recognized and 
followed continuously by the Patent Office and the 
Courts. 

Hughes, 496 F.2d at 1218 (quoting approvingly the 
Solicitor's argument). The court reaffirmed that “in spite 
of the fact that a product-by-process claim may recite 
only process limitations, ‘it is the product which is 
covered by the claim and not the recited process steps.’ 
” Id. Contrary to my colleagues' statement, Hughes did 
not eliminate this form of claim, or change its role as a 
product claim. Indeed, the Hughes court applied the exception 
and reversed the Board's rejection of a productby-
process claim, stating: 

We agree with appellant that the [general] rule should 
not be applied to the situation before us. We have 
been shown no true product claim which describes 
appellant's invention, in the words of the solicitor, “in 
terms of structure or physical characteristics.” When 
an applicant seeks to describe his invention by a 
product-by-process claim because he finds that his invention 
is incapable of description solely by structure 
or physical characteristics, it is incumbent upon the 
Patent Office to indicate where, or how, the applicant's 
invention is, or may be, so described. 

Id. at 1219. My colleagues could hardly have selected 
less apt support for their construction of productby-
process claims, for Hughes explicitly states that such 
claims are for the product, not the process. 

In addition to misstating precedent of the CCPA, 
the en banc court also mischaracterizes the decisions of 
our predecessor the Court of Claims, stating that the 
Court of Claims' decisions support today's ruling. The 
court cites Tri-Wall Containers v. United States, 187 
Ct.Cl. 326, 408 F.2d 748 (1969), for this purpose. That 

citation, too, is mysterious, for in Tri-Wall Containers 
the court found that the claimed product was not “new” 
because it had been on sale for more than the permitted 
period, although the product that was on sale had been 
made by a different process than the process stated in 
the claim. The Court of Claims stated that the evidence 
showed that “the prior art product and the claimed 
product are structurally identical,” id. at 751, and explained 
that a known product cannot be patented by including 
process terms in the claim: 

It is well established that a product claimed as made 
by a new process is not patentable unless the product 
itself is new. The Wood-Paper Patent, 90 U.S. (23 
Wall.) 566, 596, 23 L.Ed. 31 (1874), Cochrane v. 
Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik [“BASF”], 111 U.S. 
293, 311, 4 S.Ct. 455, 28 L.Ed. 433 (1984).... 

.... 

More recent cases point out that the addition of a 
method step in a product claim, which product is not 
patentably distinguishable from the prior art, cannot 
impart patentability to the old product. Jungersen v. 
Baden, 69 F.Supp. 922, 928 (S.D.N.Y.1947), aff'd, 
166 F.2d 807 (2d Cir.1948), aff'd, 335 U.S. 560, 69 
S.Ct. 269, 93 L.Ed. 235 (1949); In re Stephens, 345 
F.2d 1020, 1023, 52 C.C.P.A. 1409 (1965). 

Tri-Wall Containers, 408 F.2d at 750-51. This case 
applied the standard rule that old products cannot be 
patented-it contains no statement limiting the scope of 
claims that include process aspects to aid in describing 
new products. The Supreme Court cases cited in Tri-
Wall are all directed to new processes for making old 
products-these are the same cases that the en banc court 
today incorrectly applies to new products, as I discuss 

post. 

Contrary to my colleagues' statement, CCPA and 
Court of Claims precedent do not support today's en 
banc thesis. Our predecessor courts understood the 
complexity of patenting, and the CCPA consistently 
*1308 implemented the expedient whereby process 
terms contributed to the description of complex new 
products of incompletely known structure. These courts

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

recognized the independence of product claims for new 
products, and did not limit such claims to the specific 
process steps that were used to aid in describing the 

FN3

product. 

FN3. The en banc court impugns the CCPA's 
experience. Maj. op. at 1293 (stating that the 
CCPA had “virtually no jurisdiction to address 
infringement litigation”). The CCPA for many 
years addressed infringement litigation, in appeals 
from the International Trade Commission 
and its predecessor tribunals. E.g., Sealed Air 
Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 68 C.C.P.A. 93, 
645 F.2d 976 (1981) (issues of validity and infringement); 
Hale Fire Pump Co. v. Tokai, 
Ltd., 67 C.C.P.A. 121, 614 F.2d 1278 (1980) 
(issues of validity, scope, and infringement); In 
re Orion, 22 C.C.P.A. 149, 71 F.2d 458 (1934) 

(issues of jurisdiction and infringement). 

Our predecessor's legal and scholarly distinction 
in the field of patent law, and the high 
regard in which Congress and the innovation 
communities held the jurisprudence of the 
CCPA were a critical foundation for formation 
of the Federal Circuit and its charge to 
reinvigorate the role of the patent system in 
service to the nation's technological innovation. 
See 125 Cong. Rec. 23,462 (1979) 
(statement of Sen. DeConcini) (“It is a reflection 
of high esteem which Congress has 
for the sitting judges of the Court of Claims 
and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals 
that these judges will become the first judges 
of the new Court of the Federal Circuit.”). 

With the advent of the Federal Circuit, this court 
continued to apply these principles. In In re Thorpe, 777 
F.2d 695 (Fed.Cir.1985), the court explained that 
product-by-process claims are anticipated when the 
product existed in the prior art, even if the product was 
made by a different process. My colleagues are mistaken 
in stating that Thorpe held that all such claims are 
to be construed as process claims, even when the 
product is new and the rule of necessity justifies this 
mode of describing the invention. In Thorpe the product 

was not new; it was a known color developer for carbonless 
paper copy systems, and this court held that the 
PTO correctly rejected the claim to “the product of the 
process of claim 1,” explaining that since the product 
was old it could not be claimed as a product, whether or 
not process steps are recited in the claim. 

The facts of Thorpe did not concern the exception 
and expedient where process terms are invoked to describe 
a new product of complex structure. This exception 
is rarely invoked. The general rule requiring claims 
to have a process-free definition of the structure of a 
new product accommodates most inventions. Some recent 
exceptions are seen in emerging aspects of biotechnology. 
For example, in Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical 
Co., 706 F.Supp. 94 (D.Mass.1989), aff'd in 
relevant part, 927 F.2d 1200 (Fed.Cir.1991), the district 
court considered the following claim: 

4. A procaryotic or eucaryotic host cell transformed 
or transfected with a DNA sequence according to 
claim 1, 2 or 3 in a manner allowing the host cell to 
express erythropoietin. 
Id. at 108. The district court found claim 4 
“ambiguous,” explaining that while it is directed to a 
new product-this host cell-the words “transformed or 
transfected” appear to invoke a process. The district 
court recognized that “[i]n the traditional patent framework, 
a product is wholly separate and distinct from a 
process.” Id. at 107. The court observed that “[a] 
product patent gives the patentee the right to restrict the 
use and sale of the product regardless of how and by 
whom it was manufactured,” while “[a] process pat-
entee's power extends only to those products made by 
the patented process.” Id. (quoting United States v. 
Studiengesellschaft Kohle, 670 F.2d 1122, 1127-28 
(D.C.Cir.1981)). The district court, affirmed by the 
*1309 Federal Circuit, found this claim to be valid and 
infringed as a product claim, and although many issues 
and arguments were present in this litigation, the applicability 
of the venerable rule of necessity was not at issue.

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

Circuit addressed the interpretation and scope of claims 
exemplified by claim 13: 

13. Highly purified and concentrated VIII:C prepared 
in accordance with the method of claim 1. 
Claim 1 set forth the method referred to in claim 
13, as follows: 

1. An improved method of preparing Factor VIII pro-
coagulant activity protein [VIII:C] comprising the 
steps of 
(a) adsorbing a VIII:C/VIII:RP complex from a 
plasma or commercial concentrate source onto 
particles bound to a monoclonal antibody specific to 
VIII:RP, 
(b) eluting the VIII:C, 
(c) adsorbing the VIII:C obtained in step (b) in another 
adsorption to concentrate and further purify 
same, 
(d) eluting the adsorbed VIII:C, and 
(e) recovering highly purified and concentrated 
VIII:C. 
It was not disputed that the product was a new 
product, that the “highly purified and concentrated” 
blood clotting Factor VIII:C had not previously been 
obtained, and that a complete structural identification of 
Factor VIII:C was not available. The defendant Genentech 
had made its commercial Factor VIII:C not by 
the method set forth in claim 1, but by using a sample of 
the Scripps product to “clone” Factor VIII:C protein using 
recombinant DNA techniques. One question presented 
in the case was whether claims such as claim 13 
were infringed by the same product produced by a different 
method, or whether such claims were infringed 
only if the accused infringer used the process of claim 

1. 
Scripps stressed that its product was novel and enabled 
and was patentable as a product, although the full 
structure of Factor VIII:C was not available at that stage 
of the science. The court addressed whether claims ex


emplified by claim 13, properly construed, were product 
claims, or whether they were limited to the specific processes 
in the process claims to which they referred. This 
court held that the claims were product claims. The 
court held that since claims are construed the same way 
for infringement as for validity, the question was whether 
the Genentech product was the same as the claimed 
product, not whether they were produced by the same 
process. The court remanded to the district court for this 
factual determination. Scripps, 927 F.2d at 1584. 

After Scripps was decided, a panel of this court decided 
an appeal concerning plastic innersoles for shoes. 
In Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 970 
F.2d 834 (Fed.Cir.1992), the claims at issue were represented 
by: 

Claim 24. The product produced by the method of 
claim 1. 

In turn, claim 1 was as follows: 

1. In a method of manufacturing a shock-absorbing, 
molded innersole for insertion in footwear, which 
method comprises: 
(a) introducing an expandable, polyurethane into a 
mold; and 
(b) recovering from the mold an innersole which 
comprises a contoured heel and arch section composed 
of a substantially open-celled polyurethane 
foam material, the improvement which comprises: 
(i) placing an elastomeric insert material into the 
mold, the insert material having greater shock-
absorbing *1310 properties and being less resilient 
than the molded, open-celled polyurethane foam 
material, and the insert material having sufficient 
surface tack to remain in the placed position in the 
mold on the introduction of the expandable polyurethane 
material so as to permit the expandable 
polyurethane material to expand about the insert 
material without displacement of the insert material; 
and 
(ii) recovering a molded innersole with the insert 
material having a tacky surface forming a part of

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

the exposed bottom surface of the recovered innersole. 


The panel held that a claim in the form of claim 24 
always requires use of the referenced method, and that 
it is irrelevant whether the product was new or known. 
The court stated that the rule of necessity, as applied in 
Scripps, is contrary to Supreme Court rulings. The panel 
stated that the decision in Scripps is incorrect. A majority 
of the Federal Circuit declined to resolve the conflict 
en banc, resulting in several further opinions. E.g., Atlantic 
Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 974 F.2d 
1279 (Fed.Cir.1992) (dissents of Chief Judge Nies and 
Judges Rich, Newman, and Lourie from denial of rehearing 
en banc ). Judge Rich wrote: 

[T]his whole excursion was unnecessary because the 
patentee admitted that claim 24, the productby-
process claim, was limited to the process. The 
claim read: “The molded innersole produced by the 
method of claim 1.” There was, therefore, no occasion 
to review the law to determine how the claim should 
be construed.... We are not here to provide restatements 
of the law. Such restatements should not be 
made without an opportunity for all affected parties to 
be heard from. The affected parties here are not the 
vendors of inner soles but largely the entire chemical 
industry, particularly the pharmaceutical manufacturers. 


Id. at 1280 (Rich, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing 
en banc ). 

Most trial courts continued to recognize the rule of 
necessity. For example, in Trustees of Columbia University 
v. Roche Diagnostics GmbH, 126 F.Supp.2d 16 
(D.Mass.2000), the district court considered claims such 
as the following. 

72. A eukaryotic cell into which foreign DNA I has 
been inserted in accordance with the process of claim 
54. 
The court referred to the Scripps/ Atlantic conflict, 
concluded that the earlier panel decision controlled under 
the Federal Circuit's rule, see Newell Companies, 
Inc. v. Kenney Manufacturing Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 

(Fed.Cir.1988) (“This court has adopted the rule that 
prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent 
on subsequent panels unless and until overturned 
in banc.”), and applied the Scripps ruling, holding that 
the new cell was not limited by the process by which it 
was made. 

The PTO also continued to apply the rule of necessity. 
In instructing examiners that products should 
whenever possible be described without reference to 
how they were made, the PTO continued to point out 
the exception that patentability as a product is not foreclosed 
when independent description is not available. 
The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) instructs 
the examiner to consider the structure implied by 
any process steps in the claim: 

The structure implied by the process steps should 
be considered when assessing the patentability of 
product-by-process claims over the prior art, especially 
where the product can only be defined by the 
process steps by which the product is made, or where 
the manufacturing process steps would be expected to 
impart*1311 distinctive structural characteristics to 
the final product. 

MPEP § 2113 (8th ed., July 2008 rev.). This has 
been the practice since at least Ex parte Painter in 1891. 
I am surprised at the en banc court's casual misstatement 
about “the treatment of product-by-process claims 
throughout the years by the PTO,” maj. op. at 1293, for 
the statement is directly contrary to the treatment of 
such claims throughout the years by the PTO. 

The en banc court's insistence that one universal 
rule should now be applied is contrary to the entire 
body of decisional law, including the Supreme Court 
cases cited by my colleagues. As I next discuss, in most 
of the cited cases the product was not a new product and 
thus was not patentable as a product, whether or not any 
process term was included in the claim. The Court consistently 
held that when the product was old and only 
the process was a patentable invention, a claim for the 
“product of that process” could not cover the old 
product made by a different process. That is, and has always 
been, the law. I comment briefly on the Court's

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

cases that my colleagues misinterpret and misapply: 

Cochrane v. BASF 

The en banc opinion relies primarily on Cochrane 

v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik, 111 U.S. 293, 4 S.Ct. 
455, 28 L.Ed. 433 (1884) (“ BASF ”), even though my 
colleagues acknowledge that the product in that case 
was the well-known dye alizarine. The patent before the 
Court was a reissue patent that claimed artificial alizarine 
in the following way: 
Artificial alizarine, produced by either of the methods 
herein described, or by any other method which will 
produce a like result. 

The Court held that since alizarine was a known 

product, the claim was limited to the patentee's two pro


cesses, stating: 
It was an old article. While a new process for producing 
it was patentable, the product itself could not be 
patented, even though it was a product made artificially 
for the first time, in contradistinction from being 
eliminated from the madder root. Calling it artificial 
alizarine did not make it a new composition of 
matter, and patentable as such, by reason of its having 
been prepared, artificially, for the first time, from anthracite, 
if it was set forth as alizarine, a well-known 
substance. Wood-Paper Patent, 23 Wall. 566, 593 [23 
L.Ed. 31 (1874) ]. There was therefore no foundation 
for reissue No. 4,321, for the product, because, on the 
description given, no patent for the product could 
have been taken out originally. 

111 U.S. at 311-12, 4 S.Ct. 455. The Court accord


ingly limited the claim to the two processes described in 

the patent, and in the portion of BASF quoted by my 

colleagues, the Court discussed the proofs needed to 

show infringement: 
[U]nless it is shown that the process of [the specification] 
was followed to produce the defendants' article, 
or unless it is shown that the article could not be produced 
by any other process, the defendants' article 
cannot be identified as the product of the process of 
[the specification]. Nothing of the kind is shown. 

Id. at 310, 4 S.Ct. 455. The Court did not state, or 

imply, despite my colleagues' contrary theory, that a 
claim to a new and complex product that is of necessity 
defined and distinguished by the process by which it 
was made, can never be infringed unless that specific 
process is practiced. There was no issue in BASF of a 
product that could not be defined without reference to 
how it was made. The BASF Court, providing guidance, 
remarked on the importance of independent description 
of a *1312 patented product, in the following sentence 
cited by my colleagues: 

Every patent for a product or composition of matter 

must identify it so that it can be recognized aside 

from the description of the process for making it, or 

else nothing can be held to infringe the patent which 

is not made by that process. 

Id. at 310, 4 S.Ct. 455. This statement is indeed the 
general rule, as stated by the Patent Commissioner several 
years later in Ex parte Painter. However, BASF did 
not present the situation for which the expedient of necessity 
was created, for as the Court stated, the invention 
was “a process for preparing alizarine, not as a new 
substance prepared for the first time, but as the substance 
already known as alizarine, to be prepared, 
however, by the new process, which process is to be the 
subject of the patent, and is the process of preparing the 
known product alizarine from anthracine.” Id. at 
308-09, 4 S.Ct. 455. 

This was not an instance of a new product describable 
only in terms of its process of manufacture. The 
BASF decision lends no support to today's en banc rule 
that every product claim that mentions a process step is 
always restricted to that process, with no exception, no 
expedient, no preservation of the distinctions among 
forms of claim based on the nature of the invention. 

The Goodyear Dental cases 

The en banc court also states that its new ruling is 
supported by two cases relating to a patent on the use of 
vulcanized rubber to form a plate for holding dentures, 
Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., 93 U.S. (3 
Otto) 486, 23 L.Ed. 952 (1876), and Goodyear Dental 
Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U.S. (12 Otto) 222, 26 
L.Ed. 149 (1880). Review of these cases reveals no support 
for the en banc court's statement of their holdings.

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

The claim at issue was: 

The plate of hard rubber or vulcanite, or its equivalent, 
for holding artificial teeth, or teeth and gums, 
substantially as described. 

Davis, 102 U.S. (12 Otto) at 223. The claim was 
written in the then-standard format of incorporating the 
description in the specification through the phrase 
“substantially as described.” This was not a productby-
process or product-of-the-process claim at all, for 
the claim contains no process distinction or limitation, 
but simply refers to the description in the specification. 
Nonetheless, the en banc majority appears to state that 
these cases mean that the Supreme Court requires that 
all claims for products whose method of production is 
set forth in the specification-as is required by the description 
and enablement requirement-cannot be infringed 
unless that method is used. 

That is not what the Goodyear Dental cases said. 
The Court referred to the position of Goodyear Dental 
Vulcanite that its patent covered all dental plates made 
of vulcanized rubber, and held, upon reviewing the specification 
and the prior art, that the process of manufacture 
was what distinguished this dental plate from the 
prior art dental plates, and concluded: “The invention, 
then, is a product or manufacture made in a defined 
manner. It is not a product alone, separated from the 
process by which it is created.” Smith, 93 U.S. (3 Otto) 
at 493. Were the claim not limited to this process, the 
Court concluded that the claim would not have been 
patentable. See id. at 492 (holding that if the patent 
were for a “mere substitution of vulcanite for other materials, 
which had previously been employed as a base 
for artificial sets of teeth” then it “constituted no invention”). 
Four years later, considering the same patent in 
Davis, the Court emphasized*1313 that the claim was 
limited to use of vulcanized rubber or its equivalent, 
and held that since the accused infringer made its dental 
plate with celluloid, there could not be infringement. 
See 102 U.S. (12 Otto) at 228-30. 

The court today cites these cases as definitive of the 
interpretation of claims with process elements, although 
the only process referent is the phrase “substantially as 

described.” This flawed reasoning was disposed of in 
1890 in the classic Robinson on Patents, and until now 
has not reappeared: 

In stating Claims certain phrases are frequently employed 
to which a special importance seems to be attached 
by applicants. Among these are the phrase 
“substantially as described” and others of the same 
meaning. These phrases import the same thing when 
used in a Claim as when elsewhere employed. They 
are neither necessary nor technical. The reference 
they make to the Description is always implied, and 
relates only to the essential features of the invention 
as therein delineated. They add nothing, therefore, to 
the certainty of the Claim, nor do they detract from it 
unless the claimant carelessly inserts them as a substitute 
for a more clear and definite statement of his invention.

Merrill v. Yeomans 

My colleagues also rely on Merrill v. Yeomans, 94 

U.S. (4 Otto) 568, 24 L.Ed. 235 (1877). Again, the relevance 
is remote. The Merrill Court explained that the 
issue was the “correct construction of plaintiff's patent,” 
id. at 569, construing the following claim: 
[T]he above-described new manufacture of the deodorized 
heavy hydrocarbon oils, suitable for lubricating 
and other purposes, free from the characteristic 
odors of hydrocarbon oils, and having a slight smell 
like fatty oil, from hydrocarbon oils, by treating them 
substantially as hereinbefore described. 

Id. at 570. The Court examined the specification to 
determine what was invented, and found that the invention 
was directed solely to a process, not to a product. 
The Court then concluded that the claim's usage “new 
manufacture” referred to the manufacturing process, 
and not to the product. The claim was thus a process 
claim, and no “product-by-process” issue was presented. 
The Court concluded that the defendant's oil, which 
was made by a different process, did not infringe.

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

The Merrill Court discussed its practice of looking 
to the patent application and interpreting the claim in 
light of what was “really invented”: 

[W]here it appears that a valuable invention has really 
been made, this court, giving full effect to all that is 
found in the application on which the Patent Office 
acted, will uphold that which was really invented, and 
which comes within any fair interpretation of the pat-
entee's assertion of claim. 

Id. at 573. This approach is inimical to the en banc 
court's theory that it is irrelevant what the patentee describes 
as his invention, and that if a process step is 
mentioned in the claim or “substantially described” in 
the specification, the claim always requires performance 
of that step. Although the Court in Merrill was not confronted 
with a situation of indescribable product or necessity 
bred of complexity-indeed no product at all was 
claimed-neither did the Court hold that every product 
invention must be limited by the process that produced 
the product. 

The Wood Paper Patent case 

The list of Supreme Court cases relied on by my 
colleagues continues with *1314The Wood-Paper Patent, 
90 U.S. 566, 596, 23 Wall. 566, 23 L.Ed. 31 (1874), 
where claims with the standard “substantially as described” 
language were construed in two reissue patents 
relating to the pulping of wood to make paper. The 
Court explained that one reissue patent was for “a 
product or manufacture, and not for the process by 
which the product may be obtained,” and the other “for 
a process and not for its product.” Id. at 593. The Court 
examined the prior art and concluded that the claim for 
the product could not be sustained, because the product 
produced by the inventor's new pulping process was not 
new: 

Paper-pulp obtained from various vegetable substances 
was in common use before the original patent 
was granted to Watt & Burgess, and whatever may be 
said of their process for obtaining it, the product was 
in no sense new. The reissued patent, No. 1448, is, 
therefore, void for want of novelty in the manufacture 
patented. 

Id. at 596. The Court then discussed the reissue patent 
for the “process and not for its product,” and held 
this reissue void because it claimed a different invention 
than in the original patent. The Court also discussed 
several other patents directed to boilers used to produce 
paper-pulp, and to a process for bleaching straw. Nothing 
in this case concerns the product-by-process issue 
on which the court is today acting. 

I cannot discern why the en banc court relies on 
The Wood-Paper Patent case as invalidating Scripps, 
and the court has not attempted to explain. 

Plummer v. Sargent 

The en banc court also relies on Plummer v. Sargent, 
120 U.S. 442, 7 S.Ct. 640, 30 L.Ed. 737 (1887), 
which again provides no support for my colleagues' 
thesis. This case again illustrates the Court's practice of 
reviewing what the patentee stated he invented as set 
forth in the specification in light of the prior art. The 
claim in Plummer was for a “new manufacture,” 
“substantially as described”: 

What I claim and desire to procure by letters patent is 
the new manufacture hereinabove described, consisting 
of iron ornamented in imitation of bronze by the 
application of oil and heat, substantially as described. 

Id. at 445, 7 S.Ct. 640. The trial court had found 
non-infringement because the defendant had used a prior 
art process for bronzing iron. This prior process was 
work of F.W. Brocksieper, an employee of the defendant's 
predecessor company. The Supreme Court affirmed, 
stating that the claims were limited to the process 
described in the specification: 

It seems necessarily to follow from this view either 

that the Tucker patents are void by reason of anticipa


tion practiced by Brocksieper, or that the patented 

process and product must be restricted to exactly what 

is described.... 

Id. at 449, 7 S.Ct. 640. The Court thus limited the 
claims to the process described by the patentee, not because 
of any rule about limiting a product to how it was 
made in the specification, but to sustain validity of the 
patent in view of the Brocksieper prior art. The decision

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

in Plummer is unrelated to any rule of claim construction 
based on whether process terms are included in the 
claim. 

These nineteenth-century cases do not relate to the 
en banc court's new universal rule of claim construction, 
whereby all product claims having process terms 
are treated as process claims, whatever the nature of the 
product, whatever the need for process descriptors, or 
any other factor that precedent shows to be relevant to 
the exception that is here at issue as to the use of and 
construction of such claims. Nor do any more recent 
Court cases. 

General Electric v. Wabash 

My colleagues also cite *1315General Electric Co. 

v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 
82 L.Ed. 1402 (1938), although the relevance of this 
case is, again, not apparent, for it involved no productby-
process claims, but rather claims that recite the properties 
of the product. A typical claim is claim 25, which 
describes an electric lamp filament composed of tungsten 
grains of a size and shape that prevents sagging of 
the filament: 
25. A filament for electric incandescent lamps or other 
devices, composed substantially of tungsten and 
made up mainly of a number of comparatively large 
grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial 
sagging and offsetting during a normal or commercially 
useful life for such a lamp or other device. 
Id. at 368, 58 S.Ct. 899. The Court held this claim 
“invalid on its face” for failing to provide a “distinct 
and definite statement of what he claims to be new, and 
to be his invention.” Id. at 369, 58 S.Ct. 899. The Court 
stated that the description of the grains as “of such size 
and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting” 
was “inadequate as a description of the structural 
characteristics of the grains.” Id. at 370, 58 S.Ct. 899. 
The Court also criticized the use of functional language 
in the claim, stating that such terms were too indefinite 
to provide clear guidance. Id. at 371, 58 S.Ct. 899. 
There was no issue of whether process steps in the 
claims were regarded as limiting, for there were no process 
steps in the claims. Instead, the Court stated that 

even the implicit inclusion of process steps could not 
save the claim, because the description of the process in 
the specification was inadequate: 

Even assuming that definiteness may be imparted to 

the product claim by that part of the specification 

which purportedly details only a method of making 

the product, the description of the Pacz process is 

likewise silent as to the nature of the filament 

product. 

Id. at 373, 58 S.Ct. 899. The Court held the patent 
invalid for lack of a “distinct and definite” description 
of the invention, for the court “doubted whether one 
who discovers or invents a product he knows to be new 
will ever find it impossible to describe some aspect of 
its novelty.” Id. Whatever the inadequacies in the Pacz 
description of his invention, the Court's optimistic view 
of scientific capability cannot be deemed to have barred 
all recourse to the rule of necessity when it is warranted, 
or to have voided the ensuing seventy-one years of 
Patent Office and judicial recognition of this pragmatic 
expedient. 

No Supreme Court case discussed the problems of 
complexity and structural analysis that warrant this expedient, 
or created a legal solution to these problems. It 
is inappropriate, unsupported by law or precedent, and 
contrary to the purposes of patent systems, for this court 
now to rule that such products cannot be patented as 
products. 

Regional circuit decisions 

My colleagues also rely on some decisions of the 
regional circuits preceding this court's formation, announcing 
that “our sister circuits also followed the general 
rule that the defining process terms limit productby-
process claims,” and citing two cases, one decided in 
1915 and one in 1977. These cases do not support the en 

FN4

banc court's opinion,and raised no issue of an expedient 
based on necessity. 

FN4. It is curious to observe this en banc court 
extolling decisions of the regional circuits as 
authoritative, while it disregards the decisions 
of our predecessor courts and of this court. 
This court was created to remove patent law

questions from the regional circuit courts. See 

H.R. Rep. 96-1300, at 20 (1980) (“Directing 
patent appeals to the new court will have the 
beneficial effect of removing these unusually 
complex, technically difficult, and time-
consuming cases from the dockets of the regional 
courts of appeals.... [T]he central purpose 
is to reduce the widespread lack of uniformity 
and uncertainty of legal doctrine that 
exist in the administration of patent law.”); see 
also Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1979: 
Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Improvements 
in Judicial Machinery of the Comm. on 
the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 96th Cong. 197 
(1979) (statement of Hon. Henry J. Friendly) 
(“What is needed is a group of judges, some 
but not all patent lawyers, with scientific training 
and interest, aided both by law clerks of 
similar bent and by a staff of experts in a variety 
of technologies, such as the Court of Customs 
and Patent Appeals has had for years and 
the courts of appeals in the very nature of 
things, cannot ...”). To cite two regional circuit 
decisions, while jettisoning the precedents of 
the court uniquely qualified to address patent 
questions and selected to supplant the regional 
circuits, is puzzling. 
*1316 In Hide-Ite Leather Co. v. Fiber Products 
Co., 226 F. 34 (1st Cir.1915), the appeal was of two 
process claims for making leatherboard, and a product 
claim for leatherboard “made from pulp” and reciting 
the second step in the process claims plus the reference 
“substantially as described.” The accused infringer did 
not use the same first step of the process. The court 
found that the invention was for a process, not a 
product, and therefore that the product claim was not infringed. 


My colleagues also cite Paeco, Inc. v. Applied 
Moldings, Inc., 562 F.2d 870, 876 (3d Cir.1977), in 
which the court used the specification to resolve an ambiguity 
in the language of a product claim relating to 
“replica wooden beams” made of foamed urethane. The 
court reviewed whether ambiguous claim language re


quired a closed or open mold, for this determined the 
question of anticipation based on a prior art reference 
that used an open mold. Thus the court stated that the 
manufacturing process described in the specification 
was “of paramount importance,” and construed the 
claim in light of that process as requiring a closed mold, 
thus preserving the claim's validity as against the prior 
art that used and open mold. The sentence quoted by my 
colleagues out of its context, does not relate to the en 
banc court's new rule concerning process terms in 
product claims, and the Paeco case raised no question 
of whether the product was capable of description apart 
from the process. 

In addition to these two cases inaptly cited by the 
en banc court, other regional circuit decisions also contradict 
this court's new thesis. In Dunn Wire-Cut Lug 
Brick Co. v. Toronto Fire Clay Co., 259 F. 258 (6th 
Cir.1919), the court stated: “Certain it is, in view of the 
weight of authority and the latest decisions, that the inventor 
of a new and useful product or article of manufacture 
may have a patent which covers it and gives a 
monopoly upon it regardless of great variations in the 
method of making.” Id. at 261. 

In Buono v. Yankee Maid Dress Corp., 77 F.2d 274 
(2d Cir.1935) (L.Hand, J.), the court held invalid a 
product claim for a kind of “blind stitch” used in sewing, 
because the invention lay only in the process of 
producing the stitch, which itself “was not new.” Id. at 

279. While the stitch had not been claimed as the 
product of a particular machine or process, the court remarked 
on the conceivability of patenting such a 
product “merely as the product of a machine or process, 
even though it were anticipated if made in other ways,” 
id., observing that such a claim might serve a useful 
purpose in protecting against products that were produced 
by the same machine or process abroad and then 
imported. Of such a claim, wherein the product itself 
was anticipated but the process was new, the court 
stated “it would in that case not be infringed by anything 
but the product of the ... process.” Id. This routine 
statement of established*1317 law does not mean that 
when the product is itself new and useful and unobvious, 
it cannot be claimed as a product but must be tied

to the machine that made it. 

Judge Hand emphasized that this example related 
only to situations where the product itself was not new. 
The opinion explained that to be claimed as a product, 
the product “must be new as such, that is, regardless of 
the process or machine which makes it; and it must 
stand upon its own invention, again independently of 
the machine or process which makes it.” Id. This was 
also the CCPA's view of product claims, providing the 
precedent carried forward to, and binding upon the Fed


FN5

eral Circuit.

FN5. There has been extensive commentary on 
this class of claim. See, e.g., Jon S. Saxe & Julian 
S. Levitt, Product-by-Process Claims and 
Their Current Status in Chemical Patent Office 
Practice, 42 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 528, 559 (1960) 
(“Except in the chemical arts, a claim to a 
product must be in terms of the product's objective 
physical and chemical characteristics; 
but where these are unknown or impossible to 
express, a claim may define a product in terms 
of the process by which it is made. This 
product-by-process exception is to be distinguished 
from the use of process terminology as 
descriptive of a state of being.”); Brian S. 
Tomko, Scripps or Atlantic: The Federal Circuit 
Squares Off Over the Scope of Productby-
Process Patents, 60 Brook. L.Rev. 1693, 
1696 (1995) (the Atlantic decision “pared the 
scope of a product-by-process patent to that of 
a glorified process patent”). 

III 
THE EN BANC RULING 


Defying precedent, the en banc court adopts for all 
situations “the basic rule that the process terms limit 
product-by-process claims,” maj. op. at 1293, whether 
the product is novel or known, and whether or not the 
new product could not have been fully described by its 
structure alone. The court eliminates the long-accepted 
expedient for new products whose structure is not fully 
known. While the Scripps decision is the only decision 
that is mentioned as “expressly overruled,” maj. op. at 
1293, Scripps is only one of many cases now discarded. 

The en banc majority's response to the dissenters is 
to state that “the inventor is absolutely free to use process 
steps to define this product” if its “structure is 
either not fully known or too complex to analyze,” maj. 
op. at 1294, but to eliminate the premise that the inventor 
thereby obtains a product claim, not a process claim. 
According to the majority, a patentee can continue to 
obtain product claims using process descriptors, but 
such product claims are treated as process claims for infringement. 
The applicant would still have to demonstrate 
patentability of the new product as a product 
(independent of the process), while enforcement of the 
patent against an identical product would be limited to 
the infringer's use of the process steps used as a 
descriptor. For the first time, claims are construed differently 
for validity and for infringement. 

It has been an inviolate rule that patent claims are 
construed the same way for validity and for infringement. 
See, e.g., Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, 
Inc., 314 F.3d 1313, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“It is axiomatic 
that claims are construed the same way for both 
invalidity and infringement.”); Amazon.com, Inc. v. 
Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1351 
(Fed.Cir.2001) (“Because the claims of a patent measure 
the invention at issue, the claims must be interpreted 
and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity 
and infringement analyses.”); C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 
Systems, Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1363 (Fed.Cir.1998) 
(“Claims must be interpreted the same way for determining 
infringement as was done to sustain their validity.”);

IG Co., 54 F.3d 1570, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1995) (“Claims

allowance and in a different way against accused infringers.”);

Wood Creative Products, Inc., 31 F.3d 1154, 1163

interpretation of course applies to the infringement analysis.”);

566 F.3d 1282, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

(Fed.Cir.1988) (“The claims of the '970 patent measure 
the invention at issue; thus, the claims must be interpreted 
and given the same meaning for purposes of both 
validity and infringement analyses.”); see also 5A 
Chisum on Patents § 18.01 (2007) (“A fundamental tenet 
of patent law is that a claim must be interpreted consistently 
for purposes of infringement and validity.”); 
id. § 18.03[2][h] (collecting cases). 

As interpreted for validity, the claims obtained under 
the expedient of necessity are product claims, and 
are subject to the requirements of novelty, unobviousness, 
and all other requirements for new products, independent 
of how the products can be made. My colleagues 
hold that these are product claims for validity, 
but process claims for infringement. Departure from the 
rule that forbids such deviation requires sound reason, 
and fuller exploration than the cursory brush-off dispensed 
by my colleagues. 

I do agree with my colleagues that their logic is 
“simple.” Maj. op. at 1294. However, today's inventions 
are not simple. The needs of inventions of the past and 
present, and more so the future, are not simple. The 
public interest in invention and development of today's 
complex sciences, is not simple. The en banc court's 
“simple” hypothetical about “compound X, obtained by 
process Y,” is simply irrelevant to the issues we must 
resolve. Scientists know that it is often easier to show 
that two products are the same, than to decipher their 
chemical or biological structure; for example, in the 
case at bar, comparing the X-ray diffraction patterns 
and absorption spectra could show that the products are 
the same, although their exact crystal structure is undefined. 
However, my colleagues announce that the 
only way to establish whether the accused compound is 
the same as the patented compound is by inquiring 
whether they were prepared by the same method. Maj. 
op. at 1293-94 (“[W]hat analytical tools can confirm 
that the alleged infringer's compound is in fact infringing, 
other than a comparison of the claimed and accused 
infringing processes?”). That question has many 
answers, now stated to be irrelevant. 

While the section of this opinion decided by the en 
banc court is largely directed to its reversal of preced


ent, the implementation of its ruling remains with the 
original panel. The panel decision enlarges the en banc 
ruling, further binding this court. The claims at issue 
state processes by which the new crystal form is 
“obtainable,” although the specification states that other 
methods might be used. The panel rules that a claim 
“cannot capture a product obtained by or obtainable by 
processes other than those explicitly recited in the 
claims.” maj. op. at 1295, finding authority in BASF, 
which I have discussed ante. My colleagues thus continue 
to misapply the Court's ruling in BASF, where the 
Court stated repeatedly that the product in that case was 
a known product. BASF, 111 U.S. at 311, 4 S.Ct. 455 
(“It was an old article.”). In BASF the Court responded 
to the patentee's argument that it was entitled to cover 
all artificial alizarine *1319 made by any process, by 
observing that the patentee had not shown how the infringing 
and patented products “can be recognized,” id. 
at 310, 4 S.Ct. 455, an aspect at the opposite pole from 
the case at bar, where the patentee provided elaborate 
details as to how the patented and accused crystal forms 
can be recognized. 

The panel also states that “the applicant's statement 
in the file wrapper that ‘the method of preparation ... is 
not considered the heart of the present invention’ should 
not be afforded undue gravitas.” Maj. op. at 1296. This 
too is an aberration of precedent, and is contrary to the 
many rulings of the Supreme Court and this court that 
afford due gravitas to the applicant's statement of what 
has been invented. See, e.g., BASF, 111 U.S. at 308, 4 
S.Ct. 455 (“It is very plain that the specification of the 
original patent, No. 95,465, states the invention to be a 
process for preparing alizarine, not as a new substance 
prepared for the first time, but as the substance already 
known as alizarine, to be prepared, however, by the new 
process, which process is to be the subject of the patent....”); 
Plummer v. Sargent, 120 U.S. at 443, 7 S.Ct. 
640 (quoting specification of companion patent, where 
inventor stated “My invention consists in a process of 
covering iron with a very thin coating of oil, and then 
subjecting it to heat, the effect of which is to leave upon 
the iron a firm film, which is very durable, and gives the 
iron a highly ornamental appearance, like that of 
bronze”). The Federal Circuit's emphasis on the import

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

ance of the specification has been repeatedly stated. 
E.g., Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1315 
(Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc ) (“[T]he specification is always 
highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. 
Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to 
the meaning of a disputed term.” (internal quotation 
marks omitted)). 

The en banc court appears to misjudge the implications 
of its ruling, for the court states that it is now making 
available to “others the right to freely practice process 
Z [a different process] that may produce a better 
product in a better way.” Maj. op. at 1294. If others can 
indeed make a better product, this expedient presents no 
impediment. That is not the issue of this case. The issue 
is the right to make the same product, by making a process 
change that does not change the product. By now 
assuring that right, the exclusionary value of the claim 
to a new product is lost. 

The purpose of the rule of necessity is to allow inventors 
of complex new products to obtain the patent 
scope to which their invention is entitled-the scope of 
the novel product they invented, no more and no less. 
The majority's change of law simply imposes unfairness 
as well as legal error on patent-supported advances. 

SUMMARY 

Precedent establishes that the correct construction 
of claims that recite process steps depends, like all 
claim construction, on what has been invented. No 
single rule fits all inventions. The construer must view 
the claims in light of the description of the invention in 
the specification, the prior art, and the prosecution history. 
In the complex law and practice of patents and inventions, 
the special expedient here of concern arises 
when the precise structure of a new product is not 
known from the information available when the patent 
application was filed. The law has enabled and endorsed 
this expedient of describing a product in order to claim 
it as a product, whereby validity and infringement are 
determined as a product, independent of any process 
term that was used to aid in defining the product. This 
expedient does not enlarge patent scope; it simply permits 
patenting what has been invented. A narrow*1320 
but clear body of law has evolved to accommodate this 

need of complex technologies. This entire body of law 
is today overturned, sua sponte and without a hearing, 
without any participation of those affected, without 
identification of the intended benefits. I respectfully dissent 
from the en banc court's rulings, as well as the procedure 
by which they were reached. 

LOURIE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from en banc Section 
III. A. 2. 

I respectfully dissent from the court's en banc holding 
in Section III. A. 2 that product-by-process claims 
always require use of the recited process in order to be 
infringed. 

I agree that there is substantial Supreme Court precedent 
that holds that product-by-process claims require 
use of the recited process for there to be infringement. 
However, many of those cases applied overly broad language 
to fact situations involving old products or used 
vague language that makes it difficult to determine 
whether the products were old or new. Clearly, 
however, when a product is old, a product-by-process 
claim cannot be interpreted as a claim to the product 
made by any means. The product is old and unpatentable 
per se. BASF in fact involved an old product. 
See Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik, 111 

U.S. 293, 311, 4 S.Ct. 455, 28 L.Ed. 433 (1884) (“It was 
an old article.”). 
There is arguably a different situation that should 
apply to chemical-biological products today than to 
mechanical products of more than a century ago. When 
a product is new and the inventor claims it by a process 
of preparation, I fail to see why the product-by-process 
claim should not be interpreted as a product claim that 
can be infringed even when the product is made by 
means other than that recited in the claim. Supreme 
Court precedent dealing with old products, while utilizing 
broad language, does not foreclose that possibility. 
The Court years ago did not have occasion to consider 
today's innovations or decide whether a distinction 
should be made between a new chemical-biological 
product and an old product made by a new process. 

And there may be differing results depending upon 
the exact wording of a claim at issue. For example, a

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1282) 

claim reading “when made by” might only be infringed 
when the recited process is used by the accused, as it is 
situational. On the other hand, a claim reading 
“obtainable by” refers to capability, so it might not require 
use of the process to infringe. “Obtained by” is 
ambiguous. Bright lines have their uses, but judging 
should take account of differing circumstances. In addition, 
of course, in order to sustain any claim for infringement, 
a patent owner must prove that an accused 
product is the same as that covered by an asserted 
claim. If the reason a product was claimed by its process 
was that its structure was unknown, then, if, at the 
time infringement is asserted, there still is no means to 
ascertain structurally whether the accused product is the 
same as that claimed, the infringement claim fails. 
However, that should not mean that a new product 
claimed by a process of preparation cannot ever be infringed 
when made by another process. 

It may be that with today's analytical techniques 
there is little need for product-by-process claims. After 
all, claim 1 of the Abbott patent is a claim to a compound, 
not only by name, but also by certain of its characteristics. 
A claim to a product defined by its characteristics 
or properties surely is a proper claim. 

However, product-by-process issues still seem to 
come before us and I would make a distinction between 
old products and new products in interpreting productby-
process*1321 claims. Accordingly, I respectfully 
dissent from the court's en banc holding.

No. 2008-1217. 
May 18, 2009. 


Background: Competitor filed action against nonresident 
patent owner seeking declaratory judgment 
of invalidity and non-infringement of patent relating 
to oligonucleotide microarrays for analysis of 
polynucleotides. The United States District Court 
for the Central District of California, Mariana R. 
Pfaelzer, Senior District Judge, denied jurisdictional 
discovery and dismissed action for lack of personal 
jurisdiction. Competitor appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) due process clause would not have been satisfied 
by assertion of general personal jurisdiction 
over owner; 
(2) due process clause would not have been satisfied 
by assertion of specific personal jurisdiction 
over owner; and 
(3) district court did not abuse its discretion under 
Ninth Circuit law by denying jurisdictional discovery. 
Affirmed.

Plaintiff-Appellant Autogenomics, Inc. 
(Autogenomics) sued Defendant-Appellee Oxford 
Gene Technology Limited (Oxford) in the United 
States District Court for the Central District of 
California for a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
and non-infringement of claims 9 and 10 of U.S. 
Patent No. 6,054,270 (the '270 patent). The district 
court granted Oxford's motion to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction. Autogenomics, Inc. v. Oxford 
Gene Tech., Ltd., No. SACV 07-846-MRP 

(C.D.Cal. Jan. 17, 2008). Autogenomics appeals 
this ruling, as well as the district court's denial of 
jurisdictional discovery. Because the district court 
possessed neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction 
over Oxford, and because the court did not 
abuse its discretion by denying jurisdictional discovery, 
we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

A. Jurisdictional Facts 
Oxford is a British biotechnology company organized 
under the laws of England and Wales. Oxford 
owns the '270 patent, which relates to oligonucleotide 
microarrays for analysis of polynucleotides. 
Oxford is not registered to do business in 
California, nor does it have any facilities, assets, 
employees, or agents there. Autogenomics is a biotechnology 
company organized under the laws of 
California, with its main office in Carlsbad, California. 
Autogenomics uses microarray technology 
in its business. Autogenomics alleges in support of 
the district court's personal jurisdiction that Oxford 
has several contacts with California. The jurisdictional 
facts alleged by Autogenomics are supplemented, 
where noted, by uncontradicted evidence 
presented by Oxford. 

1. Licensing Negotiations Between Autogenomics 
and Oxford: In early 2006, Oxford contacted 
Autogenomics regarding the '270 patent, which Oxford 
contends is infringed by Autogenomics's manufacture 
and sale of microarray products. In a February 
28, 2006 e-mail, Autogenomics *1015 expressed 
interest in taking a license, but provided 
Oxford with eleven references that it alleged “raise 
serious issues with regard to novelty and obviousness” 
of the '270 patent. Oxford responded by email 
on March 23, 2006, with arguments that the ' 
270 patent was valid over the references, and stated 
that “we are at a point whereby the commercial negotiations 
should begin to work to achieve a license 
for the Autogenomics product.” In July 2007, two 
Oxford representatives flew to California to meet 
with representatives of Autogenomics. The parties 
failed to agree on license terms.

2. Licenses: Oxford entered into non-exclusive 
licenses with “about ten” California companies 
with respect to its microarray technology. Although 
no license terms are in evidence, Autogenomics alleges 
that one license-not of the '270 patent in particular-
to Incyte Pharmaceutics Inc. (Incyte), a 
California company, is an exclusive license. Oxford 
claims that it has an “open licensing policy for its 
patented microarray technology, including the technology 
covered by the '270 patent,” and specifically 
admits that it granted a non-exclusive license of the 
'270 patent to Affymetrix Inc., a California company. 
3. The Agilent Agreement: According to an 
Oxford press release and an article from a public-
ally available website, Oxford and Agilent Technologies 
(Agilent)-a company with offices in California-
completed a collaborative agreement in 2007. 
Autogenomics characterizes this agreement as a 
joint venture. There is no evidence that this agreement 
involves a license or has any relationship to 
the '270 patent. It involves “a collaborative agreement 
giving [Oxford] access to Agilent's microarray 
platform, confirming [Oxford] as an Agilent 
Certified Service Provider, and appointing Agilent 
as an OEM supplier for [Oxford] designed microarrays.” 
The deal will purportedly allow the two companies 
to “jointly develop a Centre of (Microarray) 
Excellence.” Oxford executives characterize the relationship 
as a “close collaboration.” The purpose 
of the deal is to allow Oxford “to become the 
largest microarray service provider in Europe.” An 
uncontested Oxford declaration states: 
[Oxford] has a supply agreement with Agilent 
that allows [Oxford] to purchase arrays from Agilent 
for [Oxford]'s use or resale without geographical 
restriction. There is no joint venture 
between Agilent and [Oxford]. The agreement 
between Agilent and [Oxford] is not a distribution 
agreement whereby Agilent supplies 
products on [Oxford]'s behalf for or into the California 
market, or indeed to any other market. 

4. Conferences: Oxford attended three scientific 
conferences-trade shows in Autogenomics's terminology-
in California in 2003, 2005, and 2007. 
The three conferences dealt with “nanotechnology,” 
“bio-nanotechnology,” and “modeling and simulation 
of microsystems,” respectively. At the 2003 
conference, Oxford is listed among dozens of 
“presenting companies.” At the 2005 conference, 
Oxford is listed among dozens of companies under 
the heading “Past Participant Highlights.” At the 
2007 conference, Oxford was scheduled to deliver a 
20-minute presentation on “[a] method for the 
highly parallel analysis of gene expression of single 
cells.” In a 2007 company newsletter, Oxford reported 
that it would attend a fourth conference in 
California where its booth description characterized 
Oxford as focusing on “[m]icroarray services and 
application products” and stated that Oxford 
“adopts a broad licensing policy for its microarray 
patents.” 

5. Sales: In April 2006, Oxford sold 20 microarrays 
to a California company for $7,600. According 
to Oxford, the sale constituted*1016 about 
1% of its revenue that year. There is no evidence of 
what relationship, if any, there might be between 
the sale and the '270 patent. Autogenomics also alleges, 
without evidentiary support, that Oxford 
“very likely offered, and possibly contracted to perform” 
services for numerous California companies, 
reasoning that Oxford's likely clients are biotechnology 
companies largely based in California. Oxford 
provided an uncontested declaration that although 
“some of the companies” named by Autogenomics 
“either have a license agreement with [Oxford] or 
may seek a license agreement from [Oxford] in the 
future, the companies ... are not customers of 
[Oxford], and are not likely to be.” 
6. Publication: Oxford published an 
“application note” on Nature.com, the globally-
accessible website of Nature, a United Kingdom 
scientific publication. The application note describes 
an Oxford microarray product. Autogenomics 
characterizes the application note as an advertisement 
to California companies, noting that the

B. Procedural Background 
On July 23, 2007, Autogenomics filed a declaratory 
judgment action against Oxford in the United 
States District Court for the Central District of 
California. Autogenomics asked the court to find 
that claims 9 and 10 of the ' 270 patent are invalid 
or unenforceable, and that Autogenomics did not 
infringe the same claims. On November 27, 2007, 
Oxford filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the 
district court lacked either general or specific personal 
jurisdiction over it. 

On January 17, 2008, the district court ruled 
that it lacked general jurisdiction because Oxford's 
contacts with California were insufficient to be the 
equivalent of having a physical presence within the 
state. Autogenomics, No. SACV 07-846-MRP at 
8-11. The court further ruled that it lacked specific 
jurisdiction because the declaratory judgment action 
did not arise from or relate to most of the contacts 
alleged by Autogenomics, and those contacts 
that did relate to the declaratory judgment action 
nonetheless did not contribute to jurisdiction under 
our holding in Red Wing Shoe Co. v. Hockerson-
Halberstadt, Inc., 148 F.3d 1355 (Fed.Cir.1998). 
Autogenomics, No. SACV 07-846-MRP at 11-16. 
Finally, the court denied Autogenomics the opportunity 
to conduct jurisdictional discovery because 
Autogenomics failed to make a formal motion and 
failed to show that discovery would demonstrate 
facts sufficient to constitute a basis for jurisdiction. 
Id. at 17 n. 3. Autogenomics appeals the district 
court's ruling that it lacked personal jurisdiction 
over Oxford, as well as the district court's denial of 
jurisdictional discovery. 

DISCUSSION 

I.

“Moreover, we apply Federal Circuit law because 
the jurisdictional issue is ‘intimately involved with 
the substance of the patent laws.’ ” Id. (quoting Akro

(Fed.Cir.1994) (“Under [jurisdictional] circumstances 
such as these, we have held we owe no special 
deference to regional circuit law.”). 

*1017 “In this case, ‘because the parties have 
not conducted discovery, [Autogenomics] needed 
only to make a prima facie showing that [Oxford] 
was subject to personal jurisdiction. As such, the 
pleadings and affidavits are to be construed in the 
light most favorable to [Autogenomics].’ ” Avocent,

[5][6] Autogenomics argues that the district 
court has personal jurisdiction over Oxford on two 
bases: general and specific personal jurisdiction. 
General jurisdiction, on one hand, “requires that the 
defendant have ‘continuous and systematic’ contacts 
with the forum state and confers personal jurisdiction 
even when the cause of action has no relationship 
with those contacts.” Silent Drive, 326 
F.3d at 1200 (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de 
Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 416, 104 
S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984)). Specific jurisdiction, 
on the other hand, must be based on activities 
that arise out of or relate to the cause of action, 
and can exist even if the defendant's contacts are 
not continuous and systematic. Id. (citing Burger 
King, 471 U.S. at 472-73, 105 S.Ct. 2174). We will 
address general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction 
in turn. 

A. 
[7] The district court correctly ruled that it 
lacked general personal jurisdiction over Oxford. 
Oxford does not have contacts with the forum state 
that qualify as “continuous and systematic general 
business contacts.” Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 416, 
104 S.Ct. 1868. Rather, this “is a classic case of 
sporadic and insubstantial contacts with the forum 
state, which are not sufficient to establish general 
jurisdiction over the defendants in the forum.” 
Campbell Pet Co. v. Miale, 542 F.3d 879, 884 
(Fed.Cir.2008). In Helicopteros, the Supreme Court 
rejected the plaintiff's assertion of personal jurisdiction 
in Texas where the defendant did not have a 
place of business in Texas and had never been licensed 
to do business in the state. 466 U.S. at 416, 
104 S.Ct. 1868. The Supreme Court reached this 
conclusion despite the fact that the defendant 
“sen[t] its chief executive officer to Houston for a 
contract-negotiation session; accept[ed] into its 
New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston 
bank; purchas[ed] helicopters, *1018 equip


ment, and training services from Bell Helicopter for 
substantial sums; and sen[t] personnel to Bell's facilities 
in Fort Worth for training.” Id. Like the defendant 
in Helicopteros, Oxford has no actual physical 
presence or license to do business in California, 
and nothing here exceeds the commercial contacts 
that the Supreme Court held were insufficient in 

Helicopteros. 

While acknowledging that the standard for general 
jurisdiction is “fairly high,” Autogenomics argues 
that Oxford's attendance at several conferences 
in California approximated a physical presence 
within the state. Autogenomics urges us to infer 
that “Oxford was using its conference appearances 
to meet with existing and potential customers, 
just as it would if it had an office.” We decline 
to do so. Although we must resolve factual conflicts 
in Autogenomics's favor, it is entitled to only those 
inferences that are reasonable. Pennington Seed, 
Inc. v. Produce Exch. No. 299, 457 F.3d 1334, 1338 
(Fed.Cir.2006). Although it is reasonable to infer 
that Oxford meets potential customers at conferences, 
it is not reasonable to infer that this means 
that Oxford's conference booths are “mobile offices,” 
and ultimately, four conferences over five 
years constitute only sporadic and insubstantial 
contacts. See Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d at 881-82 
(holding no general jurisdiction despite defendant's 
attendance at a conference where she demonstrated 
her products, offered them for sale, took orders, 
threatened competitors and harassed her competitor's 
customers). 

Autogenomics also points to the Agilent agreement 
as evidence of continuous and systematic contacts. 
We cannot reasonably infer from the Agilent 
agreement that the agreement will cause Oxford to 
have significantly more contact with California 
than the defendant in Helicopteros had with Texas-
repeated purchases and visits by personnel over a 
number of years. See 466 U.S. at 418, 104 S.Ct. 
1868 (holding that “purchases, even if occurring at 
regular intervals” and visits by personnel in connection 
with the purchases were insufficient to es

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

tablish general personal jurisdiction). All of the 
contacts alleged by Autogenomics, even in combination, 
are insufficient evidence of continuous and 
systematic contacts. See Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d at 
883-84 (holding that conference attendance in the 
forum, a cease-and-desist letter sent into the forum, 
twelve sales in the forum totaling about $14,000 in 
revenue, and a generally accessible website were 
insufficient to give rise to general jurisdiction). We 
similarly considered the litany of inferences that 
Autogenomics insists we should draw from the jurisdictional 
facts, and likewise conclude that they 
are either unreasonable or even if reasonable, ultimately 
insufficient. Thus, we conclude that the district 
court lacked general personal jurisdiction over 
Oxford. 

B. 
[8][9] Where a defendant is not subject to general 
personal jurisdiction in the forum state, a district 
court may nonetheless exercise specific personal 
jurisdiction over the defendant subject to a 
three part test: 

(1) the defendant purposefully directed its activities 
at residents of the forum, (2) the claim arises 
out of or relates to those activities, and (3) assertion 
of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and 
fair. With respect to the last prong, the burden of 
proof is on the defendant, which must “present a 
compelling case that the presence of some other 
considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable” 
under the five-factor test articulated by 
the Supreme Court in Burger King. 
Breckenridge Pharm., Inc. v. Metabolite Labs., 
Inc., 444 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2006) (quoting 
*1019Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 
2174). “The first two factors correspond with the 
‘minimum contacts' prong of the International Shoe 
analysis, and the third factor corresponds with the 
‘fair play and substantial justice’ prong of the analysis.” 
Inamed, 249 F.3d at 1360 (citing Akro, 45 
F.3d at 1545); see also Int'l Shoe Co. v. Wash., 326 

U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). 
[10] The district court's decision that it lacked 
specific personal jurisdiction was largely based on 
Red Wing Shoe, which held that “cease-and-desist 
letters alone do not suffice to justify personal jurisdiction” 
in a declaratory judgment action. 148 F.3d 
at 1361. The district court concluded that the e-mail 
and in-person negotiations between Oxford and 
Autogenomics were “clearly analogous to the 
‘cease-and-desist’ communications at issue in the 
bevy of cases on this subject.” Autogenomics, No. 
SACV 07-846-MRP at 12-13. With regard to the 
other jurisdictional facts asserted by Autogenomics, 
the court acknowledged that we have held that in 
combination with cease-and-desist communications, 
other activities can give rise to specific personal 
jurisdiction. See e.g., Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d 
at 885-87 (holding that attempts at “extra-judicial 
patent enforcement” by harming plaintiff's business 
activities in forum state is a sufficient additional 
factor to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction); 
Breckenridge, 444 F.3d at 1366-67 (holding 
that entry into an exclusive license with an entity in 
the forum state is sufficient extra activity to establish 
jurisdiction); Genetic Implant, 123 F.3d at 
1458 (holding that the forum had jurisdiction over 
the patentee that “contracted with [an exclusive distributor] 
to sell [the] patented products in [the forum 
State]” where the agreement was “analogous to 
a grant of a patent license”); Viam Corp. v. Iowa 
Exp.-Imp. Trading Co., 84 F.3d 424, 430 
(Fed.Cir.1996) (holding that personal jurisdiction 
exists where “according to their own submission to 
this court, [the defendants] have initiated a suit 
seeking to enforce the same patent that is the subject 
of this suit against other parties, unrelated to 
this action, in the same district court”); Akro, 45 
F.3d at 1548-49 (holding that exclusive licensing of 
the accused infringer's competitor in the forum state 
constituted the required “additional activity” beyond 
sending warning letters). Here, the district 
court concluded that the other contacts asserted by 
Autogenomics did not arise from or relate to the declaratory 
judgment cause of action. Because it 
viewed these “other activities” as irrelevant to the 
question of specific personal jurisdiction, the court

566 F.3d 1012, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1006 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

concluded that it did not have personal jurisdiction 
over Oxford. 

[11] The district court's decision and the principal 
briefing on appeal occurred before our decision 
in Avocent. In that case, we endeavored to 
reconcile our decisions regarding personal jurisdiction 
in declaratory judgment actions, and concluded 
the following: 
While exclusive licensing agreements and other 
undertakings that impose enforcement obligations 
on a patentee or its licensee reflect the kind of 
“other activities” that support specific personal 
jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action, the 
defendant patentee's own commercialization 
activity does not. What the patentee makes, uses, 
offers to sell, sells, or imports is of no real relevance 
to the enforcement or defense of a patent, 
because “the federal patent laws do not create any 
affirmative right to make, use, or sell anything.” 

Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1335 (quoting Leather-
man Tool Group Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 131 
F.3d 1011, 1015 (Fed.Cir.1997)). Avocent explained 
that the contacts material to the specific jurisdiction 
analysis in a *1020 declaratory judgment 
action are not just any activities related to the pat-
ent-at-issue. Rather, the relevant activities are those 
that the defendant “purposefully directs ... at the 
forum which relate in some material way to the enforcement 
or the defense of the patent.” Id. at 1336. 
Thus, courts must examine the jurisdictional facts 
for conduct whereby the patentee “may be said to 
purposefully avail itself of the forum and to engage 
in activity that relates to the validity and enforceability 
of the patent.” Id. In Red Wing Shoe, we observed 
that the logic of this rule does not flow from 
the fact that the action is for declaratory judgment 
because indeed, cease-and-desist letters are the very 
reason for such an action: 

In the event a patentee casts its net of ceaseand-
desist letters too widely and entangles some 
non-infringing products, a plaintiff may have 
little recourse other than a declaratory judgment 
action to disentangle its non-infringing business. 

In those instances, the cease-and-desist letters are 
the cause of the entanglement and at least partially 
give rise to the plaintiff's action. In sum, 
the mirror-image analysis does not account for 
the legitimate use of a declaratory judgment action 
as a disentanglement tool. Thus, it ignores 
the essential fact that in a declaratory judgment 
action, the patentee is, after all, the defendant. 

148 F.3d at 1360. Rather, we explained that: 

Principles of fair play and substantial justice af


ford a patentee sufficient latitude to inform others 

of its patent rights without subjecting itself to jur


isdiction in a foreign forum. A patentee should 

not subject itself to personal jurisdiction in a for


um solely by informing a party who happens to 

be located there of suspected infringement. 

Grounding personal jurisdiction on such contacts 

alone would not comport with principles of fair


ness. 

Id. at 1360-61. 

[12] Our holding in Avocent was that only enforcement 
or defense efforts related to the patent 
rather than the patentee's own commercialization 
efforts are to be considered for establishing specific 
personal jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action 
against the patentee. 552 F.3d at 1336. The dissent 
suggests that this reading of Avocent renders it 
in conflict with other precedent of this court. The 
court in Avocent, however, considered and distinguished 
the very precedent that the dissent cites. 
552 F.3d at 1334-35, 1338-39 (discussing Viam, 
Campbell Pet, and Red Wing Shoe ). In Viam, for 
example, where this court held personal jurisdiction 
existed, the patentee had sued another infringer in 
the same court on the same patent-enforcement efforts 
in the forum. 84 F.3d at 430. In Campbell Pet, 
where the court held personal jurisdiction existed, 
the patentee had enlisted a third party to remove the 
defendant's products from a trade show that was being 
held in the forum state-enforcement efforts in 
the forum. 542 F.3d at 886. In Red Wing Shoe, despite 
the patentee's thirty-four non-exclusive licensees 
selling the patented product in the forum

State, no personal jurisdiction existed because of an 
absence of enforcement efforts. 148 F.3d at 1359,

1362.

FN1. The dissent also suggests that this decision 
is inconsistent with our court's recent 
decision in Synthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M. 
Dos Reis Jr. Ind. Com. de Equip. Medico, 
563 F.3d 1285 (Fed.Cir.2009). Synthes was 
not a declaratory judgment action against 
the patent holder but rather an infringement 
suit brought by the patentee against 
an accused infringer, where commercialization-
type contacts are highly relevant to 
personal jurisdiction. By contrast, in Avocent 
we held that “[w]hat the patentee 
makes, uses, offers to sell, sells, or imports 
is of no real relevance to the enforcement 
or defense of a patent.” 552 F.3d at 1335. 
The dissent may be correct that Red Wing 
Shoe rested not on this reasoning, but 
rather on principles of fairness. See 148 
F.3d at 1360-61. Regardless of whether 
Avocent went further than Red Wing Shoe 
required, it is now clear and binding precedent. 


*1021 Although we too are concerned that foreign 
patentees like Oxford may engage in significant 
commercialization and licensing efforts in a 
state while benefiting from the shelter of the Avocent 
rule, we are nonetheless bound by Avocent. We 
note, however, that it is not the case that the 50% of 
all patentees who are foreign “are always immunized 
from adjudication” as the dissent suggests. Jurisdiction 
over foreign patentees like Oxford continues 
to be available in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia. See 35 U.S.C. § 

293. 
Because principal briefing had been completed 
in this case prior to our decision in Avocent, on 
December 19, 2008, we asked the parties to submit 
supplemental briefing addressing Avocent. Autogenomics 
had originally argued that Oxford had nine 
types of contacts with California. In its supplement


al brief, Autogenomics concedes that our “holding 
in Avocent eliminated seven of those nine types of 
contacts in the context of a declaratory judgment 
action.” Appellant's Supplemental Br. 2. Autogenomics 
explained that only two of the alleged types 
of contacts Oxford had with California were still 
relevant to the specific jurisdiction inquiry: the 
Agilent agreement and the licenses. Id. at 2-3. 

First, Autogenomics asserts that the Agilent 
agreement is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over 
Oxford. We disagree. Although Agilent is a California 
company, and the agreement was created to 
pursue the field of microarrays, there is nothing in 
evidence, nor would it be a reasonable inference, to 
suggest that this agreement involves the '270 patent 
or is “analogous to a grant of a patent license.” Genetic 
Implant, 123 F.3d at 1458. 

Second, Autogenomics argues that we should 
infer that Oxford gave an exclusive license that 
relates to the '270 patent. As support for this contention, 
Autogenomics argues that the allegedly exclusive 
Incyte license means that the following declaration 
of Oxford's director of licensing and business 
development is false: “[Oxford] has an open licensing 
policy for its patented microarray technology, 
including the technology covered by the '270 
patents. All of [Oxford's] licenses are nonexclusive....” 
Even though the Incyte license “does not relate 
to the patent-at-issue in our case,” Autogenomics 
argues that because of this apparent inconsistency, 
we should infer that Oxford is hiding an exclusive 
license of the '270 patent. We disagree because 
although the inconsistency greatly weakens 
the strength of Oxford's declaration, it is nonetheless 
undisputed that there are numerous nonexclusive 
licenses of the '270 patent. Because of 
this, it cannot be a reasonable inference that there is 
also an exclusive license of the same patent. We 
therefore conclude that the district court does not 
have specific personal jurisdiction over Oxford because 
Autogenomics has failed to allege sufficient

[13][14][15] Autogenomics also appeals the 
district court's denial of jurisdictional discovery. 
We review the district court's denial of discovery, 
an issue not unique to patent law, for abuse of discretion, 
applying the law of the regional circuit. 
*1022Digeo, Inc. v. Audible, Inc., 505 F.3d 1362, 
1370 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing Qualls v. Blue Cross, 
Inc., 22 F.3d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1994)); see also 
Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy, 453 F.3d 1151, 1154 
(9th Cir.2006) (“We review a district court's decision 
to grant or deny discovery on jurisdictional 
facts for abuse of discretion.”). “A reviewing court 
will not disturb a denial of additional discovery unless 
there is ‘the clearest showing’ that the denial 
will result in ‘actual and substantial prejudice to the 
complaining litigant’ (e.g., ‘a reasonable probability 
that the outcome would have been different had 
discovery been allowed’).” Digeo, 505 F.3d at 1370 
(quoting Laub v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 342 F.3d 
1080, 1093 (9th Cir.2003)). 

In this case, there is no denial of a motion for 
jurisdictional discovery for us to review because 
there was no formal motion for jurisdictional discovery. 
According to an uncontroverted declaration 
by counsel for Oxford, on November 26, 2007, 
counsel for Oxford contacted counsel for Autogenomics 
to warn him of the pending motion to dismiss 
for lack of personal jurisdiction. After discussing 
arguments relating to jurisdiction, counsel for 
Autogenomics raised the possibility of jurisdictional 
discovery, and asked for the contact information 
of relevant people at Oxford. Counsel for Oxford 
identified two people and indicated that he was 
willing to discuss the issue further, even after Oxford 
filed its motion to dismiss. Counsel for Autogenomics 
said that he would call back within a few 
days, but he did not. Oxford filed its motion to dismiss 
on November 27, 2007. 

In its opposition to Oxford's motion to dismiss, 
filed December 21, 2007, Autogenomics stated, 
without elaboration, that “[i]n the event that the 

Court is not completely convinced of jurisdiction, 
Autogenomics hereby requests that the Court grant 
limited discovery.” On December 28, 2007, the district 
court attempted to contact counsel for Autogenomics 
to advise him of how to properly request 
jurisdictional discovery. On January 2, 2008, counsel 
for Autogenomics returned the court's telephone 
call, leaving a message for the clerk. At the hearing 
for the motion to dismiss on January 14, 2008, 
Autogenomics reiterated its request for jurisdictional 
discovery. The district court noted that it never 
received the required formal motion. In its January 
17, 2008 ruling, the court refused to grant jurisdictional 
discovery. The court found that the suggestions 
at oral argument and in the opposition brief 
were insufficient, and regardless, that Autogenomics 
had “not shown, with any degree of specificity, 
that discovery would ‘demonstrate facts sufficient 
to constitute a basis for jurisdiction.’ ” Autogenomics, 
No. SACV 07-846-MRP at 17 n. 3 (quoting 

Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., 

556 F.2d 406, 430 n. 24 (9th Cir.1977)). 

[16] The district court did not abuse its discretion 
by denying jurisdictional discovery. As an initial 
matter, the district court is correct that under 
Ninth Circuit law, it is not necessarily an abuse of 
discretion to reject a request for jurisdictional discovery 
because no formal motion was made. Sopcak 
v. N. Mountain Helicopter Serv., 52 F.3d 817, 
819 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that district court did 
not abuse its discretion by denying discovery where 
“rather than moving for extension of time to oppose 
the dismissal motion, the Appellants filed an opposition 
which stated in part: ‘[h]owever, if the court 
believes that there is not sufficient evidence to support 
plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegation, plaintiffs 
respectfully request an opportunity to conduct discovery’ 
”). Autogenomics attempts to distinguish 
Sopcak by arguing that it did not become aware that 
jurisdictional discovery would be necessary until 
“days before filing its opposition.” It is *1023 undisputed, 
however, that Autogenomics considered 
and discussed jurisdictional discovery issues with 
opposing counsel before Oxford filed its motion to

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

dismiss. Moreover, by proactively contacting counsel 
for Autogenomics, the judge expressed a willingness 
to consider a formal motion even after 
Autogenomics made its unsupported request in its 
opposition brief. And of course, Autogenomics 
could have moved for an extension of time as the 
Ninth Circuit suggested in Sopcak. Autogenomics 
“can not now complain that the court erred by not 
allowing them to conduct eleventh-hour discovery 

FN2

upon an adverse ruling.” Id.

FN2. Autogenomics relies on Commissariat 
A L'Energie Atomique v. Chi Mei Optoelectronics 
Corp., 395 F.3d 1315, 1323 
(Fed.Cir.2005), which applied Third Circuit 
law to hold that “plaintiffs did not 
waive their right to discovery, but preserved 
the issue by, [a] initially requesting 
discovery in their opposition to the motion 
to dismiss, [b] a request that was reiterated 
during oral argument, and [c] reasserted ... 
in greater detail in their motion for reconsideration.” 
This rule, regardless of its 
merits, cannot overrule the Ninth Circuit's 
law here. Even if this rule were applicable, 
Autogenomics failed at any point, much 
less in a motion for reconsideration, to 
provide the district court “greater detail,” 
much less any detailed reasons at all for 
seeking discovery. 

Furthermore, although we held in Commissariat 
that “[i]n determining the relevance 
of a request for jurisdictional discovery, 
we apply Federal Circuit law,” 
that is not our task here. 395 F.3d at 
1323. Rather, we are making a threshold 
decision of whether the denial of discovery 
was an abuse of discretion where the 
plaintiff failed to make a formal motion 
and failed to articulate any reasons for 
why discovery was necessary. See id. at 
1322 (“On procedural issues such as the 
timeliness of discovery requests, we are 
guided by the law of the regional circuit 

in which the district court sits.”). This is 
a question controlled by Ninth Circuit 
law. Indeed, we cannot evaluate the 
“relevance” of Autogenomics's request 
because it provided the district court 
with no reasons for its request or particular 
areas to which discovery would be 
directed. In Commissariat, by contrast, 
the plaintiff “clearly made a sufficient 
threshold showing to merit jurisdictional 
discovery.” Id. at 1323. Autogenomics 
made no such showing. 

Furthermore, as the district court noted, “[a]n 
appellate court will not interfere with the trial 
court's refusal to grant discovery except upon the 
clearest showing that the dismissal resulted in actual 
and substantial prejudice to the litigant; such a 
refusal is not an abuse of discretion when it is clear 
that further discovery would not demonstrate facts 
sufficient to constitute a basis for jurisdiction.” 
Wells Fargo, 556 F.2d at 430 n. 24; see also Laub, 
342 F.3d at 1093 (“Prejudice is established if there 
is a reasonable probability that the outcome would 
have been different had discovery been allowed.”). 
Autogenomics did not make, either in its opposition 
brief or at the motion hearing, a showing that further 
discovery would elucidate the facts necessary 
to prove that the court had personal jurisdiction. 
Such a showing is especially important where, as 
here, the defendant enters declarations into evidence 
specifically denying certain jurisdictional allegations. 
Terracom v. Valley Nat'l Bank, 49 F.3d 
555, 562 (9th Cir.1995) (“[W]here a plaintiff's 
claim of personal jurisdiction appears to be both attenuated 
and based on bare allegations in the face 
of specific denials made by defendants, the Court 
need not permit even limited discovery....”). Only 
now, on appeal, does Autogenomics explain how 
discovery could help establish the court's jurisdiction. 
We need not evaluate the merits of these arguments 
because they were never made to the district 
court, and thus do not have any bearing on our review 
of the district court's decision for abuse of discretion. 
Nor do we agree with Autogenomics that

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

the arguments are so “obvious” that the court 
should have reached them as reasonable inferences 
in *1024 view of the jurisdictional facts it had before 
it. Therefore, we conclude that the district 
court acted within its discretion by denying Autogenomics's 
request for jurisdictional discovery. 

CONCLUSION 

The district court possessed neither general nor 
specific personal jurisdiction over Oxford, and the 
court did not abuse its discretion by denying Autogenomics's 
request for jurisdictional discovery. The 
judgment below is 

AFFIRMED. 

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

The Federal Circuit again restricts United 
States parties from access to our courts when a 
United States patent is owned by a foreign entity. 
The court rules that the foreign patent owner is not 
subject to suit in California despite its commercial 
presence in California including the grant of at least 
ten patent licenses to companies in California; despite 
a manufacturing venture of the patent owner 
with a California-based company to produce and 
sell microarrays designed by the patent owner; despite 
participation by the patent owner with respect 
to the patented technology in trade shows and scientific 
meetings in California; and despite the patent 
owner's threats of infringement against Autogenomics, 
a California company whose accused activities 
are conducted in California. On the entirety of 
these contacts, jurisdiction of this declaratory judgment 
action was proper in the Central District of 
California. From my colleagues' contrary ruling, I 
respectfully dissent. 

DISCUSSION 

It is not disputed that there is a “case of actual 
controversy” in accordance with the Declaratory 
Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), between the 
patent owner Oxford Gene Technology Inc., a British 
company, and the plaintiff Autogenomics. The 
only question is whether the requirements of personal 
jurisdiction have been met in California, the 

resident forum of Autogenomics, recognizing that 
Oxford is not registered to do business in any of the 
United States. 

Where a foreign defendant has not consented to 
suit in a forum, the inquiry into personal jurisdiction 
turns on a trio of criteria, generally designated 
as purposeful availment, relatedness, and reasonableness. 
Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 

U.S. 462, 472-77, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 
(1985); Akro Corp. v. Luker, 45 F.3d 1541, 1545 
(Fed.Cir.1995). First, the defendant must have purposefully 
availed itself of the forum by conducting 
activities in the forum. Second, the plaintiff's claim 
must arise from or be related to the defendant's 
activities in the forum. And third, the court's exercise 
of personal jurisdiction must comport with the 
principles of due process and fairness. 
Autogenomics readily made a prima facie 
showing as to these criteria, for Oxford owns several 
United States patents, including the patent that is 
the subject of this declaratory action, and is exercising 
its United States patent rights through approximately 
ten licensees in California. Autogenomics 
states that Oxford has entered into a manufacturing 
venture with the California company Agilent, 
whereby Agilent serves as a California-based 
supplier of microarrays designed by Oxford. Oxford's 
employees have personally exhibited the Oxford 
technology at trade shows in California and 
publicized the availability of licenses for Oxford's 
United States patents. The record shows sale of Oxford 
microarray products to at least one customer in 
California. Oxford employees *1025 traveled to 
California and negotiated with Autogenomics in 
that forum. In addition, California is the primary 
site of Autogenomics' business, the forum in which 
the accused infringing activities are conducted, and 
in which Oxford's threatened enforcement of its 
patent would occur. Many of Oxford's contacts with 
California relate directly to the ' 270 patent, the 
subject of this lawsuit. 

The reasonableness inquiry applies to both defendant 
and plaintiff, invoking “notions of fair play

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

and substantial justice,” Akro, 45 F.3d at 1546, as 
measured by factors such as those discussed in Burger 
King: 

[C]ourts in appropriate cases may evaluate the 
burden on the defendant, the forum State's interest 
in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's 
interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, 
the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining 
the most efficient resolution of controversies, 
and the shared interest of the several States 
in furthering fundamental substantive social 
policies. 

471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting 
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 

U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 
(1980)) (quotation marks omitted). Considerations 
of reasonableness give effect to the equitable authority 
of courts to provide access to adjudication 
when such is warranted, while protecting both sides 
from unfair burdens. Considerations of fairness and 
justice are central to the due process analysis, the 
Court observing that “[t]hese considerations sometimes 
serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction 
upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts 
than would otherwise be required.” Burger King, 
471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (citing Keeton v. 
Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 780, 104 
S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984); Calder v. 
Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 788-89, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 
L.Ed.2d 804 (1984); McGee v. International Life 
Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223-24, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 
L.Ed.2d 223 (1957)). 
Autogenomics brought this declaratory judgment 
action in the forum of its corporate residence 
and principal place of business, the location of the 
activities that Oxford says infringe its United States 
patents. The compulsory counterclaim of infringement 
would center on activities in the Central District 
of California. No other forum has been asserted 
by Oxford to be more convenient; indeed, the 
entire relationship between Oxford and Autogenomics 
has been in the California forum, which is a 
primary locus of the biotechnology industry in 

which both parties are engaged. All of these factors 
are relevant to the inquiry of whether “the quality 
and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and 
orderly administration of the laws” is sufficient for 
a forum to exercise jurisdiction. International Shoe 
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 
154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). 

Personal jurisdiction of owners of United 
States patents has been recognized in circumstances 
no closer to the forum than those here. In Campbell 
Pet Co. v. Miale, 542 F.3d 879 (Fed.Cir.2008), this 
court held that the patentee, a corporation having a 
California residence, was nonetheless subject to 
personal jurisdiction in the state of Washington, 
upon having attended a trade show in Washington 
and complained about the plaintiff's display, then 
writing to the plaintiff in Washington, charging infringement. 
Id. at 886. In Viam Corp. v. Iowa Export-
Import Trading Co., 84 F.3d 424 
(Fed.Cir.1996), this court held that the Central District 
of California had personal jurisdiction of the 
Italian corporation SPAL, which owned a United 
States patent. SPAL had no United States residence, 
although it had an exclusive distributor resident in 
Iowa, and its only activity *1026 involving California 
was the importation and sale of the patented 
goods in California by its distributor; but this court 
held: “There is sufficient connection between [the 
non-resident patent owner's and its distributor's] 
activity and the litigation to satisfy [the minimum 
contacts] prong of the International Shoe Due Process 
test.” Id. at 429. This court determined that the 
foreign patentee “ha[d] ‘purposefully availed himself 
of the privilege of conducting activities within 
the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections 
of its laws.’ ” Id. at 428 (quoting Hanson v. 
Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 
L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)). The court also observed that 
“allowing the forum to exercise jurisdiction cannot 
be said to be unfair.” Id. at 430. 

The comparison with Viam is informative, for 
both Oxford and SPAL are foreign owners of 
United States patents who do business in the forum

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

without themselves residing in the forum. In Oxford's 
case its patented inventions are placed in 
United States commerce through manufacture by 
United States licensees, providing a more direct 
connection with United States commerce than the 
importation of products manufactured offshore. Oxford's 
contacts with the California forum are not 
“random, fortuitous, or attenuated,” Burger King, 
471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (internal quotation 
marks omitted), but are the normal course of Oxford's 
business of exploiting and profiting from its 
United States patents. 

Today's ruling is also incompatible with this 
court's recent decision in Synthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M. 
Dos Reis Jr. Ind. Com. de Equip. Medico, 563 F.3d 
1285 (Fed.Cir.2009). Synthes involved a patent infringement 
suit filed by a United States plaintiff 
against a Brazilian entity whose products were 
offered for sale at trade shows in the United States, 
although no actual sales of the allegedly infringing 
products were made in the United States. The 
Brazilian company had no office or subsidiary or licensee 
in the United States, although it purchased 
United States products for use or resale in Brazil. 
This court applied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 

FN1

4(k)(2), the “federal long-arm statute,” and 
held that the entire United States is an available forum. 
563 F.3d at 1290. The court considered the entirety 
of the contacts, and found them sufficient to 
establish specific personal jurisdiction over the 
Brazilian defendant. Id. at 1292. The court stressed 
that the Brazilian company's attendance at trade 
shows in the United States included display of an 
allegedly infringing product. Id. at 1292. My colleagues 
assert that Synthes is not relevant merely 
because the foreign party was the accused infringer, 
rather than the patentee. See maj. op. at 1020-21 n. 

1. But this court has previously recognized that this 
is not a valid means of distinguishing cases, for 
Viam relied on the stream of commerce to establish 
personal jurisdiction, see Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. 
Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558, 1566 
(Fed.Cir.1994), although the foreign defendant in 
Beverly Hills Fan was the accused infringer rather 
than the patentee. See Viam, 84 F.3d at 428 (“All 
the reasons for adopting and applying the stream of 
commerce theory to the question of personal jurisdiction 
*1027 over an out-of-state alleged infringer 
as defendant, fully explored in Beverly Hills Fan, 
are equally applicable to the same question regarding 
an out-of-state patentee as defendant.”). 

FN1. Rule 4(k)(2) states: 

(2) Federal Claim Outside State-Court 
Jurisdiction 
For a claim that arises under federal law, 
serving a summons or filing a waiver of 
service establishes personal jurisdiction 
over a defendant if: 

(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction 
in any state's courts of general 
jurisdiction; and 
(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent 
with the United States Constitution and 
laws. 
On considering the interests of both sides to 
this dispute, in light of precedent, it has not been 
shown that subjecting Oxford to suit in California is 
either unreasonable or unfair. My colleagues on this 
panel hold that the California forum has neither 
general nor specific jurisdiction over Oxford, although 
the Central District of California is the forum 
most directly related to Oxford's activities in 
the United States, as well as being the locus of the 
accused infringement. Nonetheless, this court immunizes 
Oxford, the owner of a United States patent, 
from resolution of the patent dispute. This 
court has recognized that “[j]ust as a state has a 
substantial interest in preventing patent infringement 
within its borders, it also has a substantial interest 
in protecting its residents from claims of patent 
infringement that may be unwarranted.” Deprenyl 
Animal Health, Inc. v. Univ. of Toronto Innovations 
Found., 297 F.3d 1343, 1356 
(Fed.Cir.2002).

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012) 

Depriving Autogenomics of the opportunity to 
resolve the threat of infringement is contrary to the 
purpose and principles of the Declaratory Judgment 
Act. See MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 

U.S. 118, 128-32, 127 S.Ct. 764, 166 L.Ed.2d 604 
(2007) (explaining that public policy favors declaratory 
challenge to adverse patents by persons 
whose substantial rights may be affected). 
My colleagues on this panel, in support of their 
ruling that Oxford cannot be sued in California, cite 
this court's recent holding in Avocent Huntsville 
Corp. v. Aten International Co., 552 F.3d 1324, 
1335 (Fed.Cir.2008). However, if Avocent is read to 
bar this suit, it is in conflict with precedent of this 
court and the Supreme Court, as discussed therein. 
See id. at 1341-51 (Newman, J., dissenting). Viam 
held that the foreign patent owner's sales (through a 
distributor) in the forum sufficed to support personal 
jurisdiction, while Avocent ruled that such sales 
are irrelevant to personal jurisdiction. This direct 
conflict simply adds confusion; however, this court 
remains bound by the “rule of interpanel accord,” 
which is that in the event of conflict, real or perceived, 
the earlier decision controls until the conflict 
is resolved. See, e.g., Newell Cos. v. Kenney 
Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed.Cir.1988). 

The panel majority also cites the statement in 

Red Wing Shoe Inc. v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc., 

148 F.3d 1355 (Fed.Cir.1998), that “[p]rinciples of 
fair play and substantial justice afford a patentee 
sufficient latitude to inform others of its patent 
rights without subjecting itself to jurisdiction in the 
foreign forum,” id. at 1360-61, principles with 
which I fully agree. However, while the Red Wing 
court made this statement to explain why personal 
jurisdiction does not arise from infringement letters, 
the court seems to have confused personal jurisdiction 
with the showing of a “case or controversy” 
that is needed to establish subject matter jurisdiction 
for a declaratory judgment action. Whether 
accusations of infringement are actionable in a 
specific case has no relation to where suit may be 
brought when a case or controversy does indeed ex


ist, as in this case. 

The evolving law under MedImmune facilitates 
challenge to adversely held patents. See, e.g., 
SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 
F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2007) (“The Supreme 
Court's opinion in MedImmune represents a rejection 
of our reasonable apprehension of suit test.”). 
The court's ruling today negates this development, 
by unduly narrowing personal jurisdiction to bar an 
action that *1028 the Court has advised should be 
available under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Although 
undoubtedly there are circumstances in 
which a foreign patent owner can properly avoid 
jurisdiction, here the foreign patentee is actively 
and forcefully using its United States patents in a 
competitive context within the forum of this suit. 
Equity favors the reasonableness of permitting 
Autogenomics to resolve the threat, instead of continuing 
to face the uncertainty of liability and business 
risk, at the whim of the patent owner. 

This is not a trivial question. The PTO reports 
that 50.3% of the patents granted in 2008 were issued 
to foreign patentees. See USPTO, Extended 
Year Set-Historic Patents By Country, State, and 
Year-All Patent Types (December 2008), available 
at http:// www. uspto. gov/ web/ offices/ ac/ ido/ 
oeip/ taf/ cst_ allh. htm. Thus restriction on the 
availability of declaratory judgment actions against 
foreign-owned patents is of economic significance. 
As this court stated in Viam, it cannot have been 
contemplated that activities otherwise subject to 
federal jurisdiction, are always immunized from adjudication 
when the patent owner's address is offshore. 
84 F.3d at 429-30. The panel majority asserts 
that, at a minimum, the United States District Court 
for the District of Columbia remains a fall-back forum, 
see 35 U.S.C. § 293. It is surely useful that the 
District of Columbia court can have jurisdiction “to 
take any action respecting the patent or rights thereunder.” 
Id. That is not the issue herein, nor does § 
293 override personal jurisdiction in a more suitable 
and convenient forum. See Deprenyl Animal

plaintiff should have to resort to a distant 
forum, which is not alleged to have meaningful 
contacts with either party, to resolve a dispute that 
centers upon actions by both the plaintiff and the 
foreign patentee in the state of California. I take 
note that Oxford has not suggested transfer to the

cannot be sued. 

The court's decision that Oxford cannot be

May 14, 2009. 


Background: Patent owner and exclusive licensee 
brought action against competitors alleging infringement 
of patent directed to active ingredient in 
antiulcer drug. After consolidating the cases, the 
United States District Court for the District of New 
Jersey, 532 F.Supp.2d 666,Jose L. Linares, J., 
denied owner and licensee's motion for a preliminary 
injunction. Owner and licensee appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Ward, District 
Judge, sitting by designation, held that: 

(1) district court's determination that alleged infringers' 
obviousness defense had substantial merit 
was not clearly erroneous, and 
(2) district court's determination that owner and licensee 
failed to demonstrate irreparable harm was 
not clearly erroneous. 
Affirmed.

In determining whether to grant a preliminary 
injunction, a court examines four factors: (1) a reasonable 
likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable 
harm if an injunction is not granted; (3) a 
balance of hardships tipping in its favor; and (4) the 
injunction's favorable impact on the public interest.

NEWMAN. 

WARD, District Judge. 

Plaintiffs-Appellants Altana Pharma AG and 
Wyeth (collectively, “Altana”) appeal the decision 
of the United States District Court for the District 
of New Jersey denying a preliminary injunction. 
Because the district court did not abuse its discretion, 
we affirm. 

I. BACKGROUND 
Appellants, Altana Pharma AG and Wyeth, accuse 
appellees, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. 
(“Teva”), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. 
(“Sun”), et al. (collectively, “Defendants”) of infringing 
U.S. Patent No. 4,758,579 (“the ' 579 patent”). 
Wyeth is the exclusive licensee of the '579 
patent in the United States. The '579 patent issued 
on February 9, 1988. On January 4, 2004, the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) granted a 
5-year term extension pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 156 
(“the Hatch-Waxman Act”); thus, the ' 579 patent 
expires on July 19, 2010. 

The '579 patent is directed to the compound 
pantoprazole, the active ingredient in Altana's anti-
ulcer drug Protonix ®. The compound pantoprazole 
belongs to a class of compounds known as proton 
pump inhibitors (“PPIs”) that are used to treat gastric 
acid disorders in the stomach. PPIs inhibit gastric 
acid secretion through their action on the gastric 
acid pump. When triggered by the body, the gastric 
acid pump is established in the secretory canaliculus 
of the stomach's parietal cells via the enzyme 
H +, K +-ATPase. Once triggered, the pump 
transports protons, H +, from the inside of the parietal 
cell into the cell's secretory canaliculus in exchange 
for potassium ions, K +, which the pump 
transports from the canaliculus to the inner portion 
of the cell. The availability of potassium ions within 
the canaliculus is attributable to the migration of 
potassium chloride, KCI, into the canaliculus, also 
from the inside of the parietal cell. As the pump reabsorbs 
the K + in exchange for H + extrusion, the 

-

CI remains in the canaliculus, resulting in the 
formation of hydrochloric acid, HCI, within the 
canaliculus, which is then secreted into the stomach. 


Although the operation of the gastric acid 
pump was known at the time of the invention at issue, 
the mechanism by which PPIs inhibit the gastric 
acid pump was not understood in the art until 
after the effective filing date of the ' 579 patent. 
Part of the uncertainty surrounding the method of 
action for PPIs is attributable to the fact *1003 that 
PPIs are prodrugs, which are drugs that convert to 
their active form after they are delivered within a 
patient's body, which typically exhibits a pH of 
about 5 to about 7. In this regard, PPIs are acid-
activated prodrugs that are converted into their active 
form in the highly acidic environment, having a 
pH of about 1, within the secretory canaliculus of 
parietal cells. Once converted to its active form, the 
PPI thereafter binds to one or more cysteine amino 
acids in the acid pump. This binding inhibits the 
operation of the gastric acid pump. 

The first commercialized PPI compound was 
omeprazole, which was approved for use by the 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 
1989 under the trade name Prilosec ®. Omeprazole 
was first synthesized by AB Hassle (now known as 
AstraZeneca) in 1979 and is the subject of U.S. Patent 
No. 4,255,431 (“the '431 patent”). Omeprazole 
or Prilosec ® is well known today as a blockbuster 
drug for the treatment of patients that suffer from 
heartburn, as well as other symptoms that stem 
from gastro-esophageal reflux disease (“GERD”). 
After the successful commercialization of Prilosec 
®, many drug companies, including Byk Gulden 
(Altana's predecessor), began to develop new PPIs 
to compete with omeprazole. 
Altana's research efforts resulted in the issuance 
of U.S. Patent No. 4,555,518 (“the '518 patent”) 
and the '579 patent. The application for the ' 
518 patent was filed before the '579 patent, and 
contained a pharmacology section that compared 
the effectiveness of 18 claimed compounds against

four prior art compounds. The '518 patent refers to 
one of the 18 compounds chosen for testing as compound 
12. The '579 patent, which is not related to 
the '518 patent, claims PPI compounds that are 
structurally similar to the compounds claimed in the 
'518 patent. Pantoprazole, the compound at issue in 
this litigation, exhibits a structure that is very similar 
to compound 12 from the '518 patent. 

There are three main structural elements to the PPI 
molecular backbone: the benzimidazole ring, the 
methylsulfinyl bridge, and the pyridine ring. The 
general formula of the PPI disclosed in the '579 patent 
is reproduced below: 


'579 patent at 2:5-15. The issues in this case 
primarily relate to the pyridine ring (the right-most 
structure on the above compound), specifically, the 
radicals located on the pyridine ring (indicated by 
R2, R3, and R4). The ' 579 patent teaches that “R3 
represents a 1-3C-alkoxy radical, one of the radicals 
R2 and R4 represents a 1-3C-alkoxy radical and 
the other represents a hydrogen atom (-H) or a 
1-3C-alkyl radical.” Id. at 2:28-31.

between compound 12 and pantoprazole is the substituent 
(or radical) at the 3-position of the pyridine 
ring. In compound 12, it is a methyl group (-CH),

group (-OCH).

On or about April 6, 2004, Teva filed an Abbreviated 
New Drug Application (“ANDA”) pursuant 
to the Hatch-Waxman Act, requesting FDA approval 
to sell a generic version of Protonix ® prior 
to the expiration of the '579 patent. Sun filed similarly 
directed ANDA applications on or about 

March 1, 2005, and June 25, 2005. Both Teva and 
Sun filed paragraph IV certifications in conjunction 
with their respective ANDA applications. Following 
the submission of these ANDA applications, 
Altana filed suit against Teva and, subsequently, 
against Sun. The district court consolidated these 
cases. 

Altana filed a motion for preliminary injunction 
on June 22, 2007. In opposition to this motion, 
both Teva and Sun conceded infringement; 
however, they maintained that the '579 patent is in


FN1

valid.Specifically, the defendants argued that 
the '579 patent was obvious in light of the teachings 
in the following prior art references: (1) Altana's ' 

FN2

518 patent, (2) the Sachs article,(3) the Bryson 

FN3

article,and (4) the '431 patent (covering 
omeprazole). 

FN1. On appeal, Sun raises another invalidity 
defense, obviousness-type double 
patenting, in addition to a statutory obviousness 
defense. Although the double patenting 
issue was briefed to the district 
court in connection with Altana's motion 
for preliminary injunction, the district 
court did not address it. Assuming, arguendo, 
that this issue is properly before 
this court, our disposition of this case

(1960). 

In the district court, the defendants' obviousness 
analysis focused on the selection of compound 
12 from the '518 patent as a lead compound for 
modification. The defendants argued that the Sachs 
article provided motivation for one of skill in the 
art to lower the pKa of a PPI to a value of 4 in order 
to provide better stability of the compound in the 
patient's body. The pKa value of a compound is 
measured on a logarithmic scale, and indicates the 
degree of the willingness of the compound to accept 
or donate a proton. The lower the numerical 
pKa of a compound, the more acidic and less basic 
it is. Thus, at pH 5, a compound with a pKa of 4 
would be more stable than the compound with a 
pKa of 5. The defendants' position was that Sachs 
taught that a pKa value of 4 was a desirable characteristic 
in a PPI because it would improve the stability 
of a PPI in the body prior to its introduction 
to the parietal cells of the stomach. The defendants 
further argued that the Bryson article taught how to 
lower the pKa value. In particular, they argued that 
Bryson taught that a methoxy group at the 
3-position of a pyridine ring provides a lower pKa 
than a methyl group in that same position. Finally, 
the defendants argued that the '431 patent demonstrated 
the feasibility of substituting a methoxy 
group for a methyl group at the 3-position of the 
pyridine ring in a PPI. 

The district court held a hearing to address 
Altana's motion for preliminary injunction. After 
considering the evidence and the arguments, the 

district court denied the requested relief. With respect 
to the likelihood of success on the merits, the 
district court found that the defendants had demonstrated 
a substantial question of invalidity and the 
plaintiffs had not shown that it lacked substantial 
merit. In particular, the court found that one of skill 
in the art would have selected compound 12 as a 
*1005 lead compound for modification. Next, the 
court agreed with the defendants' interpretation of 
the Sachs reference, and found that it provided motivation 
to one of skill in the art to modify compound 
12 to achieve a pKa of 4. The district court 
also found that the Bryson article taught that a compound 
with a methoxy group in the 3-position of a 
pyridine ring, as opposed to a methyl group in that 
position, would lower the pKa value to a pKa of 4. 
That court also relied on the '431 patent to show 
that such a substitution was feasible. The district 
court's examination of the objective indicia of non-
obviousness did not cause it to disregard the prima 
facie showing of obviousness, and the court accordingly 
found that Altana failed to establish a likelihood 
of success on the merits. 

The district court also considered, but rejected, 
Altana's position on irreparable harm. Altana argued 
that the following harms would be irreparable 
if no preliminary injunction was issued: irreversible 
price erosion, substantial loss of profits, decrease in 
market share, inability to service debts, employee 
layoffs, and loss of research opportunities. The district 
court found that these harms were not irreparable 
and that the defendants would be able to satisfy 
a judgment should Altana prevail at trial. As a 
result, the district court concluded that Altana had 
failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm 
if the injunction was not issued. 

Based on Altana's failure to establish either a 
likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable 
harm, the district court denied the motion for preliminary 
injunction. This appeal followed. We have 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(c)(1).

ary injunction is within the sound discretion of the 
district court. See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. Andrx 
Pharms., Inc., 452 F.3d 1331, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2006). 
An appellant carries a heavier burden when seeking 
to reverse the denial of a preliminary injunction 
than seeking to reverse the grant of a preliminary 
injunction. New England Braiding Co., Inc. v. A.W. 
Chesterton Co., 970 F.2d 878, 882 (Fed.Cir.1992) ( 
“When a preliminary injunction is denied, the 
movant ... must show not only that one or more of 
the factors relied on by the district court was clearly 
erroneous, but also that a denial of the preliminary 
relief sought would amount to an abuse of the 
court's discretion upon reversal of an erroneous 
finding.”). 

[3][4] To obtain a preliminary injunction, a 
court examines four factors: 

(1) a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits; 
(2) irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted; 
(3) a balance of hardships tipping in its favor; 
and 
(4) the injunction's favorable impact on the public 
interest. 
See Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, 
Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing 
Reebok Int'l Ltd. v. J. Baker, Inc., 32 F.3d 1552, 
1555 (Fed.Cir.1994)). Although the factors are not 
applied mechanically, a movant must establish the 
existence of both of the first two factors to be entitled 
to a preliminary injunction. Amazon, 239 F.3d 
at 1350. 

A. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS 
[5][6] A patent holder seeking a preliminary injunction 
bears the ultimate burden of establishing a 
likelihood of success on the merits with respect to 
the patent's validity. Entegris, Inc. v. Pall Corp., 
490 F.3d 1340, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2007). If the alleged 

infringer raises a “substantial question”*1006 of invalidity, 
the preliminary injunction should not issue. 
Id; Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 108 
F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir.1997). The burden on the 
accused infringer to show a substantial question of 
invalidity at this stage is lower than what is required 
to prove invalidity at trial. “Vulnerability is 
the issue at the preliminary injunction stage, while 
validity is the issue at trial.” Amazon.com, 239 F.3d 
at 1359 (“In resisting a preliminary injunction ... 
one need not make out a case of actual invalidity.... 
The showing of a substantial question as to invalidity 
thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing 
showing necessary to establish invalidity itself.”). 
Once the accused infringer satisfies this requirement, 
the burden shifts to the patentee to show 
that the defense lacks substantial merit. Entegris, 
490 F.3d at 1351. 

Altana argues that the following alleged errors 
require the reversal of the district court's order 
denying the preliminary injunction: (1) the district 
court's failure to take into account an accused infringer's 
clear and convincing burden to prove invalidity; 
(2) the district court's selection of compound 
12 as a lead compound; and (3) the district 
court's interpretation of the Bryson article. 

1. Burden of Proof 
Altana first argues that the district court applied 
an incorrect standard in assessing whether 
Altana had shown a likelihood of success on the 
merits. The district court set forth the standard it 
applied: “In order to establish likelihood of success 
on the merits, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants' 
invalidity defenses lack substantial merit. In other 
words, if Defendants have raised a substantial question 
of invalidity, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary 
injunction.” (citations omitted). 

According to Altana, the standard articulated 
by the district court incorrectly placed the burden 
on Altana to show that the obviousness defense 
lacks substantial merit, rather than putting the burden 
on the defendants to establish a substantial 
question of invalidity. In Abbott Laboratories, the

566 F.3d 999, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1018 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 999) 

majority opinion specifically addressed the issue of 
this court's precedent with respect to the burden of 
showing a likelihood of success in the face of an attack 
on the validity of a patent. Abbott Labs., 452 
F.3d at 1334 n. 2 (“The majority opinion ... is duty 
bound by our precedent which states exactly this 
proposition.”). The precedent of this court holds 
that if the accused infringer “raises a ‘substantial 
question’ concerning validity, enforceability, or infringement 
(i.e., asserts a defense that [the movant] 
cannot show ‘lacks substantial merit’) the preliminary 
injunction should not issue.” Genentech, 108 
F.3d at 1364 (citing New England Braiding, 970 
F.2d at 882-83); see also Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 
1350-51. More recently, the court applied this 
standard in Entegris. 490 F.3d at 1351. The district 
court did not apply a legally incorrect standard, and 
we reject Altana's first argument. 

2. District Court's Obviousness Analysis 
[7] Altana challenges the district court's obviousness 
analysis on the merits. Altana argues that 
the district court clearly erred when it determined 
that the defendants' obviousness defense had substantial 
merit. In particular, Altana argues that the 
district court allowed the defendants to select compound 
12 of the '518 patent as a lead compound 
when the prior art suggested the availability of numerous 
other compounds that were at least as promising 
to modify as compound 12. In addition, 
Altana contends that the district court's findings 
with respect to the teaching*1007 of Bryson are 
clearly erroneous. We examine each argument. 
[8][9][10] Obviousness is ultimately a question 
of law, based on underlying factual determinations. 
Richardson-Vicks Inc. v. Upjohn Co., 122 F.3d 
1476, 1479 (Fed.Cir.1997). The factual determinations 
that form the basis of the legal conclusion of 
obviousness include (1) the scope and content of 
the prior art; (2) the level of ordinary skill in the 
art; (3) the differences between the claimed invention 
and the prior art; and (4) evidence of secondary 
factors, known as objective indicia of non-
obviousness. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 

1, 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). This 
court recently explained that “[w]here, as here, the 
patent at issue claims a chemical compound, the 
analysis of the third Graham factor (the differences 
between the claimed invention and the prior art) often 
turns on the structural similarities and differences 
between the claimed compound and the prior 
art.” Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs., Ltd., 533 
F.3d 1353, 1356-57 (Fed.Cir.2008). Thus, to establish 
a prima facie case of obviousness in cases involving 
new chemical compounds, the accused infringer 
must identify some reason that would have 
led a chemist to modify a known compound in a 
particular manner. See Yamanouchi Pharm. Co., 
Ltd. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 231 F.3d 1339, 
1344 (Fed.Cir.2000). This standard is consistent 
with the legal principles announced in the Supreme 
Court's decision in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 
550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 
(2007). See Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm 
Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1356 
(Fed.Cir.2007); Eisai, 533 F.3d at 1359 (“In other 
words, post-KSR, a prima facie case of obviousness 
for a chemical compound still, in general, begins 
with the reasoned identification of a lead compound.”). 


[11][12] Obviousness based on structural similarity 
may be proven by the identification of some 
motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill 
in the art to select and modify a known compound 
in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound. 
Eisai, 533 F.3d at 1357. The requisite motivation 
can come from any number of sources and 
need not necessarily be explicit in the art. Id. (citing 
Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd., 
499 F.3d 1293, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2007)). Instead, “it is 
sufficient to show that the claimed and prior art 
compounds possess a ‘sufficiently close relationship 
... to create an expectation,’ in light of the totality 
of the prior art, that the new compound will 
have ‘similar properties' to the old.” Id. (quoting In 
re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692 (Fed.Cir.1990) (en 
banc)).

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 999) 

Our review of the district court's decision is 
limited, and it is important to place the district 
court's findings in perspective. Applications for 
preliminary injunctions are typically presented on 
an abbreviated record without the benefit of a full 
trial. In this case, the district court carefully explained 
that its obviousness findings were preliminary. 
In the district court, the defendants attempted 
to prove that the claims were vulnerable because 
one of skill in the art would have selected a number 
of compounds disclosed in the '518 patent, including 
compound 12, as a starting point for further development. 
Based on the record before it, the district 
court found that “Defendants have raised a 
substantial argument that compound 12 was a natural 
choice for further development in this regard.” 

Ample evidence supported this finding. First, 
the '518 patent claimed that its compounds, including 
compound 12, were improvements over the prior 
art, specifically omeprazole (the first successful 
PPI). In addition, compound 12 was disclosed as 
*1008 one of the more potent of the eighteen compounds 
of the '518 patent for which data was 
provided during prosecution. Moreover, the patent 
examiner relied on the compounds of the '518 patent 
during the prosecution of the '579 patent. Cf. 
Eisai, 533 F.3d at 1357 (“Indeed, Teva's pharmacology 
expert ... declined to opine on lansoprazole's 
relevance to an examiner assessing the patentability 
of rabeprazole.”). 

Beyond this evidence, the district court considered 
the opinions of qualified experts. The defendants 
supported their obviousness argument with 
the Declaration of Prof. Lester A. Mitscher, Ph.D. 
Dr. Mitscher was amply qualified to express opinions 
on the subject matter involved in this case. Dr. 
Mitscher expressed his opinion that Altana's '518 
patent (which disclosed compound 12) was “on the 
cutting edge of PPI development in June 1984.” Dr. 
Mitscher provided the district court with an overview 
of the history of PPIs and the state of the art 
as of June 1984. In particular, Dr. Mitscher stated 
that one of skill in the art would have selected the 

18 exemplary compounds (including compound 12) 
of the '518 patent over omeprazole from which to 
pursue further development efforts designed to improve 
the quality and effectiveness of PPIs. Although 
Altana's expert suggested that one of skill in 
the art would have selected omeprazole over the 
compounds of the '518 patent, in part because of 
toxicity concerns, the district court apparently accepted 
Dr. Mitscher's contrary opinion. The district 
court's reliance on Dr. Mitscher's opinion was not 
clearly erroneous. 

Beyond the finding that those of skill in the art 
would have pursued the 18 exemplary compounds 
in the '518 patent, the district court also found that 
one of skill in the art would have found compound 
12, in particular, a natural choice for further development 
efforts. This finding is supported by evidence 
that compound 12 was one of the more potent 
PPI compounds disclosed in the '518 patent. Although 
potency is not dispositive, the district court 
believed-not unreasonably-that the potency of the 
compound was a factor that would have led one of 
skill in the art to select compound 12 from the 
group for further study. It bears mention that Altana 
itself had selected compound 12 for further development 
efforts, although the inventor stated that he 
ultimately developed pantoprazole by using an unwanted 
by-product from his scale up work as a 
starting point, rather than compound 12. 

Altana suggests that the prior art would not 
have directed one of skill in the art to select compound 
12 over the approximately 90 compounds 
claimed to be improvements in the '518 and other 
prior art patents, or, for that matter, over the thousands 
of other compounds included in the prior art 
disclosures. In light of Dr. Mitscher's declaration, 
however, the district court had a sufficient evidentiary 
basis for rejecting that position. Moreover, to 
the extent Altana suggests that the prior art must 
point to only a single lead compound for further development 
efforts, that restrictive view of the lead 
compound test would present a rigid test similar to 
the teaching-suggestion-motivation test that the Su

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 999) 

preme Court explicitly rejected in KSR. Cf. KSR, 
550 U.S. at 419, 127 S.Ct. 1727 (“The obviousness 
analysis cannot be confined by a formalistic conception 
of the words teaching, suggestion, and motivation, 
or by overemphasis on the importance of 
published articles and the explicit content of issued 
patents. The diversity of inventive pursuits and of 
modern technology counsels against limiting the 
analysis in this way.”). The district court in this 
case employed a flexible approach-one that was admittedly 
preliminary-and found that the defendants 
had raised a substantial*1009 question that one of 
skill in the art would have used the more potent 
compounds of the '518 patent, including compound 
12, as a starting point from which to pursue further 
development efforts. That finding was not clearly 
erroneous. 

The district court determined that the Sachs article 
taught those of skill in the art that an effective 
PPI should have a pKa of 4 because a pKa of 4 
would lead to better stability of the compound within 
the body. Thus, according to the district court, 
one of skill in the art would have been motivated to 
modify the prior art compounds to reduce their pKa 
to 4. It is not disputed that the author of the Sachs 
article, Dr. George Sachs, is one of the leading researchers 
in the PPI development field. As such, the 
district court was entirely justified in selecting the 
Sachs article as relevant prior art. Moreover, although 
Altana disputed the teachings of Sachs before 
the district court, Altana does not challenge on 
appeal the district court's findings with respect to 
the Sachs teachings. Instead, Altana contends that 
the district court made a factual error in interpreting 
the Bryson article which requires reversal. We now 
turn to that issue. 

The Bryson article teaches the pKa values of 
various chemical groups, including methoxy 
groups, at the 3-position of a simple pyridine ring. 
The defendants argued that Bryson taught that a 
methoxy group at the 3-position of the pyridine ring 
would have a lower pKa value than if it had a 
methyl group at that position. The district court ac


cepted this argument, but stated “[a]ccording to 
Bryson, the pKa value of a methoxy group at such a 
position is 4; however, the pKa of a methyl group at 
this position is 5.” The district court also stated: 
“Bryson undisputably taught that a compound with 
a methoxy group at the 3 position of the pyridine 
ring would have a lower pKa value (namely a pKa 
of 4) that [sic] a compound with a methyl group at 
that position.” The district court concluded that 
“[w]hen Bryson's teachings are combined with the 
structure of compound 12 and combined with Dr. 
Sachs's teachings, Defendants have raised a substantial 
question that this combination was at the 
very least obvious to try and that such would lead 
to a predictable variation of compound 12, i.e., a 
compound with better pH5 stability.” 

Altana correctly points out that the district 
court's findings that Bryson discloses lowering the 
pKa to 4 through the substitution of a methoxy 
group are in error. Bryson actually discloses values 
of 4.83 and 4.91 for simple pyridine rings containing 
a methoxy group in the 3-position. Because pKa 
values are measured on a logarithmic scale, there is 
a very substantial mathematical difference in the 
magnitude of a pKa value of 4 versus a pKa value 
of 4.83. A value of 4.83 is over 6.7 times larger 
than a value of 4. 

This error, however, does not require reversal 
unless Altana also shows that the district court's 
denial of the requested injunction was an abuse of 
discretion. New England Braiding Co., 970 F.2d at 

882. Notwithstanding the district court's statements, 
the declaration of Dr. Mitscher clearly does not 
make such an error in its analysis of the Bryson reference. 
Rather, the evidence presented by the defendants 
supports a finding that one of skill in the 
art would read Bryson to teach the lowering of a 
pKa through the substitution of a methoxy group 
for a methyl group at the 3-position of the pyridine 
ring. 
Dr. Mitscher stated that “Bryson indicates that 
the addition of a methoxy group at the 3-position 
decreases the pKa of pyridine by 0.27-0.35 pKa

566 F.3d 999, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1018 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 999) 

units (with an average pKa for 3-methoxy pyridine 
of 4.87).” Consistent with Dr. Mitscher's *1010 
statements, the Bryson article discloses precisely 
that. The expert also accurately described Bryson's 
disclosure of the pKa values of the pyridine ring 
with a methyl group at the 3-position: “Bryson indicates 
that the addition of a methyl group at the 
3-position of pyridine increases the pKa of pyridine 
by 0.34-0.53 pKa units (with an average pKa for 
3-methyl pyridine of 5.66 compared to an average 
pKa of 5.18 for unsubstituted pyridine).” Thus, the 
difference in the average pKa values of methyl and 
methoxy substituted pyridine rings disclosed by 
Bryson is 0.79. 

Under Bryson, the pKa of the methoxy substituted 
pyridine ring is substantially lower than the 
methyl substituted pyridine ring. The district court's 
references to pKa values of “5” and “4,” although 
not technically accurate, in fact correlate with the 
difference in magnitude of the pKa values of the 
substituted pyridines described in Bryson. Indeed, 
elsewhere in the district court's opinion, the court 
stated that “if Sachs teaches pH5 stability via 
lowering the pKa of the pyridine ring, and Bryson 
teaches how to lower such pKa, then the purportedly 
unexpected property of pantoprazole is in 
fact an expected property.” The defendants as well 
as the district court understood that the obviousness 
position depended on Bryson's teaching of a way to 
substantially lower the pKa value of the pyridine 

FN4

ring.The evidence thus supports the district 
court's overriding decision that the defendants had 
made out a sufficient case of obviousness to defer 
the matter for trial on the merits, as opposed to 
granting the preliminary relief sought by the 
plaintiffs. Moreover, the district court found that 
Altana had failed to prove irreparable harm. As we 
shall explain, that finding is not clearly erroneous 
and under this court's precedent is a prerequisite for 
preliminary relief. Accordingly, although we agree 
with Altana that some of the district court's findings 
with respect to Bryson were incorrect, we do not 
disturb the district court's decision on this ground. 

FN4. We also find sufficient evidentiary 
support for the district court's implicit 
finding that Bryson's discussion relating to 
simple pyridine rings would have been relevant 
to a medicinal chemist designing a 
PPI. 

B. IRREPARABLE HARM 
[13] On appeal, Altana argues that the district 
court abused its discretion when it found that 
Altana had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. 
The district court supported its findings on irreparable 
harm by stating that the plaintiffs had not 
shown that the defendants were unable to respond 
in money damages, that the harms to the defendants 
were exaggerated, and that Altana likely had a business 
plan in place to deal with the launch of generic 
competition. The district court also had difficulty 
accepting the fact that Nycomed, which purchased 
Altana during the pendency of this case, had failed 
to account for potential generic launches. 
Altana argues that the district court committed 
a legal error by categorically dismissing certain 
harms-price erosion, loss of market share, loss of 
profits, loss of research opportunities and possible 
layoffs-that Altana would suffer as not irreparable. 
Altana's primary contention is that the district court 
incorrectly stated that the types of harms are as a 
matter of law not irreparable. The district court 
stated: “the Federal Circuit, as well as courts in this 
district, have declared that the types of harms advanced 
by Plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit are not irreparable 
and thus, cannot form the basis for granting 
an injunction.” 

*1011 Altana views the district court's statement 
in isolation, but a careful review of the district 
court's entire analysis on this point reveals that the 
district court correctly understood that this court 
has upheld findings of irreparable harm based on 
these very factors. See Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, 
Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2006) 
(affirming the district courts finding of irreparable 
harm based, in part, on price erosion). Far from 
supporting a reversal of this case, the law cited by

566 F.3d 999, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1018 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 999) 

the district court highlights this court's deference to 
a district court's determination whether a movant 
has sufficiently shown irreparable harm. Compare 
id. with Eli Lilly & Co. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 82 
F.3d 1568, 1578-79 (Fed.Cir.1996) (affirming the 
district court's finding that the movant failed to establish 
irreparable harm based, in part, on the loss 
of research opportunities). Here, we find no error in 
the district court's findings that these harms are not 
irreparable to Altana. 

Altana further argues that the district court 
erred in weighing Altana's awareness of the future 
harm it would incur at the expiration of the Hatch-
Waxman Act stay, which followed the filing of the 
defendants' ANDA applications. The district court, 
however, did not directly rely on these facts to 
show that Altana would not be irreparably harmed. 
Rather, the district court found that Altana's argument 
that its business would be crushed by the 
entry of generic versions of Protonix ® was exaggerated 
in light of the expiration of the Hatch


FN5

Waxman stay.The manner in which the district 
court addressed the credibility of Altana's argument 
regarding the impact of generic versions entering 
the market on Altana's business was not clearly erroneous. 


FN5. In the July 31, 2007 hearing conducted 
by the district court, Altana's counsel 
unequivocally stated that neither it nor its 
partners had any plans to launch a generic 
version of Protonix ®, “not under any 
guise.” In counsel's exchange with the district 
court, he admitted to the district court 
that if Altana launched its own generic, “it 
would be a different analysis.” According 
to the briefing before this court, however, 
Altana did just that. Subsequent to the district 
court's denial of Altana's motion for 
preliminary injunction, Altana's licensee, 
Wyeth, launched a generic version of Protonix 
®. 

III. CONCLUSION 
For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm. 
AFFIRMED 

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring. 

In view of the discretionary weight that must 
be given to a district court's decision with respect to 
whether to grant a plaintiffs request for relief pendente 
lite, I concur in the court's affirmance of the 
district court's denial of the injunction. Although 
the evidence presented to the district court does not, 
in my view, establish invalidity of the patent on the 
pharmaceutical product pantoprazole, see, 
Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao 
do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 
L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006) (“the burdens at the preliminary 
injunction stage track the burdens at trial.”) at 
this preliminary stage deference is warranted to the 
district court's weighing of the conflicting expert 
opinions interpreting the evidence. On this basis, I 
concur in sustaining this discretionary action.

F.Supp.2d 476, in a bench trial, entered judgment in 
favor of patent owner. Competitor appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Huff, District 
Judge, sitting by designation, held that: 

(1) district court did not clearly err in finding that 
competitor failed to establish prima facie case of 
obviousness; 
(2) district court did not commit clear error in concluding 
that secondary considerations supported a 
finding of non-obviousness of patent claiming 
risedronate; 
(3) patent claiming an intermittent dosing method 
for treating osteoporosis qualified as prior art; and 
(4) patent claiming risedronate was not invalid 
based on obviousness-type double patenting. 
Affirmed.

retards progress; in other cases, though,

either no indication of which parameters are critical

Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) appeals 
from a final judgment of the United States 
District Court for the District of Delaware in favor 
of The Procter & Gamble Company (“P & G”) in 
three cases upholding the validity of P & G's U.S. 
Patent 5,583,122 (the “'122 patent ”). Procter & 
Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., 
536 F.Supp.2d 476 (D.Del.2008). After a bench trial 
and a stipulation for judgment in the related 
cases, the district court rejected Teva's invalidity 
defenses of obviousness and obviousness-type 
double patenting. We affirm. 

I. BACKGROUND 
The '122 patent claims the compound risedronate, 
the active ingredient of P & G's osteoporosis 
drug Actonel®. In August 2004, P & G sued Teva 
for infringement of the '122 patent after Teva notified 
P & G that it planned to market risedronate as 
a generic equivalent of Actonel®. Specifically, P & 
G alleged that Teva's proposed drug infringed claim 

4 of the '122 patent for the compound risedronate, 
claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing 
risedronate, and claim 23 for methods of 
treating diseases using risedronate. In its defense, 
Teva argued that the '122 *993 patent was invalid 
as obvious in light of P & G's expired U.S. Patent 
4,761,406 (the “'406 patent”), filed on June 6, 1985 
and issued on August 2, 1988. Alternately, Teva argues 
that the '122 patent is invalid for obviousness-
type double patenting. 

Risedronate, the subject of the contested 
claims, is a member of a group of compounds referred 
to as bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates, in 
general, are active in inhibiting bone resorption. 
The first two promising bisphosphonates studied 
for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases, etidronate 
(EHDP) and clodronate, had clinical problems 
which prevented their commercialization. P & G 
conducted a significant amount of experimentation 
involving hundreds of different bisphosphonate 
compounds, but could not predict the efficacy or 
toxicity of the new compounds. Eventually, researchers 
at P & G identified risedronate as a promising 
drug candidate. 

On December 6, 1985, risedronate's inventors 
applied for a patent on the compound. P & G is the 
owner by assignment of the '122 patent, entitled “ 
Pharmaceutical Compositions Containing Geminal 
Diphosphonates,” which issued on December 10, 
1996. 

Risedronate is neither claimed nor disclosed in 
the '406 patent. Instead, the '406 patent, entitled 
“Regimen for Treating Osteoporosis,” claims an intermittent 
dosing method for treating osteoporosis. 
As the trial court noted, the '406 patent “addresses 
the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the 
time, namely that they inhibited bone mineralization, 
by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative 
regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect 
of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of 
anti-mineralization in patients.” Procter & Gamble, 
536 F.Supp.2d at 492. The ' 406 patent lists thirty-
six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment can

didates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent 
dosing, including 2-pyr EHDP. Teva contends 
that the structural similarities between risedronate 
and 2-pyr EHDP render the challenged claims of 
the '122 patent obvious. 

From the testimony at trial, the district court 
concluded that the ' 406 patent would not have led a 
person of ordinary skill in the art to identify 2-pyr 
EHDP as the lead compound. In light of the extremely 
unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at 
the time of the invention, the district court also 
found that a person of ordinary skill in the art 
would not have been motivated to make the specific 
molecular modifications to make risedronate. The 
district court concluded that unexpected results of 
risedronate's potency and toxicity rebut a claim of 
obviousness. The district court found that secondary 
considerations of non-obviousness supported its 
conclusions. Similarly, the court found that the '122 
patent was not invalid for obviousness-type double 
patenting. This consolidated appeal followed. We 
have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1295(a)(1).

F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.Cir.2004). Whether the subject 
matter of a patent is obvious is a question of 
law and is reviewed de novo. PharmaStem Therapeutics, 
Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 1359 
(Fed.Cir.2007). Factual determinations underlying 
the obviousness issue are reviewed for clear error. 
Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 464 F.3d 1286, 
1289 (Fed.Cir.2006). The evidentiary burden to 
show facts supporting a *994 conclusion of invalidity 
is one of clear and convincing evidence. AK 
Steel Corp. v. Sollac & Ugine, 344 F.3d 1234, 
1238-39 (Fed.Cir.2003). Non-statutory double patenting 
is a legal question reviewed without deference. 
Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 

195 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed.Cir.1999). 

II. Patent Obviousness-Legal Standard 
[6][7] Under the U.S. Patent Act, an invention 
cannot be patented if “the subject matter as a whole 
would have been obvious at the time the invention 
was made to a person having ordinary skill in the 
art to which said subject matter pertains.” 35 U.S.C. 
§ 103(a). Patents are presumed to be valid. Kao 
Corp. v. Unilever U.S., Inc., 441 F.3d 963, 968 
(Fed.Cir.2006). A party seeking to invalidate a patent 
based on obviousness must demonstrate “by 
clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan 
would have been motivated to combine the teachings 
of the prior art references to achieve the 
claimed invention, and that the skilled artisan 
would have had a reasonable expectation of success 
in doing so.” Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 
1348, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2007). Clear and convincing 
evidence places in the fact finder “an abiding conviction 
that the truth of [the] factual contentions are 
highly probable.” Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 

U.S. 310, 316, 104 S.Ct. 2433, 81 L.Ed.2d 247 
(1984) (quotation marks omitted). 
[8][9] The obviousness determination turns on 
underlying factual inquiries involving: (1) the scope 
and content of prior art, (2) differences between 
claims and prior art, (3) the level of ordinary skill 
in pertinent art, and (4) secondary considerations 
such as commercial success and satisfaction of a 
long-felt need. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 

U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). 
The Supreme Court has explained that the Federal 
Circuit's “teaching, suggestion or motivation” test 
provides helpful insight into the obviousness question 
as long as it is not applied rigidly. KSR Int'l 
Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 
1741, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). Accordingly, under 
KSR, “it remains necessary to identify some reason 
that would have led a chemist to modify a known 
compound in a particular manner to establish prima 
facie obviousness of a new claimed compound.” 
Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., 
Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2007).

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989) 

[10] If a patent challenger makes a prima facie 
showing of obviousness, the owner may rebut based 
on “unexpected results” by demonstrating “that the 
claimed invention exhibits some superior property 
or advantage that a person of ordinary skill in the 
relevant art would have found surprising or unexpected.” 
In re Soni, 54 F.3d 746, 750 
(Fed.Cir.1995). We consider the relevant factors in 
turn. 
III. Identification of a Lead Compound 
[11] An obviousness argument based on structural 
similarity between claimed and prior art compounds 
“clearly depends on a preliminary finding 
that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected 
[the prior art compound] as a lead compound.” 
Takeda, 492 F.3d at 1359; see also Eisai 
Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs., Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353, 
1359 (Fed.Cir.2008) (stating that “post-KSR, a 
prima facie case of obviousness for a chemical 
compound still, in general, begins with the reasoned 
identification of a lead compound” in the prior art). 
Teva argues that the '406 patent identifies 2-pyr 
EHDP as the most promising molecule for the inhibition 
of bone resorption. The trial court disagreed 
and concluded from the evidence that a *995 
person of ordinary skill in the art would not have 
identified 2-pyr EHDP as a lead compound for the 
treatment of osteoporosis. 
We need not reach this question because we 
conclude that even if 2-pyr EHDP was a lead compound, 
the evidence does not establish that it would 
have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at 
the time of the invention to modify 2-pyr EHDP to 
create risedronate. 

IV. Obviousness of Risedronate in Light of the 
Prior Art 
[12] To decide whether risedronate was obvious 
in light of the prior art, a court must determine 
whether, at the time of invention, a person having 
ordinary skill in the art would have had “reason to 
attempt to make the composition” known as risedronate 
and “a reasonable expectation of success in 
doing so.” PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. Via-
Cell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007). 

The district court concluded that, even if 2-pyr 
EHDP were a lead compound, it would not render 
the '122 patent's claims on risedronate obvious because 
a person having ordinary skill in the art 
would not have had reason to make risedronate 
based on the prior art. The district court's findings 
also support the conclusion that there could have 
been no reasonable expectation as to risedronate's 
success. 

[13] The question of obviousness “often turns 
on the structural similarities and differences 
between the claimed compound and the prior art 
compound[ ].” Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs., 
Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353, 1356-57 (Fed.Cir.2008); see 
also Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d 
1075, 1086 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“Precedent establishes 
the analytical procedure whereby a close structural 
similarity between a new chemical compound and 
prior art compounds is generally deemed to create a 
prima facie case of obviousness....”); In re Mayne, 
104 F.3d 1339, 1343 (Fed.Cir.1997) ( “Structural 
relationships often provide the requisite motivation 
to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds.”); 
In re Payne, 606 F.2d 303, 313-15 
(CCPA 1979) (discussing the presumption of obviousness 
based on close structural similarity). In this 
case, risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP are positional 
isomers; they each contain the same atoms arranged 
in different ways. In risedronate, the hydroxyethanediphosphonate 
group is connected to the # 3 
carbon of a pyridine ring, while in 2-pyr EHDP, the 
hydroxy-ethane-diphosphonate group is connected 
to the # 2 carbon. Because the nitrogen atom is in a 
different position in the two molecules, they differ 
in three dimensional shape, charge distribution and 
hydrogen bonding properties. 
[14][15][16] To successfully argue that a new 
compound is obvious, the challenger may show 
“that the prior art would have suggested making the 
specific molecular modifications necessary to 
achieve the claimed invention.” Takeda, 492 F.3d 
at 1356 (quotation marks omitted). “In keeping

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989) 

with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry, 
the requisite motivation [to modify] can come from 
any number of sources.” Eisai, 533 F.3d at 1357 
(citation omitted). Thus, in addition to structural 
similarity between the compounds, a prima facie 
case of obviousness may be shown by “adequate 
support in the prior art” for the change in structure. 

In re Grabiak, 769 F.2d 729, 731-32 (Fed.Cir.1985) 
. As we noted in Takeda: 

A known compound may suggest its homolog, 
analog, or isomer because such compounds often 
have similar properties and therefore chemists of 
ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making 
them to try to obtain compounds with *996 
improved properties.... [However,] it remains necessary 
to identify some reason that would have 
led a chemist to modify a known compound in a 
particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness 
of a new claimed compound. 

492 F.3d at 1356-57 (citation omitted). 

At trial, P & G's expert witnesses testified that, 
in 1985, a person having ordinary skill in the art 
realized that the properties of bisphosphonates 
could not be anticipated based on their structure. 
Additionally, the trial court relied on contemporaneous 
writings from Herbert Fleisch, the preeminent 
authority on bisphosphonates during the relevant 
time period. Dr. Fleisch wrote in 1984 that “every 
compound, while remaining a bisphosphonate, exhibits 
its own physical-chemical, biological and 
therapeutic characteristics, so that each bisphosphonate 
has to be considered on its own. To infer 
from one compound the effects in another is dangerous 
and can be misleading.” Herbert Fleisch, 
Chemistry and Mechanisms of Action of Bisphosphonates, 
in Bone Resorption, Metastasis, and Diphosphonates 
33-40 (S. Garattini ed., 1985). In this 
case, P & G synthesized and tested 2-pyr EHDP, 
risedronate (3-pyr EHDP) and 4-pyr EHDP, another 
structural isomer. Confirming the unpredictability 
of bisphosphonates, test results for 4-pyr EHDP revealed 
that it was not active in inhibiting bone resorption 
despite its close relationship with potent 

compounds. In light of the Supreme Court's instruction 
in KSR, the Federal Circuit has stated that, 
“[t]o the extent an art is unpredictable, as the chemical 
arts often are, KSR's focus on [ ] ‘identified, 
predictable solutions' may present a difficult hurdle 
because potential solutions are less likely to be 
genuinely predictable.” Eisai, 533 F.3d 1353, 1359 
(quoting KSR, 127 S.Ct. at 1742). The district court 
found that Teva failed to clear that hurdle, establishing 
insufficient motivation for a person of ordinary 
skill to synthesize and test risedronate. This 
finding was not clearly erroneous. 

[17] Additionally, there was an insufficient 
showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art 
would have had a “reasonable expectation of success” 
in synthesizing and testing risedronate. PharmaStem, 
491 F.3d at 1360. In KSR, the Supreme 
Court stated that when an obvious modification 
“leads to the anticipated success,” the invention is 
likely the product of ordinary skill and is obvious 
under 35 U.S.C. § 103. 127 S.Ct. at 1742. 
“[O]bviousness cannot be avoided simply by a 
showing of some degree of unpredictability in the 
art so long as there was a reasonable probability of 
success.” Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364 (citing In re 
Corkill, 771 F.2d 1496, 1500 (Fed.Cir.1985)). Here, 
the district court's findings indicate that there was 
no reasonable expectation in 1985 that risedronate 
would be a successful compound. 
[18][19][20] Cases following KSR have considered 
whether a given molecular modification 
would have been carried out as part of routine testing. 
See, e.g., Takeda, 492 F.3d at 1360 (discussing 
the district court's finding that a modification was 
not known to be beneficial and was not considered 
“routine”). When a person of ordinary skill is faced 
with “a finite number of identified, predictable 
solutions” to a problem and pursues “the known options 
within his or her technical grasp,” the resulting 
discovery “is likely the product not of innovation 
but of ordinary skill and common sense.” KSR, 
127 S.Ct. at 1742. So too, “[g]ranting patent protection 
to advances that would occur in the ordinary

566 F.3d 989, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1947 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989) 

course without real innovation retards progress.” Id. 
at 1741. In other cases, though, researchers can 
only “vary all parameters or try each of numerous 
possible choices until *997 one possibly arrive[s] at 
a successful result, where the prior art [gives] either 
no indication of which parameters [are] critical or 
no direction as to which of many possible choices is 
likely to be successful.” In re O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 
894, 903 (Fed.Cir.1988). In such cases, “courts 
should not succumb to hindsight claims of obviousness.” 
In re Kubin, 561 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2009). 
Similarly, patents are not barred just because it was 
obvious “to explore a new technology or general 
approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, 
where the prior art gave only general 
guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention 
or how to achieve it.” In re O'Farrell, 853 
F.2d at 903. 

In this case, there is no credible evidence that 
the structural modification was routine. The district 
court found that the appellee's expert was evasive 
on this topic, stating that the witness “did not directly 
respond to most questions posed to him about 
whether it would be common for a chemist who develops 
a pyridine compound to conceive of and 
make [2-pyr EHDP, 3-pyr EHDP, and 4-pyr EHDP] 
isomers.” Procter & Gamble, 536 F.Supp.2d at 486. 
But evidence of evasion is not necessarily evidence 
that the testimony would otherwise have been favorable. 
The only direct evidence that the structural 
modification was routine was presented by an expert 
witness that the district court judge discredited.

FN1 

FN1. Appellant's expert testified that “if 

someone was aware that [2-pyr EHDP] 

was safe and effective, they would imme


diately in terms of the drug discovery ef


fort, make the [3-pyr EHDP].” However, 

the district court concluded that this wit


ness “had no specialized experience in the 

area of bisphosphonates” aside from his 

preparation to testify in the litigation. 

Procter & Gamble, 536 F.Supp.2d at 480. 

Additionally, the expert prepared his opinion 
by reviewing drug profiles in the current 
version of the Physician's Desk Reference 
instead of drug profiles from the relevant 
time, causing his opinions to be 
“marred by hindsight.” Id. at 495. 

Accordingly, we conclude that the district court 
did not clearly err in finding that Teva had not established 
a prima facie case of obviousness as to 
the challenged claims of the '122 patent. 

V. Unexpected Results 
The district court found that, even if Teva 
could establish a prima facie case of obviousness, P 
& G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected 
results to rebut such a showing. Such evidence 
included “test data showing that the claimed composition[ 
] possess[es] unexpectedly improved 
properties or properties that the prior art does not 
have.” In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692-93 
(Fed.Cir.1990). Because Teva did not establish a 
prima facie case of obviousness, P & G need not 
rely on this evidence to defend the '122 patent. 

Nonetheless, we note that P & G's witnesses 
consistently testified that the properties of risedronate 
were not expected. For example, Dr. Benedict 
testified that he and other researchers did not predict 
the potency of risedronate. Ms. McOsker testified 
that she was “very surprised” by the low dose 
at which risedronate was effective. Dr. Miller stated 
that the superior properties of risedronate were unexpected 
and could not have been predicted. In a 
test to determine the lowest dose at which these 
compounds caused toxic reactions, risedronate outperformed 
2-pyr EHDP by a substantial margin. 
Risedronate showed no observable toxic effect at a 
dose of 0.75 mg P/kg/day, while 2-pyr EHDP's “no 
observable effect level” was only 0.25 mg P/ 
kg/day. In another test involving live animals, 2-pyr 
EHDP was lethal at a dose of 1.0 mg P/kg/day 
while risedronate was *998 not. Ultimately, the district 
court weighed the evidence and evaluated the 
credibility of the witnesses in concluding that P & 
G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected

566 F.3d 989, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1947 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989) 

results to rebut any finding of obviousness. 

VI. Secondary Considerations of Non-
Obviousness 
[21][22][23] Secondary considerations of non-
obviousness include the commercial success of the 
invention at issue and its satisfaction of a long-felt 
need. B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys. 
Corp., 72 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996). The district 
court found that secondary considerations supported 
a finding of non-obviousness. When present, 
such factors “may often be the most probative and 
cogent evidence [of non-obviousness] in the record.” 
Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 
1530, 1538 (Fed.Cir.1983). 

The district court found that risedronate, marketed 
as Actonel, has been an undisputed commercial 
success and satisfied a long-felt unmet need.

FN2 

This conclusion was based on the testimony of 
Dr. Daniel C. Smith, who stated that risedronate experienced 
favorable growth and had amassed $2.7 
billion in aggregate domestic sales. The district 
court based its finding of a long-felt unmet need on 
the fact that, in the mid-1980s, osteoporosis was recognized 
as a serious disease and existing treatments 
were inadequate. However, because the competing 
drug alendronate was available before risedronate, 
Teva contends that risedronate could not 
have satisfied any unmet need. Teva argues that the 
long-felt need must be unmet at the time the invention 
becomes available on the market, when it can 
actually satisfy that need. To support this argument, 
Teva cites Monarch Knitting Mach. Corp. v. Sulzer 
Morat GmbH, 139 F.3d 877 (Fed.Cir.1998). In fact, 
Monarch rejects a similar argument partly because 
the competing inventions were not actually produced 
until after the claimed invention's filing date. 
Id. at 884. Here, alendronate was not produced until 
ten years after the filing of the '122 patent. Under 
Monarch, we look to the filing date of the challenged 
invention to assess the presence of a long-
felt and unmet need. Accordingly, it was not clear 
error for the district court to conclude that risedronate 
met such a need and that secondary considera


tions supported a finding of non-obviousness. 

FN2. The court rightly gave little weight to 
risedronate's commercial success because 
the prior art '406 patent was also assigned 
to P & G. As of December 6, 1985, the filing 
date of the '122 patent, 2-pyr EHDP 
could be found only in a pending application 
for the '406 patent, which was not 
available to the public. See Merck & Co., 
Inc. v. Teva Pharma. USA, Inc., 395 F.3d 
1364, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2005) (holding that 
commercial success is not significantly 
probative of non-obviousness where others 
are barred from acting on the prior art). 

VII. Whether the '406 Patent is Prior Art 
[24] As an alternative to its position that risedronate 
was not obvious, P & G argues that the '406 
patent should not be considered prior art with respect 
to the '122 patent because risedronate was 
first synthesized by P & G before the '406 patent 
was filed. At trial, Dr. Benedict, one of the inventors 
named in the '122 patent, testified that he synthesized 
risedronate in May 1985. P & G submitted 
a portion of Dr. Benedict's laboratory notebook 
which contains a May 3, 1985 entry detailing the 
structure of risedronate and the procedure for its 
synthesis, but this entry was unwitnessed and was 
not corroborated by any other evidence. 
*999 [25] “It is well established that when a 
party seeks to prove conception via the oral testimony 
of a putative inventor, the party must proffer 
evidence corroborating that testimony.” Shu-Hui 
Chen v. Bouchard, 347 F.3d 1299, 1309 
(Fed.Cir.2003). The inventor “must provide independent 
corroborating evidence in addition to his 
own statements and documents.” Hahn v. Wong, 
892 F.2d 1028, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1989). Because P & 
G did not provide adequate corroborating evidence 
of an earlier invention date for risedronate, the district 
court correctly concluded that the '406 patent 
qualifies as prior art for purposes of this inquiry. 

VIII. Obviousness-Type Double Patenting

566 F.3d 989, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1947 

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989) 

[26][27][28] In addition to its obviousness defense, 
Teva also asserted that the '122 patent was 
invalid for double patenting. The double patenting 
doctrine is designed to prevent a patent owner from 
extending his exclusive rights to an invention 
through claims in a later-filed patent that are not 
patentably distinct from claims in the earlier filed 
patent. Geneva Pharm., Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline 
PLC, 349 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2003) In general, 
the obviousness analysis applies to double patenting, 
except for three distinctions. First, statutory 
obviousness compares claimed subject matter to the 
prior art, while non-statutory double patenting compares 
claims in an earlier patent to claims in a later 
patent or application. Id. at 1377 n. 1. Second, 
double patenting does not require inquiry into a 
motivation to modify the prior art. Id. Finally, 
double patenting does not require inquiry into objective 
criteria suggesting non-obviousness. Id. 

Having concluded that risedronate was not obvious 
under 35 U.S.C. § 103, we similarly conclude 
that the '122 patent is not invalid for obviousness-
type double patenting. Additionally, we agree with 
the district court that the claims of the '122 patent 
are distinct from the claims of the '406 patent. 
Comparing the claims of the '122 patent to those of 
the '406 patent, we note that, while claims 4 and 16 
of the '122 patent explicitly claim the risedronate 
compound, the '406 patent claims an intermittent 
dosing regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis 
and claims no new compounds. Accordingly, Teva 
failed to present clear and convincing evidence of 
overlap between the claims of the two patents to invalidate 
the '122 patent based on obviousness-type 
double patenting.

The United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia held that later developments in the art 
may inform the “patentably distinct” determination 

for double patenting. Double patenting doctrines 
and case law permit this court to agree in part, but 
only to the extent that the subsequent developments 
predate the secondary application that triggers a 
double patenting rejection. Because genuine issues 
of fact cloud the date of availability of materially 
distinct processes, as well as the viability of those 
processes, this court vacates and remands. 

I. 
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Takeda) 
filed a patent application disclosing certain cephem 
compounds and the process for making those compounds 
in Japan on December 19, 1974. Takeda 
filed later applications in the United Kingdom on 
June 9, 1975, and in the United States on December 
19, 1975. Takeda developed these new cephem 
compounds through an acylation process, introducing 
a new acyl group (RC=O) to an amino group 
(-NR).

3

Takeda obtained a number of patents claiming 
these cephem compounds through a series of continuations, 
continuations-in-part, and divisional applications, 
including *1374 the compound patents 
that issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,098,888 (the '888 
product patent) (application filed Dec. 19, 1975) 
and its divisional, U.S. Patent No. 4,298,606 (the 
'606 product patent) (application filed Aug. 28, 
1979). This court refers to the December 19, 1975 
application as the “primary application.” Takeda 
filed these applications before June 8, 1995, making 
them subject to the seventeen year patent term regime. 
See 35 U.S.C. § 154(c). In other words, the 
patent terms on these inventions began on their 
grant date, not on their filing date. 

On January 8, 1990, Takeda filed its secondary 
application covering the process for making the 
cephem compounds claimed in the '888 and '606 
product patents-sixteen years after the 1974 priority 
date, and more than fourteen years after the filing 
of the '888 product patent application. The process 
patent issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,583,216 (the '216 
process patent) on December 10, 1996, claiming the 
sole process known and disclosed in the Japanese

(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372) 

priority patent application. The '216 process patent 
led to the double patenting issue in this appeal. 

In 1998, the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office (PTO) received two anonymous requests 
for reexamination of the '216 process patent. 
These requests asserted that the '216 process patent 
was invalid for “obviousness-type” double patenting 
in view of Takeda's prior patents, as well as 
other prior art. During reexamination, Takeda relied 
upon the declaration of Dr. Wuest disclosing an alternative 
process (displacement process) for making 
the cephem compounds claimed in the '216 patent. 
Not persuaded by the Wuest declaration, the examiner 
rejected the '216 process patent claims as patentably 
indistinct over the '606 product patent 
claims. Takeda appealed the rejection to the Board 
of Patent Appeals and Interferences (the Board). 
The Board dismissed Dr. Wuest's declaration as 
“speculative” and upheld the examiner's double patenting 
rejection. 

Takeda challenged the Board's decision in the 
District Court for the District of Columbia under 35 

U.S.C. § 145. Before the district court, Takeda 
presented new evidence in the form of a declaration 
of Dr. Duggan. In her declaration, Dr. Duggan explained 
that the process disclosed in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 6,552,186 (the Gerlach patent, published on 
Sept. 12, 2002, issued Apr. 22, 2003) and 7,071,329 
(the Monguzzi patent, published June 2, 2005, issued 
July 4, 2006) provides a viable alternative, 
non-infringing process for making the certain cephem 
compounds claimed in the '606 product patent. 
For purposes of cross-motions for summary 
judgment, the parties stipulated that “Method B” of 
the Duggan declaration described a materially distinct 
alternative process. Therefore, before the district 
court, the parties disputed whether the alternative 
process-Method B, developed after the date of 
invention-could defeat the double patenting rejection. 


The district court concluded that “subsequent 
developments in the art [are relevant to] determin


ing whether alternative processes exist” when 
weighing patentable distinctions for double patenting. 
Takeda Pharm. Co. v. Dudas, 511 F.Supp.2d 
81, 91 (D.D.C.2007). Relying on Dr. Duggan's disclosure 
of Method B (published in the Gerlach and 
Monguzi patents in 2002 and 2005, respectively) 
the district court found that the product and process 
are “patentably distinct” and overturned the double 
patenting rejection. Id. at 92. The district court 
therefore granted Takeda's motion for summary 
judgment that it was entitled to a reexamination 
certificate, confirming its right to the '216 patent. 
At the same time, the court denied the PTO's motion 
for summary judgment. The PTO *1375 timely 
filed a notice of appeal with this court.

grant of “a patent” for any new and useful invention. 
35 U.S.C. § 101; Perricone, 432 F.3d at 
1372-73. Non-statutory, or “obviousness-type,” 
double patenting is a judicially created doctrine designed 
to foreclose “claims in separate applications 
or patents that do not recite the ‘same’ invention, 
but nonetheless claim inventions so alike that granting 
both exclusive rights would effectively extend 
the life of patent protection.” Perricone, 432 F.3d 
at 1373. 

[7] In other words, the double patenting doctrine 
is designed to prevent “unjustified timewise 
extension of the right to exclude.” In re Van 
Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 943-44 (CCPA 1982). For 
instance, the doctrine bars an applicant from obtaining 
separate patents with separate terms for both a 
product and process for making that product, unless 
the product and process are “patentably distinct.” 
See In re Taylor, 53 C.C.P.A. 1187, 360 F.2d 232, 
234 (1966); In re Cady, 22 C.C.P.A. 1190, 77 F.2d 
106, 109 (1935) (instructing that “double patenting 
is not sustainable when the product can be fabricated 
by processes other than that secured by the issued 
process patent”) (quotation marks omitted). 
The PTO's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure 
(MPEP) explains that a product and its process are 
patentably distinct if “the product as claimed can be 
made by another materially different process.” 
MPEP § 806.05. 
The parties agree that product and process 
claims are patentably distinct if multiple processes 
for creating a product exist at the time of the invention. 
See, e.g., In re Cady, 77 F.2d at 109 (finding 
that the process of manufacturing roofing material 
was patentably distinct from roofing composition 
when “appellant's product as defined in the appealed 
claims may be produced by processes other 
than the processes patented”). 

The novel legal question in this case asks if 
later-developed alternative processes are relevant in 
the product-process “patentably distinct” inquiry. 
The PTO contends that the date of invention, in this 
case December 19, 1974, governs the relevance of 

products and processes in the double patenting context. 
Thus, the PTO submits that the date of invention 
governs the timing of double patenting analyses 
*1376 because other issues relating to patentability 
are judged from the date of invention. For 
example, the patentability requirements set forth in 
§§ 112, 102, and 103 are judged as of the date of 
invention or filing. See 35 U.S.C. §§ 112, 102, 103. 
The PTO does not cite statutory or case support for 
the “date of invention” approach other than analogizing 
to these other patentability requirements. In 
the alternative, the PTO posits that alternative processes 
must at least appear before issuance of the 
primary patent application. 

Takeda, on the other hand, argues that the 
PTO's approach is too limited. In its view, processes 
developed after the date of invention deserve 
a role in the double patenting calculus. Acknowledging 
that this court has not directly addressed 
this legal question before, Takeda relies on a district 
court case for the proposition that a court can 
look to processes developed after the date of invention 
for product-process double patenting situations. 
See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. U.S. Steel 
Corp., 604 F.Supp. 555 (D.Del.1985) (Phillips ). 

In Phillips, the district court considered a process 
developed in 1954, one year after the date of 
invention. Id. at 567. In a footnote, the district court 
noted that courts have considered developments in 
the art arising after the date of invention when 
resolving double patenting issues. In those cases, 
however, the parties did not object to the court's 
consideration of post-date inventive developments. 
Id. at 568. The district court further noted the 
Board's discussion in Ex Parte Hogan, No. 436-63, 
(Pat. & Tr. Office Bd.App. Mar. 30, 1981), a nonprecedential 
case from the Board of Patent Appeals. 
In Ex Parte Hogan, the Board considered a later-
disclosed process in a double patenting challenge. 
See slip op. at 5. Agreeing that later-developed processes 
are relevant to the “patentably distinct” inquiry, 
the Phillips Court “decline[d] to conduct the 
double patenting analysis with blinders so as to

(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372) 

avoid recognition or discourage disclosure of advances 
in process technology as a means of making 
a product patent.” Phillips, 604 F.Supp. at 568. 
This court affirmed Phillips on appeal. U.S. Steel 
Corp. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 865 F.2d 1247 
(Fed.Cir.1989) (Phillips II ). 

In this case, Takeda argues that this court's affirmance 
of Phillips rejected the PTO's exact “date 
of invention” position. But on closer look, the only 
mention of double patenting in Phillips II is in the 
penultimate paragraph: 

III. Remaining Arguments 
We have carefully considered defendants' arguments 
regarding: (1) double patenting .... We find 
none persuasive of error in the district court's disposition 
of any of those issues and none of sufficient 
import to require discussion here of that disposition. 
IV. Conclusion 
The judgment of the district court is affirmed in 
all respects. 
Id. at 1253 (emphasis added). While Phillips II 
affirmed Phillips “in all respects,” this court did 
not address the double patenting argument. Thus, 
Phillips II did not present a rule or reasoning that 
decides the case before this court in this appeal. 
See Nat'l Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. Am. 
Cinema Editors, Inc., 937 F.2d 1572, 1581 
(Fed.Cir.1991) (“When an issue ... is ignored in a 
decision, such decision is not precedent to be followed 
in a subsequent case in which the issue 
arises.”). 

The PTO argues that here, the product and process 
were not “patentably distinct” as of the date of 
invention, so the double patenting doctrine should 
bar consideration of later-filed process claims. 
However, adopting the PTO's approach of the “date 
of invention” is only appealing at *1377 first 
glance. It appears to provide a bright-line test that 
conforms to the perspective used in other patentability 
determinations. But as Takeda points out in its 
brief, the “date of invention” raises other substant


ive questions such as: is the filing date the presumptive 
“date of invention”? If so, what is the date 
of invention, the domestic or foreign filing date? If 
foreign, must a claim have been “perfected” under 
§ 119(e) with the filing of a certified copy of the 
original foreign application and an English language 
translation? What if the priority application 
contains support for some but not all of the patent 
claims? Would some of the claims be judged as of 
different cutoff dates? What if the inventor swears 
behind a reference? 

In contrast, the district court's “doing away 
with blinders” approach allows an applicant to 
come forward with any evidence that its product 
and process are patentably distinct, even if the alternative 
process is developed decades after the filing 
dates of the product and process applications. 
The approach provides the patentee with the best of 
both worlds: the applicant can use the filing date as 
a shield, enjoying the earlier priority date in order 
to avoid prior art, and rely on later-developed alternative 
processes as a sword to defeat double patenting 
challenges. Here, the primary application, 
directed to certain cephem compounds, was filed in 
the United States on December 19, 1975. The secondary 
application, directed to the process for making 
these cephem compounds, was filed in 1990. 
Yet the district court relied on patent applications 
published several decades later to show a patentable 
distinction between the product and process. 

[8][9][10] This court is not persuaded by either 
approach. Neither approach addresses the policies 
underlying the double patenting doctrine. The secondary 
application (in this case, the process application 
of January 8, 1990) actually triggers the potential 
of an “unjustified extension of patent term.” 
When filing the secondary application, the applicant 
essentially avers that the product and process 
are “patentably distinct.” Thus, the relevant time 
frame for determining whether a product and process 
are “patentably distinct” should be at the filing 
date of the secondary application. In this case, 
Takeda filed the '216 process patent application on

(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372) 

January 8, 1990. This approach allows an applicant 
to rely on some later-developed methods to show 
that the product and process are “patentably distinct,” 
even though the alternative processes for 
making that product may not have been known at 
the filing date of the primary application. This rule 
gives the applicant the benefit of future developments 
in the art. At the same time, however, it prevents 
the inequitable situation that arises when an 
applicant attempts to rely on developments occurring 
decades after the filing date of the secondary 

FN1

application.

FN1. The dissent's hypothetical is a 
stretch. It assumes nineteen years of copendency. 
Today, patent terms are 
triggered by the filing date, not the grant 
date. In other words, both the product and 
process patents will expire around the 
same time (although there may be slight 
variance due to patent term adjustment). 
As such, an applicant is less likely to maintain 
co-pendency for nineteen years. 
Moreover, this court's prosecution laches 
doctrine “may render a patent unenforceable 
when it has issued only after an unreasonable 
and unexplained delay in prosecution.” 
Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Lemelson 
Med., Educ. & Research Found., 422 F.3d 
1378, 1384-85 (Fed.Cir.2005). 

This approach should encourage the swift development 
of materially distinct, alternative processes. 
It is also consistent with the district court's 
opinion in Phillips, 604 F.Supp. at 567 (considering 
an alternative process developed one year after the 
filing date of the primary application, and *1378 
prior to the filing of the secondary application). 

[11] Therefore, in this case, the applicant can 
rely on subsequent developments in the art up to 
January 8, 1990, the filing date of the secondary application, 
in order to show a patentable distinction 
between the cephem compounds claimed in the '606 
product patent and the process for making those 
compounds claimed in the '216 process patent. In 
that regard, Takeda indicates that it disclosed an 
unclaimed process (which it terms the 
“Displacement Process” or the “Unelected Method”) 
in the '888 product patent application. The 
PTO, however, has continually “dispute[d] the viability 
of the ... [D]isplacement [P]rocess.” Additionally, 
Takeda asserts that Method B, disclosed in 
the Gerlach and Monguzzi patents and described in 
the Duggan Declaration, was disclosed as early as 
1979. On this point, the PTO states that it “di[d] not 
dispute the technical merits of Dr. Duggan's declaration” 
only for purposes of cross-motions for summary 
judgment. Further, the PTO stated in its motion 
for summary judgment that “[t]he only 
‘alternative’ processes that Takeda (through Dr. 
Duggan's declaration) has identified to this Court 
are the processes described in ... the ‘Gerlach’ patent[ 
] and in ... the ‘Monguzzi’ patent[ ].” Today, 
this court holds that the district court may not rely 
on the Gerlach and Monguzzi patents. But questions 
of material fact remain as to (1) the viability 
of the Displacement Process, and (2) the disclosure 
date of Method B. On remand, the district court 
should determine whether these processes were disclosed 
before January 8, 1990, the date of filing of 
the '216 process patent. 

III. 
Because genuine issues of material fact exist 
with respect to whether the cephem compound and 
later-developed processes are “patentably distinct,” 
this court vacates and remands for further factual 
development.

fully part company with the majority in its conclusion 
that Takeda should be able to rely on developments 
in the art up to January 8, 1990, the date of 
the filing of the '216 process patent application. In 
my view, in arguing against the claim of obvious-
ness-type double patenting, Takeda should not be 
able to rely on disclosures after the December 19, 

FN1

1974 invention date. I believe that tying the inquiry 
to the invention date is most commensurate 
with patent law as a whole and the policy goals relating 
to obviousness-type double patenting. 

FN1. The PTO and Takeda used this date 
as the “presumed date of invention” in 
briefing and argument, so I will use it here 
as well. 

First, it seems to me that the date of invention 
is most appropriate because it comports with current 
patentability doctrines, and, as I explain later, I 
view product-process obviousness-type double patenting 
as a patentability doctrine. See, e.g., 35 

U.S.C. § 102(a) (“A person shall be entitled to a 
patent unless ... the invention was known or used 
by others in this *1379 country, or patented or described 
in a printed publication in this or a foreign 
country, before the invention thereof by the applicant 
for patent. ” (emphasis added)); 35 U.S.C. § 
102(e) (“A person shall be entitled to a patent unless 
... the invention was described in (1) an application 
for patent, published under section 122(b), by 
another filed in the United States before the invention 
by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent granted 
on an application for patent by another filed in 
the United States before the invention by the applicant 
for patent ....” (emphases added)); Apotex Corp. 
v. Merck & Co., 507 F.3d 1357, 1359 
(Fed.Cir.2007) (“ 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) provides that 
an applicant is not entitled to a patent if ‘ before 
such person's invention thereof, the invention was 
made in this country by another, who had not abandoned, 
suppressed, or concealed it.’ ” (quoting 35 
U.S.C. § 102(g)) (emphasis added)); In re Translogic 
Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1259 (Fed.Cir.2007) 
(“An invention is unpatentable as obvious if the dif


ferences between the patented subject matter and 
the prior art would have been obvious at the time of 
invention to a person of ordinary skill in the art.” 
(emphasis added)); cf. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 
F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc) (“We 
have made clear ... that the ordinary and customary 
meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the 
term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the 
art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as 
of the effective filing date of the patent application.” 
(emphasis added)); Plant Genetic Sys., N.V. 

v. DeKalb Genetics Corp., 315 F.3d 1335, 1339 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (“Enablement is determined as of 
the effective filing date of the patent. ” (emphasis 
added)). 
Second, we have previously emphasized the invention 
date with respect to obviousness-type 
double patenting: 

The public should ... be able to act on the assumption 
that upon the expiration of the patent it 
will be free to use not only the invention claimed 
in the patent but also modifications or variants 
which would have been obvious to those of ordinary 
skill in the art at the time the invention 
was made, taking into account the skill of the art 
and prior art other than the invention claimed in 
the issued patent. 

In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 893 (Fed.Cir.1985) 

(emphases from original omitted, emphasis added). 
Pertinent to this case, I view product-process obviousness-
type double patenting as a patentability 
doctrine. At the date of invention, if only one process 
exists to make the product, the two are 
“substantially co-extensive.” See PTO's Br. 17. To 
allow two patents to issue at that time would essentially 
run afoul of 35 U.S.C. § 101, as the applicant 
would be receiving two patents on one invention.

(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372) 

cess double patenting doctrine back to its § 
101 origins serves to bolster the connection 
between the doctrine and other questions 
of patentability. 

In a difficult case, the majority settles upon 
what I would characterize as a not-unreasonable attempt 
at compromise. Rejecting the approaches of 
both Takeda and the government, it holds that “the 
relevant time frame for determining whether a 
product and process are ‘patentably distinct’ should 
be at the filing date of the ['216 process patent application].” 
It thus concludes, in the setting of a 
pre-1995 filing, that art developed after a product/ 
process invention date, but before a subsequent process 
patent application filing*1380 date, can render 
a previously unpatentable process patentable. 
Through its approach, the majority concludes it is 
preventing the patentee from having the best of 
both worlds, whereby “the applicant can use the filing 
date as a shield, enjoying the earlier priority 
date in order to avoid prior art, and rely on later-
developed alternative processes as a sword to defeat 
double patenting.” Maj. op. at 1376-77. However, 
while the majority's approach is more restrictive 
than that urged by Takeda, it still allows Takeda to 
exclude sixteen years of prior art for invalidity purposes 
(such as 35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 103), while simultaneously 
taking advantage of that art to overcome 
a double-patenting rejection. This is what troubles 
me about the majority's understandable desire to 
find a middle ground in this case. It allows Takeda 
to have it both ways. In addition, as far as I can tell, 
there is no other doctrine or rule that allows unpatentable 
material to spring back into patentability 
based on later developments in the field. 

As correctly stated by the majority, “ ‘[t]he 
fundamental reason for the rule [of obviousness-
type double patenting] is to prevent unjustified 
timewise extension of the right to exclude granted 
by a patent no matter how the extension is brought 
about.’ ” Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 
F.3d 955, 967-68 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting In re Van 
Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 943-44 (CCPA 1982)) 

(alterations in original). The majority's approach, it 
seems to me, allows for such an extension. The 
product and the unpatentable process should both 
have entered into the public domain in 1998, when 
the '606 patent expired. At that point, members of 
the public should have been able to make the cephem 
compounds without paying royalties to Takeda 
or to another company. However, Takeda's rights in 
the '216 process patent will not expire until 
2013-almost forty years after its process was first 
disclosed. In my view, this is an “unjustified time-
wise extension” of the right to exclude. Although 
the cephem compounds are in the public domain, 
no currently unpatented method exists for making 
them. 

I am also concerned that the majority's approach 
could, in certain cases, result in the upsetting 
of reasonable expectations as to what is in the 
public domain. For example, let us assume we are 
in the seventeen-year regime, as we are in this case. 
Takeda is granted a product patent in year one. At 
that time, only one process exists (Process A). That 
process is disclosed, but not claimed, in the patent. 
In year eighteen, the product patent expires, putting 
Process A fully into the public domain. In addition, 
during the seventeen-year patent term, no other process 
has been developed, and thus Process A remains 
unpatentable separately because it is coextensive 
with the product patent. See In re Taylor, 53 

C.C.P.A. 1187, 360 F.2d 232, 234 (1966); In re 
Cady, 22 C.C.P.A. 1190, 77 F.2d 106, 109 (1935) 
(“[D]ouble patenting is not sustainable when the 
product can be fabricated by processes other than 
that secured by the issued process patent.”). Then, 
in year nineteen, a second process, called Process 
B, is invented for making the patented product. The 
initial inventor then files a patent application on 
Process A (assume proper co-pendency with the 
product patent), triggering double-patenting concerns. 
According to the majority's approach, this 
second process would cause Process A to become 
patentable, despite the fact that Process A and the 
resulting product were in the public domain for one 
year. It seems to me such a result runs counter to

(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372) 

public expectation and patent law's public notice 
function. 

Finally, the majority sets forth various questions 
which it says counsel toward its approach: 

[A]dopting the PTO's approach of the “date of invention” 
is only appealing at *1381 first glance. 
It appears to provide a bright-line test that conforms 
to the perspective used in other patentability 
determinations. But as Takeda points out in its 
brief, the “date of invention” raises other substantive 
questions such as: is the filing date the 
presumptive “date of invention”? If so, what is 
the date of invention, the domestic or foreign filing 
date? If foreign, must a claim have been 
“perfected” under § 119(e) with the filing of a 
certified copy of the original foreign application 
and an English language translation? What if the 
priority application contains support for some but 
not all of the patent claims? Would some of the 
claims be judged as of different cutoff dates? 
What if the inventor swears behind a reference? 

Maj. op. at 1376-77. 

I do not share the majority's concern. I think 
we must keep in mind these kinds of questions are 
faced regularly and have been manageable. For example, 
interference proceedings provide a parallel 
to double-patenting: a court (or the Board of Patent 
Appeals and Interferences) must look to the date of 
invention while evaluating two competing applications. 
That additional questions may have to be addressed 
if the approach urged by the government is 
adopted does not mean that we should ignore that 
approach if we feel it is correct. 

It may be that the new patent term will cure 
many of the concerns enumerated in this opinion. 
However, that does not mean that we should ignore 
those concerns. Obviousness-type double patenting 
is a judicially created doctrine, and using the date 
of invention best comports with our previously 
stated policy goals underlying the doctrine. For the 
foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the 

majority's decision allowing Takeda to use developments 
in the art that post-date the date of invention 
in arguing against the obviousness-type double patenting 
rejection.

Background: Holder of patents relating to automated 
toll collection systems brought infringement 
action against toll collection service provider. The 
United States District Court for the Northern District 
of Texas, James Edgar Kinkeade, J., 2008 WL 
2152027, entered summary judgment in provider's 
favor, and holder appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) doctrine of patent exhaustion barred holder's 
patent infringement claims against provider; 
(2) parol evidence of parties' intent not to provide 
downstream rights to customers was irrelevant; and 
(3) holder's rights to patent that had not yet issued, 
and was thus not identified in settlement agreement, 
were exhausted.

TransCore, LP and TC License, Ltd. 
(collectively “TransCore”) appeal from a final 
judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas that was entered upon the district 
court's grant *1273 of summary judgment. See 
Transcore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants 
Corp., No. 3:05-CV-2316-K, 2008 WL 
2152027 (N.D.Tex. May 22, 2008). Specifically, 
the District Court found that TransCore's patent infringement 
claims against Electronic Transaction 
Consultants Corp. (“ETC”) were barred by patent 
exhaustion, implied license and legal estoppel, in 
view of a settlement agreement between TransCore 
and the supplier of the products ETC installed, 
Mark IV. Because we agree with the district court 
and find that Mark IV's sales were authorized and 
exhausted TransCore's patent rights, thus barring 
TransCore's claims against ETC, we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

TransCore is engaged in the manufacture, sale 
and installation of automated toll collection systems-
the tags and readers that communicate as a 
vehicle passes through an automated toll plaza 
(e.g., E-ZPass). TransCore is the assignee of several 
patents to related technologies. 

In 2000, TransCore sued a competitor, Mark IV 
Industries, for infringement of several TransCore 
patents. That action was resolved by a settlement 
agreement, in which Mark IV agreed to pay $4.5M 
in exchange for an unconditional covenant not to 
sue and a release of all existing claims. The covenant 
and release, which are central to the dispute 
here, read: 

3. In exchange for the payment set forth in paragraph 
1, TCI hereby agrees and covenants not to 
bring any demand, claim, lawsuit, or action 
against Mark IV for future infringement of any of 
United States Patent Nos. 5,805,082; 5,289,183; 
5,406,275; 5,144,553; 5,086,389; 5,751,973; 
5,347,274; 5,351,187; 5,253,162; and 4,303,904, 
or any foreign counterparts of the aforesaid 
United States Patents, for the entire remainder of 
the terms of the respective United States Patents 
and their foreign counterparts. This Covenant Not 
To Sue shall not apply to any other patents issued 
as of the effective date of this Agreement or to be 
issued in the future. 

*** 

8. TCI, TII and GRAVELLE, for themselves and 
their respective predecessors, successors, heirs 
and assigns, fully and forever release, discharge 
and dismiss all claims, demands, actions, causes 
of action, liens and rights, in law or in equity 
(known, unknown, contingent, accrued, inchoate 
or otherwise), existing as of June 26, 2001, that 
they have against MARK IV, and its officers, directors, 
employees, representatives and attorneys 
of MARK IV, but excluding any claims for 
breach of this Agreement. No express or implied 
license or future release whatsoever is granted to 
MARK IV or to any third party by this Release. 
Several years later, ETC, a firm engaged in 
consulting and systems integration related to toll-
collection systems, won a bid with the Illinois State 
Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) to install and test 
a new open-road tolling system. As part of the contract, 
ETC agreed to set up and test toll-collection 
systems purchased by the ISTHA from Mark IV. 

TransCore sued ETC for infringement of three 
patents that had previously been in suit against 
Mark IV (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,805,082; 5,289,183; 
and 5,406,275 (the '082, '183, and '275 patents)) as 
well as U.S. Patent No. 6,653,946 (the '946 patent), 
a related patent that was pending *1274 before the 
Patent and Trademark Office but had not yet issued 
at the time of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement. 
During a hearing, the district court questioned the

legal impact of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement on the TransCore-ETC lawsuit and 
ordered the parties to brief the issue. ETC responded 
by filing a motion for summary judgment with 
the district court, asserting that its activities were 
permitted by the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement under the related doctrines of patent exhaustion, 
implied license and legal estoppel. 

On May 22, 2008, the district court granted 
ETC's motion, dismissed TransCore's claims with 
prejudice and directed the entry of final judgment. 
TransCore timely appealed to this court. We have 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 

DISCUSSION 

Summary judgment is appropriate if “there is 
no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the 
movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of 
law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see also Anderson v. 
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 
S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We review a 
district court's grant of summary judgment without 
deference, reapplying the same standard as the district 
court. Micro Chem., Inc. v. Lextron, Inc., 318 
F.3d 1119, 1121 (Fed.Cir.2003). “In deciding 
whether summary judgment was appropriate, we 
view the evidence in a light most favorable to the 
party opposing the motion with doubts resolved in 
favor of the opponent....” Ethicon Endo-Surgery, 
Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 149 F.3d 1309, 1315 
(Fed.Cir.1998). 

I. 
[1] The district court found that Mark IV's 
sales of the toll collection systems installed by ETC 
were authorized by the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement, such that TransCore's patent rights 
FN1

were exhausted as to those systems. We agree.

FN1. Because we agree with the district 
court that TransCore's claims are barred by 
the doctrine of patent exhaustion, we need 
not address the district court's decision on 
the related doctrine of implied license by 
no non-infringing use. 

A. 
[2] Recently, in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG 
Electronics, Inc., ---U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 2109, 170 
L.Ed.2d 996 (2008), the Supreme Court reiterated 
unequivocally that “[t]he longstanding doctrine of 
patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized 
sale of a patented item terminates all patent 
rights to that item,” id. at 2115, and that 
“[e]xhaustion is triggered only by a sale authorized 
by the patent holder,” id. at 2121. The question for 
this court is whether an unconditional covenant not 
to sue authorizes sales by the covenantee for purposes 
of patent exhaustion. We hold that it does. 
TransCore asserts that sales under a covenant 
not to sue are not “authorized,” relying heavily on 

Jacobs v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 370 F.3d 1097 
(Fed.Cir.2004). In Jacobs, a panel of this court addressed 
the respective roles of a license term and a 
covenant not to sue in a settlement agreement. Explicitly 
considering downstream customer liability, 
the panel explained: 

If all that [the patent holder] intended to do 
through the settlement agreement *1275 was to 
free [the infringing manufacturer] of its liability 
for infringement, paragraph 5 of the agreement 
(the covenant not to sue) would have been fully 
sufficient to serve that purpose. Paragraph 3 [the 
license provision], however, goes much further 
by granting [the infringing manufacturer] an affirmative 
right to engage in the manufacture and 
sale of accelerometers to be used in tilt-sensitive 
control boxes. That grant comes without restriction 
of any kind. 

Id. at 1101. The court in Jacobs was differentiating 
between settlement terms for the express purpose 
of determining the contracting parties' intent 
in the context of an implied license analysis. As the 
Supreme Court explained in Quanta, however, the 
parties' intent with respect to downstream customers 
is of no moment in a patent exhaustion analysis. 
See Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at 2122 (“But the question 
whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant 
because [the downstream customer] asserts

(Cite as: 563 F.3d 1271) 

its right to practice the patents based not on implied 
license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns 
only on [licensee's] own license to sell products 
practicing the [licensor's] Patents.”). The analysis 
in Jacobs, therefore, does not apply here. 

[3] Rather, our analysis begins with the 
premise that one cannot convey what one does not 
own. This principle is particularly important in patent 
licensing, as the grant of a patent does not 
provide the patentee with an affirmative right to 
practice the patent but merely the right to exclude. 
See 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(1) (“Every patent shall contain 
... a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, 
of the right to exclude others from making, using, 
offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout 
the United States or importing the invention into 
the United States ....”); see also Leatherman Tool 
Group Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 131 F.3d 1011, 
1015 (Fed.Cir.1997) (“In fact, the federal patent 
laws do not create any affirmative right to make, 
use, or sell anything.... [T]he Supreme Court made 
clear that the patent laws provide a limited right to 
exclude others from making, using, or selling a 
claimed invention for a limited period of time, but 
afford no affirmative right to make, use, and sell a 
patented invention.” (citing Bloomer v. McQuewan, 
55 U.S. (14 How.) 539, 548, 14 L.Ed. 532 (1852) 
(“The franchise which the patent grants, consists altogether 
in the right to exclude every one from 
making, using, or vending the thing patented, 
without the permission of the patentee. This is all 
that he obtains by the patent.”))). It follows, therefore, 
that a patentee, by license or otherwise, cannot 
convey an affirmative right to practice a patented 
invention by way of making, using, selling, etc.; the 
patentee can only convey a freedom from suit. 

For this reason, the Supreme Court in De 
Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United 
States, reiterated: “As a license passes no interest in 
the monopoly, it has been described as a mere 
waiver of the right to sue by the patentee.” 273 U.S. 
236, 242, 47 S.Ct. 366, 71 L.Ed. 625 (1927) 
(treating a covenant not to enjoin infringing acts as 

a license). To like effect, this court and its predecessors 
have on numerous occasions explained that 
a non-exclusive patent license is equivalent to a 
covenant not to sue: 

As a threshold matter, a patent license agreement 
is in essence nothing more than a promise by the 
licensor not to sue the licensee. Even if couched 
in terms of “[l]icensee is given the right to make, 
use, or sell X,” the agreement cannot *1276 convey 
that absolute right because not even the patentee 
of X is given that right. His right is merely 
one to exclude others from making, using or 
selling X. Indeed, the patentee of X and his licensee, 
when making, using, or selling X, can be 
subject to suit under other patents. In any event, 
patent license agreements can be written to convey 
different scopes of promises not to sue, e.g., 
a promise not to sue under a specific patent or, 
more broadly, a promise not to sue under any patent 
the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.

means only leave to do a thing which the licensor 
would otherwise have a right to prevent. 
Such a license grants to the licensee merely a privilege 
that protects him from a claim of infringement 
by the owner of the patent monopoly.”). The real 
question, then, is not whether an agreement is 
framed in terms of a “covenant not to sue” or a 
“license.” That difference is only one of form, not 
substance-both are properly viewed as 
“authorizations.” Rather, the pertinent question 
here is not whether but what the TransCore-Mark 
IV settlement agreement authorizes. More specifically, 
does the TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement 
authorize sales? We conclude that it does. 
The language of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement is unambiguous: “[TransCore] 
agrees and covenants not to bring any demand, 
claim, lawsuit, or action against Mark IV for future 
infringement....” This term, without apparent restriction 
or limitation, thus authorizes all acts that 
would otherwise be infringements: making, using, 
offering for sale, selling, or importing. TransCore 
did not, as it could have, limit this authorization to, 
for example, “making” or “using.” And indeed, at 
oral argument, TransCore conceded that the 
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement does not 
include a restriction on sales. See Audio Recording 
of Oral Arg. at 40:54-42:25, TransCore, LP v. Elec. 
Transaction Consultants Corp., No. 2008-1430 
(Fed.Cir. Feb. 5, 2009), available at http:// oralarguments. 
cafc. uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2008-1430. mp 
3; cf. *1277Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at 2121 (applying 
patent exhaustion where “[n]othing in the License 
Agreement restricts [licensee's] right to sell its microprocessors 
and chipsets to purchasers who in


tend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It 
broadly permits Intel to ‘make, use, [or] sell’ 
products free of [licensor's] patent claims.” 
(internal quotation marks omitted)). As a result, the 
district court correctly found that Mark IV's sales to 
ISTHA were authorized and that TransCore's patent 
rights are exhausted. The inclusion of the language 
“No express or implied license or future release 
whatsoever is granted to MARK IV or to any third 
party by this Release” refers only to the effect of 
the Release provision and thus does not require a 
different result. 

B. 
As a subordinate issue to the proper interpretation 
of the covenant not to sue, TransCore argues 
that the district court abused its discretion by excluding 
parol evidence of TransCore's and Mark 
IV's intent at the time they entered into the settlement 
agreement. We disagree. 

[4][5] Evidentiary rulings, which are procedural 
in nature, are reviewed by this court according to 
the law of the regional circuit. See Sulzer Textil 

A.G. v. Picanol N.V., 358 F.3d 1356, 1363 
(Fed.Cir.2004). Applying Fifth Circuit law, “unless 
the trial court has abused its discretion and a substantial 
right of the defendant has been affected, we 
will not reverse on the basis of [an] evidentiary ruling 
in question.” United States v. Saldana, 427 F.3d 
298, 306 (5th Cir.2005). 
[6] The district court's decision to exclude 
TransCore's parol evidence has not affected any 
substantial right of TransCore. On this point 
Quanta is clear. The only issue relevant to patent 
exhaustion is whether Mark IV's sales were authorized, 
not whether TransCore and Mark IV intended, 
expressly or impliedly, for the covenant to extend 
to Mark IV's customers. See Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at 
2122. TransCore's proffered evidence of the parties' 
intent not to provide downstream rights to Mark 
IV's customers is, therefore, irrelevant and could 
not impact the outcome reached by the district court 
and affirmed here.

(Cite as: 563 F.3d 1271) 

Moreover, California law, which governs the 
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement, prohibits 
the admission of parol evidence: (i) to insert an additional 
term into a written contract, if the contract 
is a complete and exclusive statement of the terms 
of the agreement, Cal.Civ.Proc.Code § 1856(b), (d); 
and/or (ii) to influence the meaning of contract 
terms where no ambiguity exists, id. § 1856(g); see 
also Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Dray-
age & Rigging Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 

FN2

442 P.2d 641, 644-45 (Cal.1968). The district 
court correctly concluded that the settlement agreement 
is a final, complete and exclusive agreement, 
and that the settlement agreement is unambiguous. 
We, therefore, find no error in the district court's 
decision not to admit TransCore's parol evidence. 

FN2. We note that, under California law, 

the district court may receive and consider 

extrinsic evidence to determine whether 

one or more terms of a contract is reason


ably susceptible to multiple meanings, see 

Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc., 39 Cal.4th 

384, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 668, 139 P.3d 56, 60 

(2006), but once the district court determ


ines that no ambiguity exists, as it did here, 

extrinsic evidence is properly not admitted, 

see Pac. Gas, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d at 

644-45. 

*1278 C. 

TransCore further argues that several material 
facts remain in dispute: (1) which Mark IV entity 
actually sold the products to ISTHA for installation 
by ETC; (2) whether the sale from Mark IV to 
ISTHA occurred within the United States; and (3) 
assuming Mark IV U.S. (referred to by the parties, 
at times, as “IVHS”) is found to have actually sold 
the products to ISTHA, whether Mark IV U.S. was 
included within the terms of the TransCore-Mark 
IV settlement agreement, which extended coverage 
to “sister” companies of Mark IV Canada. Based on 
the record before the district court, as viewed in the 
light most favorable to TransCore (the nonmovant), 
we disagree. 

Although the parties do not agree about which 
Mark IV entity actually sold the toll collection 
products-the irrevocable offer was made by Mark 
IV US, but the purchase order was placed with (and 
the order was ultimately filled by) Mark IV 
Canada-there is no dispute that a Mark IV entity 
was responsible for the sale. 

Moreover, there is no dispute that the toll collection 
products were sold and shipped to ISTHA. 
Even if we accept TransCore's assertions that the 
products were shipped from Canada, this does not 
alter the essential fact that the transaction as a 
whole ultimately occurred “to” the United States. 
See Lightcubes, LLC v. N. Light Prods., Inc., 523 
F.3d 1353, 1369-71 (Fed.Cir.2008) (finding that a 
sale “to” the United States is sufficient to support 
infringement liability). 

Finally, as to the third “disputed” fact-whether 
Mark IV U.S. is covered by the terms of the 
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement-the 
parties do not dispute that both Mark IV U.S. and 
Mark IV Canada are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 
Mark IV Industries. Because the term “sister company” 
is commonly used and generally understood 
to refer to a subsidiary company that shares common 
ownership (i.e., a common “parent”) with another 
subsidiary company, see generally, e.g., Poly-
America, L.P. v. GSE Lining Tech., Inc., 383 F.3d 
1303 (Fed.Cir.2004) (referring to two corporations 
that share a common parent as “sister corporations”); 
Humana Inc. v. Comm'r, 881 F.2d 247 (6th 
Cir.1989) (referring to all subsidiaries of Humana, 
Inc. as “brother-sister” corporations), we find it to 
be beyond dispute that Mark IV U.S. is a “sister” 
company of Mark IV Canada and thus has the same 
express authority under the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement as any other “sister” company. 

II. 
[7] The district court further found that 
TransCore's rights to the ' 946 patent-which had not 
yet issued and was thus not identified in the 
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement-were exhausted 
by Mark IV's authorized sales under an im©

(Cite as: 563 F.3d 1271) 

plied license to practice that patent by virtue of legal 
estoppel. Again, we agree with the district court. 

As explained by our predecessor court in AMP 
Inc. v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448 
(1968): 

[W]hen a person sells a patent which employs an 
invention which infringes a prior patent, the person 
selling is estopped from bringing an action 
against his grantee for that infringement, even 
though the earlier patent is acquired after the sale 
of the later patent. The same principle applies to 
the grant of a patent right by license as well as 
assignment. 

*1279 Id. at 451 (citation omitted). Although 
TransCore argues that this form of legal estoppel 
only applies to “prior” or “earlier” patents, we see 
no reason for so fine a distinction-the timing of patent 
issuance is no more relevant to this inquiry than 
the timing of acquisition. Indeed, the court in AMP 
explained the policy rationale underlying the legal 
estoppel doctrine in the following manner: 

The essence of legal estoppel that can be found in 
the estoppel of the implied license doctrine involves 
the fact that the licensor (or assignor) has 
licensed (or assigned) a definable property right 
for valuable consideration, and then has attempted 
to derogate or detract from that right. The 
grantor is estopped from taking back in any extent 
that for which he has already received consideration. 


Id. at 452. The basic principle is, therefore, 
quite simple: “Legal estoppel refers to a narrow[ ] 
category of conduct encompassing scenarios where 
a patentee has licensed or assigned a right, received 
consideration, and then sought to derogate from the 
right granted.” Wang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi 
Elecs. Am., Inc., 103 F.3d 1571, 1581 
(Fed.Cir.1997). 

On summary judgment, ETC asserted, and 

FN3

TransCore did not dispute,that TransCore's 
later-issued '946 patent was broader than, and ne


cessary to practice, at least the '082 patent that was 
included in the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement. Indeed, during discovery TransCore adopted 
its ' 082 patent infringement contentions as 

FN4

its contentions related to the ' 946 patent. Absent 
argument to the contrary, the district court 
properly concluded that in order for Mark IV to obtain 
the benefit of its bargain with TransCore, it 
must be permitted to practice the '946 patent to the 
same extent it may practice the '183, '275 and '082 
patents. TransCore is, therefore, legally estopped 
from asserting the '946 patent against Mark IV in 
derogation of the authorizations granted to Mark IV 
under the '183, '275 and '082 patents. And Mark IV 
is, in turn, an implied licensee of the ' 946 patent. 
The language of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement 
agreement, which states that “[t]his Covenant Not 
To Sue shall not apply to any other patents ... to be 
issued in the future,” is not to the contrary. This 
language may protect TransCore against broad 
claims that future patents generally are impliedly licensed, 
but it does not permit TransCore to derogate 
from the rights it has expressly granted and thus 
does not preclude a finding of estoppel. 

FN3. On appeal, TransCore claims that it 
is possible to practice the '183, '275 and ' 
082 patents without infringing the '946 patent. 
TransCore did not, however, raise this 
argument to the district court. We, therefore, 
deem it waived. See Sage Prods., Inc. 

v. Devon Indus., Inc., 126 F.3d 1420, 1426 
(Fed.Cir.1997) (“If a litigant seeks to show 
error in a trial court's overlooking an argument, 
it must first present that argument to 
the trial court. In short, this court does not 
‘review’ that which was not presented to 
the district court.”). 
FN4. At oral argument, TransCore argued 
that “a contention of infringement ... is not 
enough for an implied license.” Oral Arg. 
at 39:31-39:35. This argument misses the 
mark. TransCore's contentions did not create 
the implied license; they merely serve

as evidence that TransCore sought to enforce 
the '946 patent in derogation of the 
rights it granted under the TransCore-Mark 
IV settlement agreement. That attempted 
derogation is prevented by legal estoppel, 
which gives rise to the implied license. 

Mark IV's rights under its implied license to 
the '946 patent are necessarily coextensive with the 
rights it received in *1280 the TransCore-Mark IV 
license agreement. Mark IV's sales to ISTHA were 
thus authorized and, accordingly, exhausted 
TransCore's patent rights in the products sold. 

CONCLUSION 

The district court's decision, granting summary 
judgment and thus dismissing TransCore's claims, 
is affirmed.

April 3, 2009. 


Background: Owners of patent claiming methods 
comprising the single step of reducing Nuclear 
Factor Kappa B (NF-KB) activity in eukaryotic 
cells brought infringement action against competitor. 
After a jury found infringement, and concluded 
that the asserted claims were not invalid for anticipation, 
lack of enablement, or lack of written description, 
the United States District Court for the 
District of Massachusetts, Rya W. Zobel, J., 529 
F.Supp.2d 106, denied competitor's motion for 
judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and a final 
judgment was entered, 2007 WL 2712087. Competitor 
appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) patent owners failed to provide adequate written 
description of the claims; 
(2) fact that figure containing errors was left in application 
was insufficient to satisfy intent element 
of inequitable conduct claim; and 
(3) district court did not clearly err by finding no 
intent to deceive the Patent and Trademark Office 
(PTO) on part of co-inventor. 
Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

gris. The jury also concluded that the asserted 
claims were not invalid for anticipation, lack of enablement, 
or lack of written description. 

Both at the close of Ariad's case-in-chief and 
again after the jury verdict, Lilly moved for judgment 
as a matter of law (JMOL) that the asserted 
claims were not infringed and were invalid for anticipation, 
lack of enablement, or lack of written description. 
Following a separate bench trial, the district 
court ruled that the asserted claims were directed 
to patentable subject matter and that the '516 
patent was not unenforceable due to inequitable 
conduct or prosecution laches. Ariad Pharms., Inc. 

v. Eli Lilly & Co., 529 F.Supp.2d 106 
(D.Mass.2007). Lilly appeals several rulings, including 
the court's denial of its JMOL motion and 
the court's ruling on inequitable conduct. For the 
reasons set forth below, we reverse-in-part and affirm-
in-part. 
BACKGROUND 

The technology in this case involves gene regulation. 
Transcription factors are molecules found in 
cells that regulate the extent to which genes are expressed. 
There are hundreds of different transcription 
factors that perform in concert with other molecules 
in the cell to control cellular behavior. Unsurprisingly, 
this network of cellular signals is fertile 
ground for the development of therapeutic compounds. 
In the mid-1980s, the inventors of the ' 516 
patent discovered an important transcription factor 
that they named NF-KB. NF-KB is akin to an all-
purpose cellular paramedic. When the cell receives 
a harmful extracellular influence, such as lipopolysaccha 
rides produced by bacteria, NF-KB is activated. 
Once activated, NF-KB travels to the nucleus 
of the cell and fulfills its role as a transcription 
factor, inducing the expression of numerous genes 
and causing the cell to produce the corresponding 
proteins. These proteins, for example certain cytokines, 
help the cell survive the extracellular influence, 
but they can be harmful in excess-not unlike 
how a fever is thought to combat infection but can 
cause harm if left unchecked. Once the offending 

extracellular influence diminishes, for example, following 
the administration of antibiotics for a bacterial 
infection,*1370 NF-KB activity decreases 
and the cell returns to its original state. 

The inventors of the '516 patent further realized 
that if NF-KB activity could be reduced artificially, 
it could ameliorate the harmful symptoms of diseases 
that trigger NF-KB activation-not unlike how 
aspirin can reduce a fever without actually treating 
the underlying infection. The asserted claims, rewritten 
to include the claims from which they depend, 
are as follows: 

80. [A method for modifying effects of external 
influences on a eukaryotic cell, which external 
influences induce NF-KB-mediated intracellular 
signaling, the method comprising altering NF-KB 
activity in the cells such that NF-KB-mediated 
effects of external influences are modified, 
wherein NF-KB activity in the cell is reduced] 
wherein reducing NF-KB activity comprises reducing 
binding of NF-KB to NF-KB recognition 
sites on genes which are transcriptionally regulated 
by NF-KB. 
95. [A method for reducing, in eukaryotic cells, 
the level of expression of genes which are activated 
by extracellular influences which induce NF-
KB-mediated intracellular signaling, the method 
comprising reducing NF-KB activity in the cells 
such that expression of said genes is reduced], 
carried out on human cells. 
144. [A method for reducing bacterial lipopolysaccharide-
induced expression of cytokines in 
mammalian cells, which method comprises reducing 
NF-KB activity in the cells so as to reduce 
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression 
of said cytokines in the cells] wherein reducing 
NF-KB activity comprises reducing binding of 
NF-KB to NF-KB recognition sites on genes 
which are transcriptionally regulated by NF-KB.

mammalian cells, which method comprises reducing 
NF-KB activity in the cells so as to reduce 
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression 
of said cytokines in the cells], carried out on human 
cells. 

Importantly, the district court determined that 
“reducing NF-KB activity” means “decreasing the 
function of NF-KB to act as an intracellular messenger 
that regulates transcription of particular 
genes, in response to certain stimuli.” Ariad 
Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., No. 02-cv-11280, 
2004 WL 413262, at *1, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
3170, at *3 (D.Mass. Mar. 3, 2004). Neither party 
appealed the district court's claim construction. 

Ariad filed its complaint on the day the '516 
patent issued, June 25, 2002. During the proceedings, 
the district court denied Lilly's combined motion 
to dismiss and motion for summary judgment. 
Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., No. 
02-cv-11280, 2003 WL 21087115, 2003 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 8030 (D.Mass. May 12, 2003). On April 4, 
2005, Lilly filed a request for reexamination of the ' 
516 patent. The district court denied Lilly's motion 
for a stay. Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 
No. 02-cv-11280, 2005 WL 1342721, 2005 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 10941 (D. Mass. June 6, 2005). The 
district court also denied Lilly's renewed motion to 
stay made on January 17, 2006. There was a fourteen-
day jury trial in April, 2006. At the close of 
Ariad's case-in-chief, Lilly moved for JMOL that 
the asserted claims were not infringed and were invalid 
for anticipation, lack of enablement, or lack of 
written description. The district court denied the 
JMOL motion without opinion. 

On April 28, 2006, the jury rendered a special 
verdict finding infringement of claims 80 and 95 
with respect to Evista and claims 144 and 145 with 
respect to Xigris. The jury also found that the asserted 
claims were not invalid for anticipation,*1371 
lack of enablement, or lack of written description. 
The court denied Lilly's renewed motion for JMOL 
or, in the alternative, a new trial, again without 
opinion. In August 2006, the court conducted a 

four-day bench trial on three further defenses 
offered by Lilly: unpatentable subject matter, inequitable 
conduct, and prosecution laches. The district 
court ruled in favor of Ariad on all three issues. 
Ariad Pharms., Inc., 529 F.Supp.2d 106. 

Lilly timely appeals all of these rulings except 
the district court's ruling that prosecution laches did 
not render the '516 patent unenforceable. We have 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).

for JMOL without deference. CytoLogix Corp. v.

(Fed.Cir.2005) (applying First Circuit law). Under 
First Circuit law, JMOL is warranted pursuant to 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1) where “there is no legally 
sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to 
find” for the non-moving party. Guilloty Perez v. 
Pierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.2003)

upon which the patent is based, and to 
demonstrate that the patentee was in possession of 
the invention that is claimed.” Capon v. Eshhar, 
418 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2005). The requirement 
“serves a teaching function, as a quid pro quo 
in which the public is given meaningful disclosure 
in exchange for being excluded from practicing the 
invention for a limited period of time.” Univ. of 
Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916, 922 
(Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-

O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 62, 121, 14 
L.Ed. 601 (1853) (explaining that a patentee “can

and if he claims more his patent is void”); 

Reiffin v. Microsoft Corp., 214 F.3d 1342, 1345-46 
(Fed.Cir.2000) (“The purpose of [the written description 
requirement] is to ensure that the scope of 
the right to exclude ... does not overreach the scope 
of the inventor's contribution to the field of art as 
described in the patent specification.”). 

[5][6] “To satisfy the written description requirement, 
‘the applicant does not have to utilize 
any particular form of disclosure to describe the 
subject matter claimed, but the description must 
clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to 
recognize that he or she invented what is claimed.’ 
” Carnegie Mellon Univ. v. Hoffmann-La Roche 
Inc., 541 F.3d 1115, 1122 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting 
In re Alton, 76 F.3d 1168, 1172 (Fed.Cir.1996)). 
“In other words, the applicant must ‘convey with 
reasonable clarity to those skilled in *1372 the art 
that, as of the filing date sought, he or she was in 
possession of the invention,’ and demonstrate that 
by disclosure in the specification of the patent.” Id. 
(quoting Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 
1555, 1563-64 (Fed.Cir.1991)). Such disclosure 
need not recite the claimed invention in haec verba, 
but it must do more than merely disclose that which 
would render the claimed invention obvious. 
Rochester, 358 F.3d at 923; Regents of the Univ. of 
Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559, 1566-67 
(Fed.Cir.1997); see also PowerOasis, Inc. v. T-

Mobile USA, Inc., 522 F.3d 1299, 1306-07 
(Fed.Cir.2008) (explaining that § 112, ¶ 1 “requires 
that the written description actually or inherently 
disclose the claim element”). 

[7][8] “Whether the written description requirement 
is satisfied is a fact-based inquiry that 
will depend on the nature of the claimed invention 
and the knowledge of one skilled in the art at the 
time an invention is made and a patent application 
is filed.” Carnegie Mellon, 541 F.3d at 1122 (citing 
Enzo, 323 F.3d at 963). The written description requirement 
is not satisfied by “[t]he appearance of 
mere indistinct words in a specification or a claim, 
even an original claim.... A description of what a 
material does, rather than of what it is, usually does 
not suffice.” Enzo, 323 F.3d at 968 (citing Eli Lilly, 
119 F.3d at 1568); see Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926 
(“[G]eneralized language may not suffice if it does 
not convey the detailed identity of an invention.”). 

[9] The same is true for both process claims 
and composition claims. Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926 
(“Regardless whether a compound is claimed per se 
or a method is claimed that entails the use of the 
compound, the inventor cannot lay claim to that 
subject matter unless he can provide a description 
of the compound sufficient to distinguish infringing 
compounds from non-infringing compounds, or infringing 
methods from non-infringing methods.”). 
Where the specification provides only constructive 
examples in lieu of working examples, it must still 
“describe the claimed subject matter in terms that 
establish that the applicant was in possession of the 
claimed invention, including all of the elements and 
limitations.” Id. (citing Hyatt v. Boone, 146 F.3d 
1348, 1353 (Fed.Cir.1998)). 
[10][11] Of course, what is adequate depends 
upon the context of the claimed invention. See Capon, 
418 F.3d at 1358 (“The written description requirement 
must be applied in the context of the particular 
invention and state of the knowledge.”). We 
have articulated a variety of factors to evaluate the 
adequacy of the disclosure supporting “generic 
claims to biological subject matter.” Id. at 1359.

These factors include “the existing knowledge in 
the particular field, the extent and content of the 
prior art, the maturity of the science or technology, 
[and] the predictability of the aspect at issue.” Id. 

Ariad explains that developing the subject matter 
of the '516 patent “required years of hard work, 
great skill, and extraordinary creativity-so much so 
that the inventors first needed to discover, give 
names to, and describe previously unknown cellular 
components as a necessary predicate for their inventions.” 
Lilly offered the undisputed expert testimony 
of David Latchman that the field of the invention 
was particularly unpredictable. Thus, this 
invention was made in a new and unpredictable 
field where the existing knowledge and prior art 
was scant. See Capon, 418 F.3d at 1359. 

A. 
[12] Ariad claims methods comprising the 
single step of reducing NF-KB activity. Lilly argues 
that the asserted claims are not supported by 
written description because*1373 the specification 
of the '516 patent fails to adequately disclose how 
the claimed reduction of NF-KB activity is 
achieved. The parties agree that the specification of 
the '516 patent hypothesizes three classes of molecules 
potentially capable of reducing NF-KB 
activity: specific inhibitors, dominantly interfering 
molecules, and decoy molecules. Lilly contends 
that this disclosure amounts to little more than a research 
plan, and does not satisfy the patentee's quid 
pro quo as described in Rochester. Ariad responds 
that Lilly's arguments fail as a matter of law because 
Ariad did not actually claim the molecules. 
According to Ariad, because there is no term in the 
asserted claims that corresponds to the molecules, it 
is entitled to claim the methods without describing 
the molecules. Ariad's legal assertion, however, is 
flawed. 
In Rochester, we held very similar method 
claims invalid for lack of written description. Id. 
(holding patent invalid because “Rochester did not 
present any evidence that the ordinarily skilled artisan 
would be able to identify any compound based 

on [the specification's] vague functional description”); 
see also Fiers v. Revel, 984 F.2d 1164, 
1170-71 (Fed.Cir.1993) (holding a claim to a genus 
of DNA molecules not supported by written description 
of a method for obtaining the molecules); 
cf. Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1567-68 (holding claims to 
a broad genus of genetic material invalid because 
the specification disclosed only one particular species). 
Ariad attempts to categorically distinguish 
Rochester, Fiers, and Eli Lilly, because in those 
cases, the claims explicitly included the non-
described compositions. For example, in Rochester, 
the method claims recited a broad type of compound 
that we held was inadequately described in 
the specification of the patent: 

1. A method for selectively inhibiting PGHS-2 
activity in a human host, comprising administering 
a non-steroidal compound that selectively inhibits 
activity of the PGHS-2 gene product to a 
human host in need of such treatment. 
Id. at 918 (emphasis added). Ariad's attempt to 
distinguish these cases is unavailing. Regardless of 
whether the asserted claims recite a compound, 
Ariad still must describe some way of performing 
the claimed methods, and Ariad admits that the specification 
suggests only the use of the three classes 
of molecules to achieve NF-KB reduction. Thus, to 
satisfy the written description requirement for the 
asserted claims, the specification must demonstrate 
that Ariad possessed the claimed methods by sufficiently 
disclosing molecules capable of reducing 
NF-KB activity so as to “satisfy the inventor's obligation 
to disclose the technologic knowledge upon 
which the patent is based, and to demonstrate that 
the patentee was in possession of the invention that 
is claimed.” Capon, 418 F.3d at 1357. 

B. 
[13] Alternatively, Ariad argues that the specification 
of the ' 516 patent and the expert testimony 
of Tom Kadesch provided the jury with substantial 
evidence of adequate written description of 
the claimed methods. “A determination that a patent 
is invalid for failure to meet the written descrip©

tion requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1 is a question 
of fact, and we review a jury's determinations 
of facts relating to compliance with the written description 
requirement for substantial evidence.” 

PIN/NIP, Inc. v. Platte Chem. Co., 304 F.3d 1235, 
1243 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing Vas-Cath, 935 F.2d at 
1563). 

Much of Ariad's written description evidence, 
however, is legally irrelevant to the question of 
whether the disclosure of the '516 patent conveys to 
those skilled in the art that the inventors were in 
possession of the claimed invention on April 21, 
*1374 1989-the effective filing date of the '516 patent. 
The parties disputed the effective filing date of 
the '516 patent, and in a detailed and well-crafted 
special verdict form, the jury was asked to choose 
between the two possible dates: April 21, 1989 and 
November 13, 1991. The jury chose 1989 and 
neither party appealed that determination. Presumably 
because of uncertainty over the priority date, 
much of Ariad's evidence was actually directed to 
the later date. Because written description is determined 
as of the filing date-April 21, 1989 in this 
case-evidence of what one of ordinary skill in the 
art knew in 1990 or 1991 cannot provide substantial 
evidence to the jury that the asserted claims were 
supported by adequate written description. See Vas-
Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64 (holding that a written 
description analysis occurs “as of the filing date 
sought”). 

In accordance with Rochester, the '516 patent 
must adequately describe the claimed methods for 
reducing NF-KB activity, including adequate description 
of the molecules that Ariad admits are necessary 
to perform the methods. The specification 
of the '516 patent hypothesizes three classes of molecules 
potentially capable of reducing NF-KB 
activity: specific inhibitors, dominantly interfering 
molecules, and decoy molecules. We review the 
specification's disclosure of each in turn to determine 
whether there is substantial evidence to support 
the jury's verdict that the written description evidenced 
that the inventor possessed the claimed in


vention. 

Specific inhibitors are molecules that are “able 
to block (reduce or eliminate) NF-KB binding” to 
DNA in the nucleus. '516 patent col.37 ll.44-45. 
The only example of a specific inhibitor given in 
the specification is I-KB, a naturally occurring molecule 
whose function is to hold NF-KB in an inactive 
state until the cell receives certain external influences. 
Id. at col.37 ll.48-49. Nearly all of Ariad's 
evidence regarding the disclosure of I-KB relies 
upon figure 43. Ariad's expert, Dr. Kadesch, testified 
that figure 43 discloses the sequence of DNA 
that encodes I-KB and relied on this disclosure with 
regard to his opinion that the written description requirement 
was satisfied by disclosure of specific inhibitor 
molecules. See Trial Tr. 53; 57-58; 60; 
78-85, Apr. 27, 2006. But as Ariad admits, figure 
43 was not disclosed until 1991. Because figure 43 
was not in the 1989 application, neither it nor Dr. 
Kadesch's testimony regarding it can offer substantial 
evidence for the jury determination. See Vas-
Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64. The only other testimony 
of Dr. Kadesch with regard to I-KB was that 
it existed in 1989 and that one of ordinary skill 
could through experimentation isolate natural I-KB. 
See Trial Tr. at 62-85. In the context of this invention, 
a vague functional description and an invitation 
for further research does not constitute written 

FN1

disclosure of a specific inhibitor.See Eli Lilly, 
119 F.3d at 1566 (holding that written description 
requires more than a “mere wish or plan for obtaining 
the claimed chemical invention”); see also id. at 
1567 (“[A] description which renders obvious a 
claimed invention is not sufficient to satisfy the 
written description requirement of that invention.”). 
And it certainly does not *1375 constitute written 
disclosure of a method for reducing NF-KB activity 
using I-KB. 

FN1. Moreover, the district court found, in 
the context of its inequitable conduct ruling, 
that figure 43 is both incorrect and incomplete.

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366) 

That the inventors of the '516 patent, 
among the most skilled artisans in their 
field in the world at this time, failed to correctly 
disclose the structure of I-B even 

K

two years after the application was filed is 
a strong sign that one of skill in the art 
could not be expected to provide this 
knowledge in 1989. 

Dominantly interfering molecules are “a truncated 
form of the NF-KB molecule.” '516 patent 
col.38 l.11. The truncation would “retain[ ] the 
DNA binding domain, but lack[ ] the RNA polymerase 
activating domain.” Id. at col.38 ll.13-14. 
As such, the dominantly interfering molecule 
“would recognize and bind to the NF-KB binding 
site [on nuclear DNA], however, the binding would 
be unproductive.” Id. at col.38 ll.15-17. In other 
words, the dominantly interfering molecules would 
block natural NF-KB from inducing the expression 
of its target genes. The specification provides no 
example molecules of this class. Moreover, the specification 
acknowledges that dominantly interfering 
molecules can work only “if the DNA binding domain 
and the DNA polymerase domain of NF-KB 
are spatially distinct in the molecule.” Id. at col.38 
ll.9-10 (emphasis added). The jury also heard Dr. 
Kadesch's testimony that “it is a fair representation” 
that “the '516 patent itself doesn't disclose in its text 
that the DNA binding domain and the RNA preliminary 
activating domain of NF-KB are, in fact, separable 
or spatially distinct.” Considering that the inventors 
of the '516 patent discovered NF-KB, if 
they did not know whether the two domains are distinct, 
one of ordinary skill in the art was at best 
equally ignorant. Perhaps one of ordinary skill 
could discover this information, but this does not 
alter our conclusion that the description of the dominantly 
interfering molecules “just represents a 
wish, or arguably a plan” for future research. Fiers, 
984 F.2d at 1171; see Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1567 
(rendering obvious is insufficient for written description). 
Nor is it sufficient, as Ariad argues, that 
“skilled workers actually practiced this teaching 
soon after the 1989 application was filed.” See Vas-

Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64 (holding that a written 
description analysis occurs “as of the filing date 
sought”). 

Decoy molecules are “designed to mimic a region 
of the gene whose expression would normally 
be induced by NF-KB. In this case, NF-KB would 
bind the decoy, and thus, not be available to bind its 
natural target.” '516 patent col.37 ll.51-54. Like the 
other two classes of molecules, decoy molecules 
are presented hypothetically, but unlike the other 
two classes of molecules, the specification proposes 
example structures for decoy molecules. Id. at 
col.37 tbl.2. As Dr. Kadesch explained, decoy molecules 
are DNA oligonucleotides, and because the 
specification discloses specific example sequences, 
there is little doubt that the specification adequately 
described the actual molecules to one of ordinary 
skill in the art. Yet this does not answer the question 
of whether the specification adequately describes 
using those molecules to reduce NF-KB 
activity. The full extent of the specification's disclosure 
of a method that reduces NF-KB activity 
using decoy molecules is that NF-KB “would bind 
the decoy” and thereby, “negative regulation can be 
effected.” Id. at col.37 ll.50-54. Prophetic examples 
are routinely used in the chemical arts, and they 
certainly can be sufficient to satisfy the written description 
requirement. But this disclosure is not so 
much an “example” as it is a mere mention of a desired 
outcome. As Dr. Latchman pointed out, there 
is no descriptive link between the table of decoy 
molecules and reducing NF-KB activity. 

Ariad also relies upon “[a] 1990 publication in 
evidence [that] reported using decoy molecules to 
reduce NF-KB activity” which was discussed by 
Dr. Kadesch. Appellee Br. 25-26. Again, because 
the priority date was determined to be 1989, the 
disclosure in a later publication cannot, as a matter 
of law, establish that the inventor in this case possessed 
using decoy molecules*1376 to reduce NFKB 
when the patent application was filed in 1989. 
Dr. Kadesch's reliance on this evidence as support 

FN2

for his opinion is likewise erroneous.

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366) 

FN2. Dr. Kadesch testified that the scientists 
who conducted the decoy molecule 
study published in November 1990 would 
likely have mastered their technique prior 
to the filing of the '516 patent application 
in April 1989. Perhaps so, but this fact is 
not in evidence, and even if it were true, 
one research group does not necessarily 
represent the knowledge of one of ordinary 
skill in the art without further testimony to 
support that contention. 

We reviewed all other portions of Dr. Kadesch's 
testimony that Ariad contends provided the 
jury with substantial evidence relating to each of 
the three classes of molecules, and we deem them 

FN3

insufficient as a matter of law. Indeed, most of 
the testimony cited by Ariad was irrelevant to the 
question of whether the inventors were in possession 
of the claimed invention as of the 1989 priority 
date. The '516 patent discloses no working or even 
prophetic examples of methods that reduce NF-KB 
activity, and no completed syntheses of any of the 
molecules prophesized to be capable of reducing 
NF-KB activity. The state of the art at the time of 
filing was primitive and uncertain, leaving Ariad 
with an insufficient supply of prior art knowledge 
with which to fill the gaping holes in its disclosure. 
See Capon, 418 F.3d at 1358 (“It is well-recognized 
that in the unpredictable fields of science, it is appropriate 
to recognize the variability in the science 
in determining the scope of the coverage to which 
the inventor is entitled.”). 

FN3. Dr. Kadesch certainly offered a general 
conclusion that he thought the inventors 
were in possession of the claimed invention 
in 1989. This conclusory testimony, 
as shown infra, is devoid of any factual 
content upon which the jury could 
have relied when considering the specification 
of the '516 patent, and therefore cannot 
constitute substantial evidence. Besides, 
possession of an invention must be 
shown by written description in the patent 

application, and that was not shown here. 
See Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926 (“After all, 
it is in the patent specification where the 
written description requirement must be 
met.”). 

Whatever thin thread of support a jury might 
find in the decoy-molecule hypothetical simply 
cannot bear the weight of the vast scope of these 
generic claims. See LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res. 
Mapping, Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2005) 
(holding that “[a]fter reading the patent, a person of 
skill in the art would not understand” the patentee 
to have invented a generic method where the patent 
only disclosed one embodiment of it); Reiffin, 214 
F.3d at 1345-46 (noting that the “scope of the right 
to exclude” must not “overreach the scope of the inventor's 
contribution to the field of art as described 
in the patent specification”); Fiers, 984 F.2d at 
1171 (“Claiming all DNA[s] that achieve a result 
without defining what means will do so is not in 
compliance with the description requirement; it is 
an attempt to preempt the future before it has arrived.”); 
cf. Carnegie Mellon, 541 F.3d at 1126 
(holding that the narrow description of the E. coli 
polA gene did not adequately support a broad claim 
to the gene from any bacterial source). Here, the 
specification at best describes decoy molecule 
structures and hypothesizes with no accompanying 
description that they could be used to reduce NFKB 
activity. Yet the asserted claims are far broader. 
We therefore conclude that the jury lacked substantial 
evidence for its verdict that the asserted claims 
were supported by adequate written description, 
and thus hold the asserted claims invalid. 

Ariad sought and obtained the broad claims we 
now hold to be invalid. For its own reasons, Ariad 
maintained the breadth of these claims through 
claim construction and into trial. As Judge Rader 
observed, *1377 the situation presented in this case 
should not often occur, because “[i]n simple terms, 
a court would properly interpret the claim[s] as limited.”

denial of petition for rehearing en banc). Nonetheless, 
as it stands, Ariad chose to assert claims that 
are broad far beyond the scope of the disclosure 
provided in the specification of the '516 patent. Cf. 
Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 481 F.3d 
1371, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2007) (“The motto, ‘beware of 
what one asks for,’ might be applicable here.”). 

II. 
[14] We next turn to Lilly's appeal of the district 
court's ruling that Lilly failed to establish the 
affirmative defense of inequitable conduct. “We review 
the district court's findings on the issues of 
materiality and intent for clear error. The ultimate 
decision regarding inequitable conduct is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.” Rentrop v. Spectranetics 
Corp., No.2007-1560, 550 F.3d 1112, 1120 
(Fed.Cir. Dec.18, 2008). 
[15] Lilly bears the burden of proving inequitable 
conduct. Ulead Sys., Inc. v. Lex Computer & 
Mgmt. Corp., 351 F.3d 1139, 1146 (Fed.Cir.2003). 
To successfully prove inequitable conduct, Lilly 
must present “evidence that the applicant (1) made 
an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact, 
failed to disclose material information, or submitted 
false material information, and (2) intended to deceive 
the [USPTO].” Cargill, Inc. v. Canbra Foods, 
Ltd., 476 F.3d 1359, 1364-65 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing 
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc., 468 F.3d 
1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006)). 
[16] “Further, at least a threshold level of each 
element-i.e., both materiality and intent to deceive-
must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.” 
Star Scientific, Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
537 F.3d 1357, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2008). “If a threshold 
level of intent to deceive or materiality is not established 
by clear and convincing evidence, the district 
court does not have any discretion to exercise and 
cannot hold the patent unenforceable regardless of 
the relative equities or how it might balance them.” 
Id. Lilly alleges that two errors gave rise to inequitable 
conduct. On appeal, Ariad does not dispute the 
substance or materiality of the errors. Rather, relying 
on Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles Machine 

Works, Lilly challenges the district court's finding 
that neither error was accompanied by an intent to 
deceive. 437 F.3d 1309, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2006) (“[A] 
greater showing of [materiality] allow[s for] a lesser 
showing of [intent].”). Unless otherwise noted, 
the facts are taken from the district court's detailed 
opinion. Ariad Pharms., Inc., 529 F.Supp.2d at 
121-36. 

A. 
[17] The first of the two errors underlying 
Lilly's defense of inequitable conduct relates to figure 
43 of the '516 patent. Ariad does not dispute the 
district court's finding that figure 43 is incorrect. 
The patent describes figure 43 as “[t]he nucleotide 
sequence of the I-KB-á gene and the amino acid sequence 
of I-KB-á.” '516 patent col.28 ll.16-17. The 
district court found that one of ordinary skill in the 
art would, given the context, infer that the gene in 
figure 43 is that of a mouse or other mammal. 
There are two errors in the figure: the sequence is 
both incomplete and from a chicken as opposed to a 
mouse or other mammalian organism. The district 
court further found that the errors were material because 
during prosecution, Ariad and the examiner 
relied on figure 43 for certain arguments to overcome 
§ 112 rejections. Ariad does not dispute the 
materiality of the errors. According to Lilly, *1378 
the district court clearly erred because Ariad and 
the prosecuting attorneys were aware of the errors 
in figure 43 and purposely concealed them from the 
USPTO at the “crowning moment” of the prosecution 
of the '516 patent. 
Figure 43 was added to the specification of a 
predecessor application of the '516 patent in 1991. 
Without detailing the full lineage, it is sufficient to 
note that several related applications in the family 
contained figure 43. In 1997, an employee of Ariad, 
Sharon Hausdorff, informed Lisa Warren, an attorney 
with Hamilton, Brooks, Smith & Reynolds, 
P.C., that figure 43 contained errors. Ms. Warren 
succeeded in deleting figure 43 from at least one 
application on file with the USPTO. Around the 
same time, the prosecution files for the family of

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366) 

applications were transferred to Matthew Vincent at 
Foley, Hoag & Elliot LLP. 

Dr. Vincent delegated the work to Isabelle 
Clauss. Dr. Clauss handled the “ministerial” actions, 
including, upon learning of the errors from 
Ms. Hausdorff, removing figure 43 from two more 
of the related applications. Although Dr. Vincent 
testified that he was never aware of the errors in 
figure 43 during the pendency of the application 
that led to the '516 patent, Dr. Clauss testified that 
she had discussed the issue regarding figure 43 with 
him. The district court credited Dr. Vincent's testimony 
because Dr. Class was “at best, equivocal” 
and was uncertain about the timing and substance 
of the conversations. In 1998, Dr. Vincent filed a 
response to an office action regarding the '516 patent 
application. While apparently not referencing 
figure 43, Dr. Vincent made arguments relating to § 
112 that would be furthered by figure 43. Dr. 
Clauss also filed a similar response in 1999, arguing 
that the specification of the application disclosed 
I-KBencoding DNA. Although she did not 
reference it explicitly, she could only have been referring 
to the contents of figure 43. 

In 2001, Dr. Vincent moved to Ropes & Gray 
LLP, taking with him all of the related applications. 
Dr. Clauss did not move to Ropes & Gray LLP and 
did no further work on the Ariad patent applications. 
After this, no further corrections were made, 
and the '516 patent issued in 2002 with figure 43 included. 


[18] The district court did not clearly err by 
finding no intent to deceive the USPTO by Ms. 
Hausdorff, Dr. Vincent, or Dr. Clauss. While it is 
true that “because direct evidence of deceptive intent 
is rarely available, such intent can be inferred 
from indirect and circumstantial evidence[,] ... such 
evidence must still be clear and convincing, and inferences 
drawn from lesser evidence cannot satisfy 
the deceptive intent requirement.” Star Scientific, 
537 F.3d at 1366. 
Dr. Vincent never knew of the errors. Thus, to 

the extent that he may have relied on figure 43 in 
his communications with the USPTO, this is insufficient 
evidence of intent to deceive. Ms. Hausdorff 
knew, but there is no other evidence that Ms. Hausdorff 
had any intent to conceal the errors from the 
USPTO. To the contrary, she disclosed the errors to 
her attorneys. She was justified in her expectation 
that her attorneys would determine the legal significance 
of the errors and take appropriate actions. 
Dr. Clauss also knew of the errors, but the district 
court credited Dr. Clauss's testimony that she was 
following Foley, Hoag & Elliot LLP's standard 
practice to make the correction only after the PTO 
indicated the claims were allowable in any particular 
related application. That knowledge of the errors 
was lost when Dr. Vincent moved to Ropes & Gray 
LLP does not rise to the level of intent to deceive. 

See *1379Kingsdown Med. Consultants, Ltd. v. 
Hollister Inc., 863 F.2d 867, 876 (Fed.Cir.1988) (en 
banc) (holding even gross negligence insufficient to 
prove intent to deceive). While Dr. Clauss's 1999 
office action response could be the seed of a finding 
of intent, more evidence of deliberate concealment 
would be needed and this fact alone does not 
constitute “clear error” in the district court fact 
finding. 

Lilly argues that the fact that figure 43 was left 
in the one application that issued as the '516 patent 
is sufficiently suspicious that it should contribute to 
a finding of intent. We disagree. It appears that the 
parties involved endeavored to correct figure 43 
throughout the family of applications. These actions 
do not signal a nefarious plot to leave figure 43 in 
the one application that would lead to the patent 
now asserted; rather, they signal an honest but imperfect 
attempt to correct mistakes. Certainly, deceptive 
intent is not “the single most reasonable inference 
able to be drawn from the evidence.” Star 
Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1366. There is simply no 
evidence of what Lilly contends is “purposeful concealment” 
no matter how material the errors might 
be.

[19] The second of the two errors underlying 
Lilly's defense of inequitable conduct relates to the 
failure to submit four references to the USPTO during 
the prosecution of the '516 patent application. 
The references were not prior art per se; they were 
scientific papers published after the filing date of 
the '516 patent application and authored or coauthored 
by one of the patent's co-inventors, Albert 
Baldwin. The references discuss the impact of various 
compounds on NF-B activity. According to 
K

Lilly, the references are relevant to the issue of 
whether certain claims are inherently anticipated by 
these prior art compounds. Ariad does not dispute 
the district court's finding that the omissions were 
material. Lilly argues that Ariad intentionally concealed 
the references, pointing to testimony by Dr. 
Baldwin that he knew the references were relevant 
to the subject matter of the '516 patent application. 
Lilly does not claim that any other person had the 
requisite intent. 

There is no doubt that Dr. Baldwin was aware 
of the references, because he authored them. He 
testified as follows: 

Q. Did you at any time consider disclosing your 
findings regarding Resveratrol in those experiments 
to the United States Patent Office? 
A. I mean I-I considered it, but I-again, I feel like 
that one would inundate the patent office with 
every report of-of things that affect NF-KB one 
way or the other. It's-you can do a search on NFKB 
and it's endless. 
Q. Why is it you considered disclosing your findings 
regarding the effect of Resveratrol in your 
experiments to the United States Patent Office? 
A. Well, we signed-we signed this document that 
says that was our obligation to do so at some 
point. 
Dr. Baldwin-who is a scientist and not a patent 
lawyer-was apparently aware of his duty to disclose, 
and also aware that it could be inappropriate 

to submit material that might “inundate” the 
USPTO. His reasons for not submitting the references 
are plausible, even if ultimately legally incorrect, 
and Lilly failed to show that deceptive intent 
was the better explanation for Dr. Baldwin's behavior. 
Lilly failed to show that Dr. Baldwin had any 
knowledge of how the statements about the effect 
of prior art compounds on NF-KB activity made in 
the references could impact the '516 patent application. 
Lilly did not show that Dr. Baldwin appreciated 
the inherent anticipation theory to which the 
references allegedly pertained. And even if Lilly 
had shown this knowledge, it did not show that Dr. 
Baldwin had any knowledge of the historical uses 
of the prior art compounds. *1380 Accordingly, we 
conclude that the district court did not clearly err by 
finding no intent to deceive the USPTO on the part 
of Dr. Baldwin. 

C. 
[20][21] Lilly cannot prove deceptive intent by 
clear and convincing evidence simply by relying on 
the materiality of the errors. Rather, there must be 
clear and convincing evidence of “culpable” conduct. 
Halliburton Co. v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 
925 F.2d 1435, 1443 (Fed.Cir.1991) (citing Consol. 
Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int'l Ltd., 910 F.2d 804, 
809 (Fed.Cir.1990)). Digital Control's statement 
that “a greater showing of [materiality] allow[s for] 
a lesser showing of [intent]” is not to the contrary. 
437 F.3d at 1313. Only after a district court makes 
independent findings of both materiality and intent 
may it weigh the two against each other in its ultimate 
determination of inequitable conduct. Materiality 
and intent are different requirements, and absent 
a finding of deceptive intent, no amount of materiality 
gives the district court discretion to find inequitable 
conduct. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365 
(“If a threshold level of intent to deceive or materiality 
is not established by clear and convincing 
evidence, the district court does not have any discretion 
to exercise and cannot hold the patent unenforceable 
regardless of the relative equities or 
how it might balance them.”); see Aventis Pharma

1350 (Fed.Cir.2008) (Rader, J., dissenting) 
(“Merging intent and materiality at levels far below 
the Kingsdown rule has revived the inequitable conduct 
tactic.”). “[C]ourts must be vigilant in not permitting 
the defense [of inequitable conduct] to be 
applied too lightly.” Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 
1366. Because Lilly failed to establish the 
“threshold level of intent to deceive ... by clear and 
convincing evidence,” the district correct correctly 
concluded that the '516 patent was not unenforceable 
due to inequitable conduct. Id. at 1365. 

CONCLUSION 

Because we hold that claims 80, 95, 144, and 
145 of the '516 patent are invalid for lack of written 
description, we need not address infringement or 
the other validity issues on appeal. We affirm the 
district court's ruling that the '516 patent is not unenforceable 
due to inequitable conduct. The judgment 
below is 

REVERSED-IN-PART AND AFFIRMEDIN-
PART. 

LINN, Circuit Judge, concurring. 

I join the opinion of the court because I concur 
that it is supported by our precedent. I write separately 
to emphasize, as I have before, my belief that 
our engrafting of a separate written description requirement 
onto section 112, paragraph 1 is misguided. 
See, e.g., Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle 
& Co., Inc., 375 F.3d 1303, 1325-27 (Fed.Cir.2004) 
(Linn, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en 
banc); Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe Inc., 323 
F.3d 956, 987-89 (Fed.Cir.2002) (Linn, J., dissenting 
from denial of rehearing en banc). As I observed 
in University of Rochester, section 112, 
paragraph 1 requires no more of the specification 
than a disclosure that is sufficient to enable a person 
having ordinary skill in the art to make and use 
the invention: 

Section 112 of Title 35 of the United States 
Code requires a written description of the invention, 
but the measure of the sufficiency of that 
written description in meeting the conditions of 

patentability in paragraph 1 of that statute depends 
solely on whether it enables any person 
skilled in the art to which the invention pertains 
to make and use the claimed invention and sets 
forth the best mode of carrying out the invention. 
The question presented by *138135 U.S.C. § 112, 
paragraph 1, is not, “Does the written description 
disclose what the invention is?” The question is, 
“Does the written description describe the invention 
recited in the claims-themselves part of the 
specification-in terms that are sufficient to enable 
one of skill in the art to make and use the claimed 
invention and practice the best mode contemplated 
by the inventor?” That is the mandate of 
the statute and is all our precedent demanded prior 
to Regents of the University of California v. 
Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559 (Fed.Cir.1997). 

375 F.3d at 1325. 

As both this court and the Supreme Court have 
recognized, the claims-not the specification-define 
the invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top 
Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 339, 81 S.Ct. 599, 
5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961) (“[T]he claims made in the 
patent are the sole measure of the grant.”); see also 

Johnson & Johnston Assocs. Inc. v. R.E. Serv. Co., 

285 F.3d 1046, 1052 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc) 
(“Consistent with its scope definition and notice 
functions, the claim requirement presupposes that a 
patent applicant defines his invention in the claims, 
not in the specification. After all, the claims, not 
the specification, provide the measure of the pat-
entee's right to exclude.”). The court's invention of 
a separate written description requirement has 
“create[d] confusion as to where the public and the 
courts should look to determine the scope of the 
patentee's right to exclude,” University of 
Rochester, 375 F.3d at 1326, causing uncertainty 
“in how inventions are protected, in how the [Patent 
& Trademark Office] discharges its responsibilities, 
and in how business is conducted in emerging 
fields of law,” id. at 1327. 

Aside from these general observations, I note 
that the written description requirement does separ

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366) 

ate mischief in this case. Because the court relies 
upon this requirement to reverse the district court, it 
does not reach the important enablement issue 
raised by Lilly. As the majority opinion observes, 
the claims-in-suit broadly claim any method for reducing 
NF-KB activity in cells, including both 
known and unknown methods. We have long held 
that in order to survive the enablement requirement, 
the specification “must describe the manner and 
process of making and using the invention so as to 
enable a person of skill in the art to make and use 
the full scope of the invention without undue experimentation.” 
LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res. Mapping, 
Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1344-45 (Fed.Cir.2005) 
(emphasis added); see also Invitrogen Corp. v. 
Clontech Labs., Inc., 429 F.3d 1052, 1070 
(Fed.Cir.2005). To my knowledge, however, we 
have not specifically addressed this requirement in 
relation to the type of claims at issue here-that is, 
claims written broadly enough to cover any method 
for achieving a particular result. It may be, as Lilly 
argues, that such a claim can never be valid, since 
the specification cannot enable unknown methods. 
Cf. In re Hyatt, 708 F.2d 712, 714 (Fed.Cir.1983) 
(rejecting “single means” claim, as such claims 
“cover[ ] every conceivable means for achieving 
the stated result”). This is an important issue that 
we have left unresolved. It is an issue that we 
would have been compelled to reach had the case 
been decided on enablement grounds, a basis found 
in section 112, instead of on written description 
grounds, a separate basis not justified under that 
section or any other provision of the Patent Act.

Federal Circuit. 
In re Martin GLEAVE and Maxim Signaevsky. 


No. 2008-1453. 
March 26, 2009. 


Background: Examiner rejected some claims in 
patent application as indefinite and others as anticipated 
or obvious. The Patent and Trademark Office 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, 
2008 WL 867799, reversed examiner's indefinite 
rejection and affirmed anticipated or obvious rejection. 
Applicants petitioned for judicial review. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) prior patent application that disclosed general 
concepts regarding antisense oligonucleotides was 
enabling disclosure; 
(2) evidence as to whether particular prior art compounds 
worked for their intended purpose was irrelevant 
to anticipation analysis; and 
(3) prior art reference that listed every 15-base 
sense oligodeoxynucleotide in known nucleic acid 
sequence anticipated and rendered obvious claims 
to specific antisense sequences having particular 
properties. 
Affirmed.

(collectively, “Gleave”) filed U.S. Patent Application 
No. 10/346,493 (“'493 application”) on January 
17, 2003. The examiner rejected claims 1, 4, 15, 
and 18-21 as indefinite under 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2 
and as anticipated or obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 
102(b)/103(a). The United States Patent and Trademark 
Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
(“Board”) reversed the examiner's § 112, ¶ 2 
rejection and affirmed the § 102(b)/103(a) rejection. 
*1333 Ex parte Gleave, No.2007-4154, 2008 
WL 867799 (B.P.A.I. Mar. 31, 2008). Gleave appeals 
the § 102/103 rejections. For the reasons set 
forth below, we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 
Gleave's '493 application is entitled “Bispecific 
Antisense Olignucleotides [sic] that Inhibit IGFBP


FN1

2 and IGFBP-5 and Methods of Using Same.” 
The claims are based on the understanding that certain 
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can simultaneously 
bind to and prevent the translation of mRNA 
into two types of human Insulin-Dependent Growth 
Factor Binding Protein (“IGFBP”). The application 
claims antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, methods of 
making pharmaceutical compounds containing the 
oligodeoxynucleotides, and methods of treating endocrine-
regulated cancers by using the oligodeoxynucleotides 
to prevent the formation of IGFBP-2 
and IGFBP-5. The examiner rejected claims 1, 4, 
15, and 18-21, all of which were composition 
claims directed to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. 

FN1. We described antisense technology in 
greater detail in Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Cal-
gene, Inc., 188 F.3d 1362 (Fed.Cir.1999), 
and thus only give a brief overview for 
purposes of this opinion. In double-stranded 
deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”), only 
particular segments (called genes) actually 
encode proteins. Typically, this double-
stranded DNA is “transcribed” into messenger 
ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), which 
is complementary to one strand of the 
DNA. This mRNA then moves into the ribosome, 
where the mRNA is “translated” 

into a series of amino acids. Together, 
these amino acids form a single protein. 
Antisense technology is used to interrupt 
this process, thereby preventing certain 
proteins from being synthesized by the 
cell. Short segments of single-stranded 
DNA (called oligodeoxynucleotides) that 
are complementary to the mRNA are introduced, 
and physically bind to the mRNA. 
This prevents the mRNA from being translated 
into a protein. Some of these oligodeoxynucleotides 
are “bispecific,” 
meaning that they can bind to mRNAs 
transcribed from two distinct genes and 
prevent the formation of both proteins. 

The Board selected claims 1 and 4 as representative. 
Claim 1 recites 

[a] bispecific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, 
wherein substantially all of the oligodeoxynucleotide 
is complementary to a portion of a gene 
encoding human IGFBP-2 and substantially all of 
the oligodeoxynucleotide is also complementary 
to a gene encoding human IGFBP-5, and wherein 
the oligodeoxynucleotide is of sufficient length to 
act as an antisense inhibitor of human IGFBP-2 
and human IGFBP-5. 
Claim 4 recites “[t]he antisense oligodeoxynucleotide 
according to claim 1, wherein the oligodeoxynucleotide 
consists essentially of a series 
of bases as set forth in any of Seq. ID. Nos. 3 
through 7.” Those sequences range from eighteen to 
twenty-two DNA bases in length. Before the examiner, 
Gleave elected Sequence No. 5, a twenty-base 
oligodeoxynucleotide. The specification notes that 
the invention does not exclude “minor modifications 
in sequence, such as the addition of one or 
two terminal bases, or single base substitutions 
which might depart from perfect complementarity.” 

The examiner initially rejected the claims over 
the published PCT application 00/78341 of Wraight 
et al. (“Wraight”). In Wraight, the applicants listed 
every fifteen-base-long sense oligodeoxynucleotide

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1331) 

in the IGFBP-2 gene. The list includes more than 
1400 sequences. Wraight also disclosed the general 
concepts that antisense oligonucleotides are preferably 
between fifteen and twenty-five bases in 
length, and that some antisense oligonucleotides 
may be bispecific (i.e., capable of inhibiting “an 
IGFBP such as IGFBP-2 and/or IGFBP-3”). Finally, 
Wraight states that “[a]ntisense oligonucleotides 
to IGFBP-2 may be selected from molecules 
capable of interacting with one or more” of 
*1334 the sense oligonucleotides described in the 
long list. 

The Board found that to anticipate claim 1, the 
prior art had to describe an oligodeoxynucleotide of 
sufficient length to act as an antisense inhibitor to 
human IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5, and substantially all 
of the oligodeoxynucleotide had to be complementary 
to a portion of the gene encoding human IGFBP-
2 and complementary to the gene encoding human 
IGFBP-5. The Board found that Wraight satisfied 
these requirements and anticipated the claims. 
The Board also affirmed the § 103 rejection. 

The issue presented on appeal, therefore, is 
whether a reference that lists every fifteen-base 
sense oligodeoxynucleotide in a known nucleic acid 
sequence anticipates or renders obvious claims to 
specific antisense sequences having particular properties. 
We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 
28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(4)(A). 

DISCUSSION 

As an initial matter, the parties disagree over 
the proper standard of review. Under 35 U.S.C. § 
102(b), a patent applicant cannot receive a patent if 
the invention was “described in a printed publication 
in this or a foreign country ... more than one 
year prior to the date of the application for patent in 
the United States.” Gleave claims that the issue at 
hand is “in essence” one of statutory construction 
(i.e., what a reference must disclose to “describe” 
an invention under § 102(b)); thus, Gleave argues 

FN2

we should review the Board's decision de novo.
Yet Gleave has not unearthed for us some previously 
hidden requirement for a reference to anticip


ate an invention under § 102(b). 

FN2. The PTO argued that Gleave “waived 
review of the legal issue he now asserts by 
failing to raise it before the Board.” We 
disagree. The entire thrust of Gleave's brief 
on appeal to the Board was the 
“significance” of Wraight's disclosure in 
an anticipation analysis. Gleave argued 
this position as early as his first office action 
response on March 12, 2005. 

[1][2] A reference is anticipatory under § 
102(b) when it satisfies particular requirements. 
First, the reference must disclose each and every 
element of the claimed invention, whether it does 
so explicitly or inherently. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith 
Goldline Pharms., Inc., 471 F.3d 1369, 1375 
(Fed.Cir.2006). While those elements must be 
“arranged or combined in the same way as in the 
claim,” Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 
F.3d 1359, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2008), the reference need 
not satisfy an ipsissimis verbis test, In re Bond, 910 
F.2d 831, 832-33 (Fed.Cir.1990). Second, the reference 
must “enable one of ordinary skill in the art to 
make the invention without undue experimentation.” 
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc., 
545 F.3d 1312, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2008); see In re 
LeGrice, 49 C.C.P.A. 1124, 301 F.2d 929, 940-44 
(1962). As long as the reference discloses all of the 
claim limitations and enables the “subject matter 
that falls within the scope of the claims at issue,” 
the reference anticipates-no “actual creation or reduction 
to practice” is required. Schering Corp. v. 
Geneva Pharms., Inc., 339 F.3d 1373, 1380-81 
(Fed.Cir.2003); see In re Donohue, 766 F.2d 531, 
533 (Fed.Cir.1985). This is so despite the fact that 
the description provided in the anticipating reference 
might not otherwise entitle its author to a patent. 
See Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 
1562 (Fed.Cir.1991) (discussing the “distinction 
between a written description adequate to support a 
claim under § 112 and a written description sufficient 
to anticipate its subject matter under § 102(b) 
”).

[3][4] As this summary makes clear, the outcome 
in this case depends largely on the facts. 
After all, anticipation is a *1335 question of fact, 
including whether an element is inherent in the prior 
art. Eli Lilly, 471 F.3d at 1375. And as with 35 

U.S.C. § 112, “[w]hether a prior art reference is enabling 
is a question of law based upon underlying 
factual findings.” Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. 
Chemque, Inc., 303 F.3d 1294, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2002) 
. We review the Board's factual determinations for 
substantial evidence. In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 
1315 (Fed.Cir.2000). The Board's legal conclusions, 
on the other hand, we review de novo. In re 
Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125, 1127 (Fed.Cir.2004). 

A 

Gleave frames the issue presented for review as 
“the meaning of the term ‘described’ in 35 U.S.C. § 
102(b) and the type of disclosure that is therefore 
required for a reference to be anticipatory.” Specifically, 
Gleave claims that “Wraight does not describe 
any particular individual antisense species,” 
because Wraight merely gives the public “ink, 
formed into strings of letters, without inventive 
thought and without placing the public in possession 
of anything new. There is no guidance to make 
particular selections, and no understanding of 
which of the targets would be useful, and what the 
properties of the related antisense would be.” 

[5] We have at times framed the issue of enablement 
under § 102 as a question of whether one 
of ordinary skill in the art would know how to 
“make and use ” the invention based on the reference's 
disclosure. See, e.g., Impax Labs., Inc. v. 
Aventis Pharms., Inc., 468 F.3d 1366, 1381 
(Fed.Cir.2006) (“[A] prior art reference must be enabling 
so that the claimed subject matter may be 
made or used by one skilled in the art.”); Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs., Inc., 246 
F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2001) ( “To anticipate, 
the reference must also enable one of skill in the art 
to make and use the claimed invention.”). Taken 
out of context, these formulations of our § 102 enablement 
standard arguably support a use or utility 
requirement divorced from any “make” requirement. 
A thorough reading of our case law, however, 
makes clear that a reference need disclose no independent 
use or utility to anticipate a claim under § 

102. E.g., Novo Nordisk Pharms., Inc. v. Bio-Tech. 
Gen. Corp., 424 F.3d 1347, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2005) 
(“The standard for enablement of a prior art reference 
for purposes of anticipation under [§ ]102 differs 
from the enablement standard under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 112.”); Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 
413 F.3d 1318, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2005) ( “[A] prior art 
reference need not demonstrate utility in order to 
serve as an anticipating reference under [§ ]102.”); 
In re Hafner, 56 C.C.P.A. 1424, 410 F.2d 1403, 
1405 (1969) (“[Section] 112 provides that the specification 
must enable one skilled in the art to ‘use’ 
the invention whereas § 102 makes no such requirement 
as to an anticipatory disclosure.”). 

[6][7][8] The confusion stems from the fact 
that where a method claim is at issue, it is a largely 
meaningless formulation of the standard to require 
a reference to disclose how to “make” that method 
in order to anticipate. For method claims, the 
“make” requirement becomes, in effect, a “use” requirement. 
The only way one can show that a reference 
enables the method is to show that a person of 
ordinary skill would know how to use-in other 
words, to practice or to carry out-the method in 
light of the reference. This does not mean, however, 
that the prior art reference must demonstrate the invention's 
utility. For instance, in the context of a 
claimed method for treating a disease, a prior art 
reference need not disclose “proof of efficacy” to 
anticipate the claim. Impax Labs., 545 F.3d at 1315; 
Rasmusson, 413 F.3d at 1326. Gleave's claims are 
*1336 to compositions of matter-oligonucleotides-
and therefore a reference satisfies the 
enablement requirement of § 102(b) by showing 
that one of skill in the art would know how to make 
the relevant sequences disclosed in Wraight. Thus, 
the fact that Wraight provides “no understanding of 
which of the targets would be useful” is of no import, 
because Gleave admits that it is well within 
the skill of an ordinary person in the art to make

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1331) 

any oligodeoxynucleotide sequence. See Appellant's 
Br. 10. As such, Wraight is an enabling disclosure 
sufficient to anticipate Gleave's invention 
under § 102(b). 

[9] Gleave also points out that “[n]o example 
of an actual antisense oligonucleotide complementary 
to a sequence on [Wraight's] list is shown to 
have antisense activity.” Id. at 4. We need not address 
any inherency issues, however, because the 
simple fact is that Gleave's composition claims do 
not require antisense activity either. The claims at 
issue merely require the oligodeoxynucleotides to 
be “of sufficient length to act as an antisense inhibitor 
of human IGFBP-2 and human IGFBP-5.” See 
Oral Arg. at 1:18, available at http:// oralarguments. 
cafc. uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2008-1453. mp 3 
(Judge Prost: “I'm a little confused by this, and I 
guess turning to the language in claim 1, doesn't it 
just disclose an oligo ‘of sufficient length to act as 
an antisense inhibitor?’ And I'm not seeing where 
the language requires that the oligo actually acts as 
an antisense inhibitor.” Gleave's counsel: “No, it 
doesn't.”). As explained above, evidence as to 
whether particular compounds work for their intended 
purpose is irrelevant to our § 102(b) analysis. 
Certainly where the claims themselves do not require 
a particular activity, we have no call to require 
something more from the anticipating reference. 
B 

[10] At its core, Gleave's primary argument is 
rooted in policy: 
Where the allegedly anticipatory disclosure is 
only a small part of a much larger and exhaustive 
listing and there is no basis in the art for selecting 
some individual members of the listing over others, 
what is actually described and what is actually 
disclosed to the public is no more than the 
generic concept underlying the list. 

Appellant's Br. 6. In other words, Gleave argues 
that we should collapse the distinction 
between a list and a genus disclosure. See Oral Arg. 

at 4:42, available at http:// oralarguments. cafc. 
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2008-1453. mp 3 (Judge 
Moore: “I understand what you're saying-from a 
policy perspective, you'd like us to say when a list 
gets long enough, you ought to treat them the 
same.” Gleave's counsel: “No, I'm not even saying 
when a list gets long enough. I'm saying when a list 
provides no more information to an inve-to the public 
than the generic statement would.”) If we did, 
the argument goes, then we would recognize that 
Wraight simply provides a “long winded form of a 
statement that ‘you could make antisense that targets 
IGFBP-2.’ ” 

Gleave also cites In re Wiggins for the proposition 
that a list of compounds, “without any direction 
as to selection among the targets, is not a description 
of any one of these targets.” Gleave urges 
us to find that Wiggins “clearly expressed the 
policy concerns which this case exemplifies, that 
giving prior art effect to individual members of lists 
of thousands of theoretically possible compounds 
would be contrary to the purpose sought to be effectuated 
by the patent law.” Reply Br. 7-8 (citing 

In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543 (CCPA 1973) 

(quotations omitted)). 

In Wiggins, the Court of Customs and Patent 
Appeals stated: 

*1337 In our view, [the alleged anticipatory reference's] 
listing of the compounds by name constituted 
nothing more than speculation about their 
potential or theoretical existence. The mere naming 
of a compound in a reference, without more, 
cannot constitute a description of the compound, 

particularly when, as in this case, the evidence of 
record suggests that a method suitable for its 
preparation was not developed until a date later 
than that of the reference. 

If we were to hold otherwise, lists of thousands 
of theoretically possible compounds could be 
generated and published which, assuming it 
would be within the level of skill in the art to 
make them, would bar a patent to the actual dis

coverer of a named compound no matter how beneficial 
to mankind it might be. 

488 F.2d at 543 (emphases added). 

[11] Gleave reads Wiggins to suggest that a description 
of a compound cannot be anticipatory 
where it appears in a long list of other compounds. 
That conclusion, however, ignores the facts at issue 
in that case. Contrary to Gleave's representations, 
no evidence existed that a person of ordinary skill 
in the art could make the compounds disclosed in 
the alleged anticipatory reference at the time of disclosure. 
The reference, published in 1957, mentioned 
by name two compounds that fell within the 
scope of Wiggins's claims. But the reference also 
noted that the synthesis of these compounds had 
been unsuccessful; further, the only publication of 
record that disclosed a method of making the compounds 
was not published until two years later. In 
short, the reference was not an enabling reference-
no person of ordinary skill in the art could make the 
FN3

claimed invention in 1957.

FN3. It is true that “[e]nablement of an anticipatory 
reference may be demonstrated 
by a later reference.” Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, 246 F.3d at 1379. But in Wiggins, 
our predecessor court did not elect to decide 
the case on this ground. 488 F.2d at 
543 n. 4 (“We do not mean to suggest that 
we have actually evaluated the process 
taught by [the later reference] and concluded 
that it could be used to prepare the 
claimed compounds. As this is irrelevant to 
our decision, we express no opinion on this 
point.”). 

[12] The Wiggins court stated that “[t]he mere 
naming of a compound in a reference, without 
more, cannot constitute a description of the compound.” 
488 F.2d at 543. We agree. The mere naming 
of a theoretical compound, without more, cannot 
constitute a description under § 102(b). 
“Without more” is the key phrase, and read as a 
whole Wiggins makes clear just what this 
something “more” is-a person of ordinary skill in 
the art's ability to make the claimed compound. See 
also Donohue, 766 F.2d at 533-34; In re Samour, 
571 F.2d 559, 562-64 (CCPA 1978); In re Brown, 
51 C.C.P.A. 1254, 329 F.2d 1006, 1009-10 (1964) 
(discussing In re Von Bramer, 29 C.C.P.A. 1018, 
127 F.2d 149 (1942)). This point is underscored by 
the excerpt: not once, not twice, but three times the 
court pointed out that its discussion was in the context 
of “potential or theoretical” compounds. That 
was the issue presented to the court, and that was 
the issue it decided. 

[13] For the purposes of whether they are anticipatory, 
lists and genera are often treated differently 
under our case law. Compare Perricone v. 
Medicis Pharm. Corp., 432 F.3d 1368, 1376 
(Fed.Cir.2005) (rejecting “the notion that [a compound] 
cannot anticipate because it appears without 
special emphasis in a longer list”) with Atofina v. 
Great Lakes Chem. Corp., 441 F.3d 991, 999 
(Fed.Cir.2006) (“It is well established that the disclosure 
of a genus in the prior art is not necessarily 
a disclosure of every species that is a member of 
that genus.”). This distinction collapses *1338 
when the class of compounds that falls within the 
genus is so limited that a person of ordinary skill in 
the art can “at once envisage each member of this 
limited class.” Eli Lilly, 471 F.3d at 1376. In that 
limited circumstance, a reference describing the 
genus anticipates every species within the genus. 
See Perricone, 432 F.3d at 1377. In this case, 
Gleave's arguments fail for two reasons. First, 
Wraight expressly lists every possible fifteen-
base-long oligodeoxynucleotide sequence in IGFBP-
2, and under our precedent, this list anticipates 
Gleave's claims. Second, even if we were to accept 
Gleave's invitation to treat Wraight as equivalent to 
the statement that one “could make antisense that 
FN4

targets IGFBP-2,” which we decline to do, a 
person of ordinary skill in the art equipped with an 
IGFBP sequence is admittedly capable of envisioning 
how to make any antisense sequence. Thus, 
even if we were to adopt Gleave's policy position, 
Gleave's claims would not be entitled to a patent

over Wraight. 

FN4. We note that this is not the full extent 
of Wraight's disclosure. See supra 

[14] The rest of Gleave's arguments fare no 
better. For instance, Gleave protests that Wraight 
“does not show that sequences antisense to any of 
the sequences in this list were actually made and 
tested.” As we have already made clear, it is not 
“necessary that an invention disclosed in a publication 
shall have actually been made in order to satisfy 
the enablement requirement.” Donohue, 766 
F.2d at 533. In light of the foregoing, we agree with 
the Board's conclusion that Gleave's claims are invalid 
as anticipated by Wraight. 
CONCLUSION 

In sum, “[t]he discovery of a new property or 
use of a previously known composition, even when 
that property and use are unobvious from the prior 
art, can not impart patentability to claims to the 
known composition.” In re Spada, 911 F.2d 705, 
708 (Fed.Cir.1990). The compositions described in 
the ' 493 application are simply not new-they were 
described in Wraight's enabling disclosure. As we 
explained in In re Schoenwald, Gleave's contribution, 
at best, is “finding a use for the compound, not 
discovering the compound itself.” 964 F.2d 1122, 
1124 (Fed.Cir.1992). If the use Gleave discovered 
is new, he will be able to patent that method of use“
any more would be a gratuity.” Id. Therefore, we 
affirm the Board's rejection of claims 1, 4, 15, and 
18-21 of the '493 application under § 102(b). We 
need not reach the § 103 obviousness rejection.

No. 2008-1352. 
March 20, 2009. 


Background: Pharmaceutical company and inventor 
brought action against Patent and Trademark 
Office (PTO) challenging newly-adopted 
rules that limited number of continuing applications, 
requests for continued examination (RCE), 
and claims that applicant could make. The United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, 
James C. Cacheris, Senior District Judge, 541 
F.Supp.2d 805, granted summary judgment for 
plaintiffs. PTO appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) provision that empowers the PTO to “establish 
regulations, not inconsistent with law,” to “govern 
the conduct of proceedings in the Office,” does not 
vest the PTO with any general substantive rulemaking 
power; 
(2) determination by PTO as to scope of its own authority 
under provision that gave it authority to 
“establish regulations, not inconsistent with law,” 
to “govern the conduct of proceedings in the Office,” 
was not entitled to Chevron deference; 
(3) final rules that limited number of continuing applications, 
RCE, and claims that applicant could 
make were procedural; 

(4) examination support document (ESD) rule, requiring 
patent applicants who presented more than 
five independent claims or 25 total claims to 
provide examiner with information about prior art 
and why they believed claims were patentable over 
it, was procedural; 
(5) rule requiring preexamination search of “U.S. 
patents and patent application publications, foreign 
patent documents, and non-patent literature,” and 
requesting specific details about scope of search, 
set forth facially reasonable procedural requirement; 
(6) rule that limited continuation applications on 
basis of total number of such applications previously 
filed, without regard to when application was 
filed, was invalid; 
(7) rule requiring applicant to file petition “showing 
that the amendment, argument, or evidence sought 
to be entered could not have been submitted prior to 
the close of prosecution in the application” was entitled 
to Chevron deference; and 
(8) ESD rule did not alter ultimate burdens of examiner 
or applicant during examination.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office 
(“USPTO”) appeals the April 1, 2008 decision of 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District 
of Virginia granting summary judgment that 
four recently promulgated rules exceed the scope of 
the USPTO's rulemaking authority. Because we 
conclude that the four rules are procedural, but that 
Rule 78 is inconsistent with 35 U.S.C. § 120, we affirm-
in-part, vacate-in-part, and remand. 

I. BACKGROUND 
In January 2006, the USPTO initiated two related 
notice and comment rulemaking proceedings. 
After receiving and considering the public comments, 
the USPTO issued the new rules on August 
21, 2007, with an effective date of November 1, 
2007. Changes to Practice for Continued Examination 
Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably 
Indistinct Claims, and Examination of 
Claims in Patent Applications, 72 Fed.Reg. 46,716 
(Aug. 21, 2007). Four of the new rules 

(collectively, the “Final Rules”) are at issue in this 
appeal. 

*1350 Two of the new rules, Final Rule 78 and 
Final Rule 114, pertain to continuation applications 
and requests for continued examination (“RCEs”) 
and were issued to address the “large and growing 
backlog of unexamined patent applications.” Id. at 
46,717. Final Rule 78 governs the availability of 
continuation and continuation-in-part applications.

FN1 

Under the rule, an applicant is entitled to file 
two continuation applications as a matter of right. 
37 C.F.R. § 1.78(d)(1)(i). If an applicant wishes to 
pursue more than two continuation applications, he 
must file a petition “showing that the amendment, 
argument, or evidence sought to be entered could 
not have been submitted during the prosecution of 
the prior-filed application.” Id. § 1.78(d)(1)(vi). If 
the applicant cannot make the requisite showing, 
the USPTO will accept the application for examination 
but will “refuse to enter, or will delete if 
present, any specific reference to a prior-filed application.” 
Id. § 1.78(d)(1). The effect of this is to 
remove the application from the scope of 35 U.S.C. 
§ 120, which would otherwise entitle the application 
to the filing date of the prior-filed application. 
Final Rule 114 provides for similar treatment of 
RCEs. Under the rule, an applicant is allowed one 
RCE as a matter of right. Id. § 1.114(f). For each 
additional RCE, the applicant must file a petition 
“showing that the amendment, argument, or evidence 
sought to be entered could not have been submitted 
prior to the close of prosecution in the application.” 
Id. § 1.114(g). The limitation on RCEs 
is applied on the basis of application families, 
rather than individual applications. Id. § 1.114(f). 

FN1. For a discussion of the problems created 
by continuation applications, see 
Mark A. Lemley & Kimberly A. Moore, 

Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations, 84 

B.U. L.Rev. 63, 71-83 (2004). 
The two other rules, Final Rule 75 and Final 
Rule 265, are intended to address the USPTO's difficulty 
in examining applications that contain a

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

large number of claims. 72 Fed.Reg. at 46,721. Final 
Rule 75 requires an applicant who submits 
either more than five independent claims or twenty-
five total claims to provide the examiner with information 
in an examination support document 
(“ESD”). 37 C.F.R. § 1.75(b)(1). The requirements 
for ESDs are set forth in Final Rule 265. To comply 
with Final Rule 265, an applicant must conduct a 
preexamination prior art search, provide a list of the 
most relevant references, identify which limitations 
are disclosed by each reference, explain how each 
independent claim is patentable over the references, 
and show where in the specification each limitation 
is disclosed in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 

1. Id. § 1.265(a). 
Shortly after the Final Rules were published in 
the Federal Register, Triantafyllos Tafas, SmithKline 
Beecham Corporation, and Glaxo Group Limited 
(collectively, “Appellees”) filed suit against the 
USPTO. On October 31, 2007, the district court 
preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Final 
Rules. Tafas v. Dudas, 511 F.Supp.2d 652 
(E.D.Va.2007) (“ Tafas I ”). Appellees then moved 
for summary judgment that the Final Rules are invalid 
and sought a permanent injunction against 
their enforcement. Appellees' summary judgment 
motions alleged that the Final Rules were impermissibly 
substantive, inconsistent with law, arbitrary 
and capricious, incomprehensibly vague, impermissibly 
retroactive, and procedurally defective. 

The district court agreed with Appellees that 
the Final Rules were “substantive rules that change 
existing law and alter *1351 the rights of applicants 
such as [Appellees] under the Patent Act.” Tafas v. 
Dudas, 541 F.Supp.2d 805, 814 (E.D.Va.2008) (“ 
Tafas II ”). Specifically, the district court found 
that the Final Rules created limits on continuation 
applications, RCEs, and claims that were inconsistent 
with several sections of the Patent Act, as well 
as precedent from this court and its predecessor, the 
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The district 
court concluded that because the USPTO lacks substantive 
rulemaking authority under Merck & Co., 

Inc. v. Kessler, 80 F.3d 1543, 1550 (Fed.Cir.1996), 
the Final Rules exceed the USPTO's statutory jurisdiction 
in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Tafas II, 
541 F.Supp.2d at 814. Accordingly, the district 
court granted Appellees' motion for summary judg


FN2

ment that the Final Rules are invalid.

FN2. The district court fully disposed of 
the case on the grounds that the Final 
Rules are substantive. As part of its analysis, 
the court partially considered whether 
the rules conflict with the law. Apart from 
this, the court did not address Appellees' 
other arguments. 

The USPTO timely appealed. We have jurisdiction 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 

II. DISCUSSION 
“We review the district court's grant of summary 
judgment without deference, reapplying the 
same standard as the district court.” Star Fruits 

S.N.C. v. United States, 393 F.3d 1277, 1281 
(Fed.Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate 
only if the record shows “there is no genuine issue 
as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 
56(c); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 
U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 
(1986). Under the Administrative Procedure Act 
(“APA”), the reviewing court shall set aside agency 
action if it is found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an 
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance 
with law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, 
privilege, or immunity,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, 
authority, or limitations, or short of statutory 
right,” or “without observance of procedure 
required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). 
The USPTO alleges two main errors in the district 
court's analysis. First, the USPTO argues that 
the court erred by failing to give the agency's interpretation 
of 35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2)'s grant of rulemaking 
authority proper deference under Chevron 
U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 
Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 5 

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

(1984). The USPTO contends that under a proper 
application of Chevron, the inquiry in this case is 
not whether the rules are substantive or procedural, 
but whether they fit within a reasonable interpretation 
of § 2(b)(2), which gives the USPTO authority 
to “establish regulations, not inconsistent with law, 
which ... shall govern the conduct of proceedings in 
the Office ... [and] facilitate and expedite the processing 
of patent applications.” 35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2). 
Second, the USPTO argues that even if the substantive/
procedural framework is applicable, the Final 
Rules are clearly procedural. According to the 
USPTO, the district court's erroneous conclusion 
that the Final Rules are substantive was the result 
of a mistaken interpretation of the rules, misapplication 
of the statutes and precedent, and failure to 
properly give deference to the USPTO's interpretation 
of the Patent Act under Chevron and National 
Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet 
Services, 545 U.S. 967, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 
L.Ed.2d 820 (2005). We address each argument in 
turn. 

A. The Scope of the USPTO's Rulemaking Authority 
Section 2(b)(2) of the Patent Act gives the 
USPTO authority to 

*1352 establish regulations, not inconsistent with 
law, which ... (A) shall govern the conduct of 
proceedings in the office; ... (C) shall facilitate 
and expedite the processing of patent applications, 
particularly those which can be filed, 
stored, processed, searched, and retrieved electronically 
... (D) may govern the recognition and 
conduct of agents, attorneys, or other persons 
representing applicants or other parties before the 
Office.... 

35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2). Additionally, 35 U.S.C. § 
132(b) requires the USPTO to “prescribe regulations 
to provide for the continued examination of 
applications for patent at the request of the applicant.” 
The USPTO asserts that this case should be 
fully resolved in its favor based on the language of 
these two sections. So long as the Final Rules fall 

within the scope of either § 2(b)(2) or § 132(b), the 
USPTO contends, they do not exceed its rulemaking 
authority. Further, the USPTO argues that this 
court has previously recognized that the USPTO's 
interpretation of its rulemaking authority under § 
2(b)(2) is entitled to Chevron deference. See, e.g., 
Lacavera v. Dudas, 441 F.3d 1380, 1383 
(Fed.Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1205, 127 
S.Ct. 1246, 167 L.Ed.2d 74 (2007). The USPTO 
thus argues that the district court erred by grafting a 
distinction between substantive and procedural 
rules onto the plain language of § 2(b)(2) without 
according any deference to the USPTO's interpretation. 
Appellees maintain that the district court correctly 
decided that the USPTO cannot make substantive 
rules and no deference is due until it is established 
that the USPTO has acted within its statutory 
authority. We begin by addressing whether 
the USPTO's authority is subject to the substantive/ 
procedural distinction, and then examine the proper 
level of deference to be given in this case. 

1. The Substantive/Procedural Distinction 
We agree with the district court that § 2(b)(2) 
“does not vest the USPTO with any general substantive 
rulemaking power.” Tafas II, 541 
F.Supp.2d at 811. This principle is amply supported 
by our precedent. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund 

v. Quigg, 932 F.2d 920, 930 (Fed.Cir.1991) (“A 
substantive declaration with regard to the Commissioner's 
interpretation of the patent statutes, whether 
it be section 101, 102, 103, 112 or other section, 
does not fall within the usual interpretation of [the 
language in section 6, the predecessor of § 2(b)(2) 
].”); Merck, 80 F.3d at 1550 (Section 6 “does NOT 
grant the Commissioner the authority to issue substantive 
rules. Because Congress has not vested the 
Commissioner with any general substantive rule-
making power, the Final Determination at issue in 
this case cannot possibly have the force and effect 
of law.” (citations and quotation marks omitted)); 
Cooper Techs. Co. v. Dudas, 536 F.3d 1330, 1335 
(Fed.Cir.2008) (“To comply with section 
2(b)(2)(A), a Patent Office rule must be 
‘procedural’-i.e., it must ‘govern the conduct of

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

proceedings in the Office.’ ”). 

Additionally, when Merck was decided, 35 

U.S.C. § 6(a) gave the USPTO authority to establish 
regulations that govern “the conduct of proceedings.” 
We agree with Appellees that Congress's 
decision to replace § 6(a) with the current § 2(b)(2), 
which contains the same grant of authority to regulate 
“the conduct of proceedings in the Office” is 
indicative that Congress did not intend to give the 
FN3

USPTO substantive rulemaking authority. See 
*1353Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 
S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (“Congress is presumed 
to be aware of an administrative or judicial 
interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation 
when it re-enacts a statute without 
change.”). 

FN3. While Cooper Technologies, 536 
F.3d at 1336-37, casts doubt on the district 
court's view that § 2(b)(2)(B) requires notice 
and comment rulemaking for all 
USPTO rules, we nevertheless agree that 
Congress did not hide the “elephant” of 
substantive rulemaking authority in the 
“mousehole” of § 2(b)(2)(B). See Tafas II, 
541 F.Supp.2d at 812; see also Whitman v. 
Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468, 
121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). 

Accordingly, we must reject the USPTO's argument 
that the substantive/procedural distinction is 
immaterial in this case. 

2. Chevron Deference 
The USPTO argues that the district court erred 
by failing to accord Chevron deference at two 
stages of its analysis. First, Chevron deference is 
allegedly required for the threshold question of 
whether § 2(b)(2) vests the USPTO with substantive 
rulemaking authority. Second, the USPTO 
maintains that its interpretation of various sections 
of the Patent Act, and its accordant belief that the 
Final Rules are consistent therewith, is also entitled 
to deference. We cannot accept the USPTO's first 
argument, but we conclude that the USPTO's inter


pretations of statutes that pertain to the USPTO's 
delegated authority are entitled to Chevron deference. 


Before a reviewing court grants Chevron deference, 
it must first determine whether the agency's 
interpretation of the statute was made pursuant to 
“a congressional delegation of administrative authority.” 
Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 
649, 110 S.Ct. 1384, 108 L.Ed.2d 585 (1990). This 
threshold inquiry, which has been dubbed Chevron 
“step zero,” determines “whether courts should turn 
to the Chevron framework at all.” Thomas W. Merrill 
& Kristin E. Hickman, Chevron's Domain, 89 
Geo. L.J. 833, 836 (2001). Cases from this court 
have concluded, in different circumstances, that an 
agency's determination of the scope of its own authority 
is not entitled to Chevron deference. See, 
e.g., Borlem S.A.-Empreedimentos Industriais v. 
United States, 913 F.2d 933, 937 (Fed.Cir.1990) 
(“A court is indeed obligated to give deference to 
an agency acting within its scope of responsibility.... 
[However,] such deference should not apply 
when the issue is the legal scope of an agency's authority.”). 
A majority of the Supreme Court has not 
yet spoken to this issue. Cf. Miss. Power & Light 
Co. v. Miss. ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 380, 108 
S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) 
(“Contrary to the dissent, we have held 
that this rule of deference applies to an agency's interpretation 
of a statute designed to confine its authority.” 
(citation omitted)) with id. at 386, 108 
S.Ct. 2428 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“I cannot, 
however, agree with Justice SCALIA's conclusion 
that courts must defer to an agency's statutory construction 
even where, as here, the statute is designed 
to confine the scope of the agency's jurisdiction 
to the areas Congress intended it to occupy.”); 
see also N. Ill. Steel Supply Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 
294 F.3d 844, 846-47 (7th Cir.2002) (recognizing 
Justice Scalia's concurrence in Mississippi Power, 
stating that “the Supreme Court has not definitively 
ruled on the issue,” and declining to grant deference 
to the agency's determination of its own jurisdiction).

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

We are not persuaded by the USPTO's arguments 
in this case that Chevron deference should be 
extended to the issue of whether § 2(b)(2) provides 
substantive rulemaking authority. To the extent the 
USPTO relies on Federal Circuit cases that give 
Chevron deference to the USPTO's*1354 interpretation 
of certain phrases present in § 2(b)(2), we 
conclude that those cases are inapposite because 
they involve judicial review of rules that are procedural, 
and thus within the judicially interpreted 
scope of the USPTO's rulemaking authority. See, 
e.g., Bender v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368 
(Fed.Cir.2007) (deferring to the USPTO's interpretation 
of the phrase “before the Office” on review of 
the USPTO's decision to discipline an attorney for 
misconduct); Lacavera, 441 F.3d at 1383 (deferring 
to the USPTO's interpretation of “necessary qualifications” 
to be required of individuals who seek recognition 
to practice before the USPTO); Stevens v. 
Tamai, 366 F.3d 1325, 1333-34 (Fed.Cir.2004) (“In 
view of the reasonableness of the Office's rules 
governing the procedure in patent interferences, 
and the substantial deference we accord such rules 
....” (emphasis added)). Because we decline to accord 
deference with respect to the question of 
whether the USPTO has substantive rulemaking authority, 
our conclusion above that the USPTO does 
not have such authority is unaffected by Chevron. 

The next question is the level of deference to 
be given to USPTO rules that are within the scope 
of the USPTO's delegated authority, i.e., procedural 
rules promulgated under § 2(b)(2) or § 132(b). Our 
precedent is clear that the Chevron framework is 
applicable to review of these rules. See, e.g., 
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337; Bender, 490 F.3d 
at 1368; Lacavera, 441 F.3d at 1383; Stevens, 366 
F.3d at 1333; Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 
1422, 1425 (Fed.Cir.1988). Thus, on review of a 
procedural rule that has been issued by the USPTO, 
we will give Chevron deference to the USPTO's interpretation 
of statutory provisions that relate to the 
exercise of delegated authority. See Cooper Techs., 
536 F.3d at 1337 (“Because the Patent Office is 
specifically charged with administering statutory 

provisions relating to ‘the conduct of proceedings 
in the Office,’ 35 U.S.C. § 2(a)(2)(A), we give 
Chevron deference to its interpretations of those 
provisions.”). 

B. Classification of the Final Rules 
With the analytical framework established, we 
turn to whether the Final Rules are substantive or 
procedural. The parties agree that the USPTO has 
authority under § 2(b)(2) to promulgate procedural 
rules. They vigorously disagree, however, as to 
how the boundary between “substantive” and 
“procedural” rules should be defined. 

The district court relied on Chrysler Corp. v. 
Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 
L.Ed.2d 208 (1979), to define as substantive “any 
rule that ‘affect[s] individual rights and obligations.’ 
” Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 814. We do not 
read Chrysler to create such a broad and absolute 
rule. In the portion of Chrysler cited by the district 
court, the Court simply “noted a characteristic inherent 
in the concept of a ‘substantive rule’ ” and 
identified “an important touchstone for distinguishing 
those rules that may be ‘binding’ or have the 
‘force of law.’ ” 441 U.S. at 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705. 
Substantive rules certainly “affect individual rights 
and obligations,” but that inquiry does not necessarily 
distinguish most procedural requirements, which 
will also “affect individual rights and obligations.” 
The Supreme Court itself made this observation 
when drawing the line between “substance” and 
“procedure” in the context of the Rules Enabling 
Act. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 464-65, 
85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965) (“Undoubtedly 
most alterations of the rules of practice and procedure 
may and often do affect the rights of litigants.”). 
This court's predecessor made the same observation. 
See In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 945 
(CCPA 1982) (“True, the *1355 rule is substantive 
in that it relates to a condition under which a patent 
will be granted which otherwise would have to be 
denied for double patenting. Much of the content of 
the PTO rules is ‘substantive’ in this respect.”).

rules in terms of whether they “affect individual 
rights and obligations,” it has done so in the process 
of distinguishing between “interpretive” and 
“substantive” rules. See Animal Legal Def. Fund, 
932 F.2d at 927; Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336. 

We agree, therefore, with the USPTO that while the 
inquiry set forth in Chrysler and used in Animal 
Legal Defense Fund and Cooper Technologies may 
be useful in defining the boundary between interpretive 
and substantive rules, it is not dispositive on 
the issue of whether the Final Rules are procedural. 

In addition to Chrysler, the parties cite several 
cases from the D.C. Circuit that have addressed the 

FN4

boundaries of substantive rules.In American 
Hospital Ass'n v. Bowen, the D.C. Circuit defined 
substantive rules, as contrasted with interpretive 
rules, as those which “grant rights, impose obligations, 
or produce other significant effects on private 
interests, or which effect a change in existing law 
or policy.” 834 F.2d 1037, 1045 (D.C.Cir.1987) 
(citations and quotation marks omitted). With respect 
to the distinction between procedural and substantive 
rules, Bowen suggested that substantive 
rules “encode[ ] a substantive value judgment or 
put[ ] a stamp of approval or disapproval on a given 
type of behavior.” Id. at 1047. However, the D.C. 
Circuit has also noted that, “[o]f course, procedure 
impacts on outcomes and thus can virtually always 
be described as affecting substance.” JEM Broad. 
Co. v. FCC, 22 F.3d 320, 326 (D.C.Cir.1994) 
(quoting Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. Dep't of 
Transp., 900 F.2d 369, 383 (D.C.Cir.1990) 

(Silberman, J., dissenting)). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit 
held in Public Citizen v. Department of State 
that although the State Department's decision not to 
search documents produced after the date of a Freedom 
of Information Act request represented a 
“judgment about procedural efficiency,” such a 
judgment does not “convert a procedural rule into a 
substantive one.” 276 F.3d 634, 641 (D.C.Cir.2002) 
(quotation marks omitted). Thus, the D.C. Circuit 
has considered many of the issues underlying the 
present case and has understandably hesitated to adopt 
a conclusive test for when rules cross the line 

between procedure and substance. 

FN4. The concurrence and dissent each 
correctly point out that this is not a case 
arising under the notice and comment rule-
making provision of the APA. Therefore, 
this case does not turn on whether the rules 
are “procedural” within the meaning of 5 

U.S.C. § 553(b)(A). We recognize that the 
definitions of “substance” and “procedure” 
in the notice and comment rulemaking 
context may embody policy considerations 
that are not coextensive with the considerations 
at issue in this case. However, we 
find that these cases are nevertheless helpful 
to the task of drawing a similar line 
between “substance” and “procedure” in 
the present case. 
We are most persuaded in this case by the D.C. 
Circuit's approach in JEM. At issue in that case 
were “hard look” rules adopted by the Federal 
Communications Commission (“FCC”) in response 
to a significant number of “carelessly prepared and 
speculative applications” for broadcasting licenses. 
22 F.3d at 327. Under those rules, applications that 
either failed to include necessary information or 
contained incorrect or inconsistent information that 
could not be “resolved within the confines of the 
application and with a high degree of confidence” 
were dismissed with no opportunity to cure the defect. 
Id. at 322. The D.C. Circuit rejected JEM's 
contention that the rules were substantive *1356 because 
they “deprive[d] license applicants of the opportunity 
to correct errors or defects in their filings.” 
Id. at 327. In doing so, the court noted that a 
“critical feature of the procedural exception [in section 
553 of the APA] is that it covers agency actions 
that do not themselves alter the rights or interests 
of parties, although [they] may alter the 
manner in which the parties present themselves or 
their viewpoints to the agency.” Id. at 326 
(emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). The 
“critical fact” that was “fatal to JEM's claim,” the 
court held, was that the “hard look” rules “did not

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

change the substantive standards by which the FCC 
evaluates license applications.” Id. at 327. The 
court recognized that the rules could result in the 
loss of substantive rights, but found that they were 
nonetheless procedural because they did not 
“foreclose effective opportunity to make one's case 
on the merits.” Id. at 327-28 (quoting Lamoille Valley 
R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 711 
F.2d 295, 328 (D.C.Cir.1983)). 

While we do not purport to set forth a definitive 
rule for distinguishing between substance and 
procedure in this case, we conclude that the Final 
Rules challenged in this case are procedural. In essence, 
they govern the timing of and materials that 
must be submitted with patent applications. The Final 
Rules may “alter the manner in which the 
parties present ... their viewpoints” to the USPTO, 
but they do not, on their face, “foreclose effective 
opportunity” to present patent applications for examination. 
JEM, 22 F.3d at 326, 328. 

Final Rules 78 and 114 provide requirements 
for when continuation applications will be accepted 
and RCEs will be granted. The D.C. Circuit has recognized 
time schedules as being “definitely at the 
procedural end of a spectrum running from 
‘procedural’ to ‘substantive.’ ” Lamoille, 711 F.2d 
at 328. Applicants who include in each continuation 
application all amendments, arguments, and evidence 
available at the time of filing will not be limited 
by Final Rule 78. Similarly, applicants who diligently 
present all of their amendments, arguments, 
and evidence as soon as possible during prosecution 
will be granted as many RCEs as they require. 
Thus, applications that are submitted in compliance 
with these timing requirements will be fully examined 
and given all of the benefits provided by the 
Patent Act. See JEM, 22 F.3d at 327. We do not believe 
that requiring applicants to raise all then-
available amendments, arguments, and evidence by 
the second continuation application or the first RCE 
is so significant a burden that applicants will be effectively 
foreclosed from obtaining the patent rights 
to which they are entitled. See Lamoille, 711 F.2d 

at 328. 

We are of course aware that the impact of Final 
Rules 78 and 114 will be largely dependent on how 
the USPTO interprets when amendments, arguments, 
and evidence “could not have been submitted 
during the prosecution of the prior-filed application” 
or “prior to the close of prosecution.” 37 

C.F.R. §§ 1.78, 1.114(g). When the Final Rules 
were published, the USPTO also published responses 
to questions raised during the notice and 
comment proceedings, many of which addressed 
specific scenarios under which continuation applications 
and RCEs may be requested. See, e.g., 72 
Fed.Reg. at 46,769-77. The district court relied on 
the contents of these responses to conclude that the 
USPTO “intends to deny additional applications in 
almost all circumstances” such that Final Rules 78 
and 114 are in fact “hard limits” on continuation 
applications and RCEs. Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 
814-16. Appellees and several amici encourage us 
to adopt this analysis. However, we decline to rely 
on these responses, which are not binding on *1357 
the USPTO and often either state that decisions will 
be made on a “case-by-case basis” or speak in 
terms of whether it is “likely” or “unlikely” that a 
petition will be granted, to justify a decision that 
the Final Rules, as actually codified in the Code of 
Federal Regulations, are facially invalid. These responses 
are not binding on the courts, which will be 
free to entertain challenges to the USPTO's application 
of the Final Rules, including its view of when 
amendments, arguments, and evidence could not 
have been submitted earlier, under the standard set 
forth in 5 U.S.C. § 706. 
With respect to the ESD requirement, Final 
Rules 75 and 265 require applicants who present 
more than five independent claims or twenty-five 
total claims to provide the examiner with information 
about the prior art and why they believe the 
claims are patentable over it. Once a satisfactory 
ESD is submitted, examination will proceed in precisely 
the same manner as it would have in the absence 
of the rule. It is important to note that an ex

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

aminer is not permitted to substantively reject 
claims on grounds that the ESD did not prove that 
the claims are patentable. While an examiner is of 
course free to base a rejection on references disclosed 
in the ESD, he must nevertheless set forth 
his own prima facie case of unpatentability. Thus, 
while the rule may put a burden of production on 
the applicant, the examiner maintains the burden of 
persuasion. 

This court has previously recognized the validity 
of two USPTO rules that place upon applicants 
the burden of submitting information in response to 
an examiner's request. See Star Fruits, 393 F.3d at 
1282-84 (Rule 105); see also In re Epstein, 32 F.3d 
1559, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1994) (Plager, J., concurring) ( 
Rule 56). Rather than arguing that Rules 56 and 
105 are invalid, Appellees attempt to distinguish 
them from the Final Rules because they only pertain 
to information that is already known by or 
readily available to the applicant. GlaxoSmithKline 
Br. 48. While we recognize this difference, we decline 
to draw the line between procedure and substance 
on these grounds alone. A procedural rule 
does not become substantive simply because it requires 
the applicant to exert more effort to comply, 
so long as the effort required is not so great that it 
effectively forecloses the possibility of compliance. 
See Lamoille, 711 F.2d at 328. 

Appellees and amici argue that the ESD requirement 
is in fact so draconian that compliance 
would be both impossible and extraordinarily foolish. 
With respect to impossibility, Appellees argue 
that Rule 265 requires a “world-wide search of prior 
art without regard to scope, time, or cost.” 
GlaxoSmithKline Br. 46. We do not find such a requirement 
on the face of Final Rule 265. Rather, the 
rule describes a preexamination search of “U.S. patents 
and patent application publications, foreign 
patent documents, and non-patent literature,” and 
requests specific details about the scope of the 
search. 37 C.F.R. § 1.265(a)-(b). The text of the 
rule does not demand that the applicant review 
every reference that fits into one of those categor


ies, regardless of its location or accessibility. Instead, 
it requires applicants to conduct and document 
a “search.” A “search” of “non-patent literature” 
does not necessarily require a visit to every 
library in every corner of the world. A reasonable, 
cost-effective search is just as much a “search” as 
the search described by Appellees. While the text of 
the rules sets forth a facially reasonable procedural 

FN5

requirement,we are mindful of the possibility 
*1358 that the USPTO may in some cases attempt 
to apply the rules in a way that makes compliance 
essentially impossible and substantively deprives 
applicants of their rights. In such cases, judicial review 
will be available under 5 U.S.C. § 706. 

FN5. To the extent the USPTO has commented 
about its intended application of 
the ESD requirement, either in public 
speeches or in the Federal Register, we 
make the same observation made above: 
these comments do not bind the USPTO 
with respect to its future actions, and they 
do not affect the courts' ability to resolve 
challenges to specific applications of the 
rules. 

Search scope aside, several amici argue that 
submitting an ESD is so wrought with peril that 
sane applicants will be absolutely limited to five independent 
claims and twenty-five total claims. 
These arguments have two components. The first is 
that even the most diligently prepared ESD will inevitably 
open the applicant to inequitable conduct 
allegations that will entail costly litigation and a 
possible finding of unenforceability. We believe 
this concern is too speculative to void the rules and, 
in any event, is at its core a matter of inequitable 
conduct doctrine, not USPTO rulemaking authority. 
The reach of inequitable conduct is solely within 
the control of the courts, and the doctrine has obviously 
not yet been applied in the context of an ESD. 
We decline to decide that an otherwise valid 
USPTO rule that requires applicants to provide information 
is void because this court might in the future 
apply inequitable conduct doctrine in such a

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

way that honest applicants who comply in good 
faith will nevertheless lose their patent rights. Under 
Kingsdown Medical Consultants, Ltd., v. Hollister, 
Inc., “ ‘gross negligence’ does not of itself 
justify an inference of intent to deceive.” 863 F.2d 
867, 876 (Fed.Cir.1988) (en banc in relevant part). 
We recognize that the drafting of an ESD will entail 
browsing many references, that mistakes and omissions 
will inevitably occur, and that the courts will 
be asked to determine if there was inequitable conduct. 
However, doubt about the judiciary's ability to 
apply its own doctrine in a way that yields fair results 
and discourages frivolous allegations should 
not preclude the USPTO from promulgating rules 
that are within its statutory authority. 

Second, several amici argue that ESDs will decrease 
the value of patent rights because the statements 
therein will limit claim scope through prosecution 
history estoppel. We do not believe applicants 
have a right to remain silent throughout prosecution 
in order to maximize their advantage in 
later litigation. The Patent Act demonstrates that 
applicants are expected to be forthright about their 
inventions. Section 112 requires applicants to 
provide a “written description of the invention, and 
of the manner and process of making and using it, 
in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to 
enable any person skilled in the art ... to make and 
use the same.” 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1 (emphasis added). 
It also requires the application to “conclude 
with one or more claims particularly pointing out 
and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the 
applicant regards as his invention.” Id. § 112, ¶ 2 
(emphasis added). This court has recognized that 
“[a]pplicants for patents have a duty to prosecute 
patent applications in the Patent Office with candor, 
good faith, and honesty.” See Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. 
Universal Avionics Sys. Corp., 488 F.3d 982, 999 
(Fed.Cir.2007). We are aware that some applicants 
attempt to say as little as possible during prosecution 
so that the precise boundaries of their claims 
will be open to argument as competitors' products 
enter the market and new prior art references are 
found during litigation. However, we consider this 

practice to be a burden on the patent system, not a 
right that can be invoked to void the Final Rules. 

*1359 Having concluded our discussion of why 
the Final Rules are procedural, it is important to 
note one way in which our substantive/procedural 
analysis differs from that of the district court. 
While the district court initially stated that it need 
not decide “whether the Final Rules run contrary to 
the Act's provisions,” it did just that throughout its 
discussion of the substantive nature of the rules. 
Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 811 n. 4, 814-17. The 
district court in large part based its conclusion that 
the Final Rules are substantive on grounds that they 
deprived applicants of rights guaranteed by various 
sections of the Patent Act. Id. at 814-17. Because, 
as discussed above, we do not believe the test the 
district court distilled from Chrysler-whether the 
rules “affect individual rights and obligations”-is 
correct, we similarly conclude that consistency with 
the Patent Act is not the touchstone of whether the 
rules are procedural or substantive. For example, 37 

C.F.R. § 1.52(a)(1)(i) requires most documents submitted 
to the USPTO to be printed on white paper. 
No one would dispute that this rule is procedural. If 
Congress then created a new section of the Patent 
Act that required all documents to be printed on 
yellow paper, § 1.52(a)(1)(i) would certainly become 
invalid. However, the reason for its invalidity 
would be that it is inconsistent with an express provision 
of the Act, not that the new statute transformed 
it from a procedural rule into a substantive 
one. Similarly, the USPTO's “determination” at issue 
in Merck was found to be substantive without 
regard to whether it conflicted with existing law. 
See 80 F.3d at 1550. Therefore, we find it necessary 
to separate the question of whether the Final Rules 
are procedural from the question of their consistency 
with the Patent Act. Having addressed the 
former, we now turn to the district court's view of 
the latter. 
C. Consistency with the Patent Act 
We address here the specific conflicts that the 
district court identified and relied upon in its opin

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

ion. Because each of the rules is procedural, we 
must, as discussed above, give Chevron deference 
to the USPTO's interpretation of the provisions of 
the Patent Act that relate to “proceedings in the Office.” 
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337. For such 
provisions, we must first determine “whether Congress 
has directly spoken to the precise question at 
issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the 
end of the matter; for the court, as well as the 
agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed 
intent of Congress.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 
842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. “[I]f the statute is silent or 
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the 
question for the court is whether the agency's answer 
is based on a permissible construction of the 
statute.” Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Even if a court 
has previously resolved the specific question at issue, 
the agency's construction must be adopted unless 
“the prior court decision holds that its construction 
follows from the unambiguous terms of 
the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.” 
Brand X, 545 U.S. at 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688. 

1. Final Rule 78 
The district court found that Final Rule 78's requirement 
for the third and subsequent continuation 
applications was inconsistent with the text of 35 

U.S.C. § 120 and this court's precedent. Section 120 
, with emphasis and bracketed enumeration added, 
provides that: 
An application for patent for [1] an invention disclosed 
in the manner provided by the first paragraph 
of section 112 of this title in an application 
previously filed in the United States, or as 
provided by section 363 of this title, which is [2] 
*1360 filed by an inventor or inventors named in 
the previously filed application shall have the 
same effect, as to such invention, as though filed 
on the date of the prior application, [3] if filed 
before the patenting or abandonment of or termination 
of proceedings on [3a] the first application 
or on [3b] an application similarly entitled to 
the benefit of the filing date of the first application 
and [4] if it contains or is amended to con


tain a specific reference to the earlier filed application. 
No application shall be entitled to the benefit 
of an earlier filed application under this section 
unless an amendment containing the specific 
reference to the earlier filed application is submitted 
at such time during the pendency of the 
application as required by the Director. The Director 
may consider the failure to submit such an 
amendment within that time period as a waiver of 
any benefit under this section. The Director may 
establish procedures, including the payment of a 
surcharge, to accept an unintentionally delayed 
submission of an amendment under this section. 

The district court concluded that Final Rule 78 
was inconsistent with the statutory mandate that 
qualifying applications “shall have” the benefit of 
the priority date of the initial application. Tafas II, 
541 F.Supp.2d at 814. Additionally, the district 
court cited this court's predecessor for the propositions 
that “there is no statutory basis for fixing an 
arbitrary limit to the number of [continuing] applications,” 
id. (quoting In re Henriksen, 55 C.C.P.A. 
1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254 (1968)) (alteration 
provided by the district court), and that “a limit 
upon continuing applications is a matter of policy 
for the Congress,” id. (quoting In re Hogan, 559 
F.2d 595, 604 n. 13 (CCPA 1977)). In light of the 
USPTO's presumed “inten[t] to deny additional applications 
in almost all circumstances,” the district 
court found that Final Rule 78 set forth a 
“mechanical rule” that “changes existing law and 
deprives applicants of their valuable rights under 35 

U.S.C. § 120 to an unlimited number of continuation 
and continuation-in-part applications as a 
matter of right.” Id. at 815. 
We agree with the district court that Final Rule 
78 is inconsistent with § 120, although we rely on 
narrower grounds. Section 120 unambiguously 
states that an application that meets four requirements 
“shall have the same effect, as to such invention, 
as though filed on the date of the prior application.” 
35 U.S.C. § 120 (emphasis added). These 
requirements, which correspond to the bracketed

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

enumeration above, include [1] the invention 
claimed in the application must have been properly 
disclosed in a prior-filed application; [2] the application 
must have been filed by inventor(s) named on 
the prior-filed application; [3] the application must 
have been “filed before the patenting or abandonment 
of or termination of proceedings on the first 
application or on an application similarly entitled to 
the benefit of the filing date of the first application”; 
and [4] the application must contain or be 
amended to contain a specific reference to the prior-
filed application. The use of “shall” indicates 
that these are the exclusive requirements, and that 
all applications that meet these requirements must 
receive the benefit provided by § 120. See Transco 
Prods., Inc. v. Performance Contracting, Inc., 38 
F.3d 551, 556 (Fed.Cir.1994) (“The plain and unambiguous 
meaning of section 120 is that any application 
fulfilling the requirements therein ‘shall 
have the same effect’ as if filed on the date of the 
application upon which it claims priority.”). Thus, 
Rule 78 is invalid because it attempts to add an additional 
requirement-that the application not contain 
amendments, arguments, or evidence that could 
have been submitted earlier-that is foreclosed by 
the statute. Because the statute is clear and unambiguous 
with respect to *1361 this issue, the 
USPTO's reliance on Chevron and Brand X is unavailing. 


As amici, several intellectual property and administrative 
law professors argue that Henriksen 
expressly recognized ambiguity in § 120. Accordingly, 
they argue, the USPTO's interpretation is entitled 
to deference under Brand X. We agree that 
the Henriksen court's approach of delving into the 
legislative history, which it noted was “somewhat 
inconclusive,” indicates that the text of the statute 
contains some ambiguity. See Henriksen, 399 F.2d 
at 256-58. However, the issue in Henriksen was 
whether there was a “limit to the number of prior 
applications through which a chain of copendency 
may be traced to obtain the benefit of the filing date 
of the earliest of a chain of copending applications.” 
Id. at 254. In other words, the question re


lated to the permissible length of a chain of serial 
continuation applications, not the total number of 
continuation applications that may be filed. Specifically, 
the dispute was over the meaning of 
clause [3b] identified above-“an application similarly 
entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the 
first application.” Id. at 260-61. The ambiguity in 
clause [3b], however, cannot save Final Rule 78. 
The Final Rule limits continuation applications on 
the basis of the total number of such applications 
previously filed, not on the length of a given serial 
chain of such applications. 37 C.F.R. § 
1.78(d)(1)(i)(B). By its terms, Final Rule 78 would 
apply to an applicant who seeks to file three continuation 
applications while the first application is 
still pending, even though each of these applications 
falls squarely within clause [3a] and would 
thus satisfy any reasonable interpretation of clause 

[3] and the rest of § 120. Therefore, while we must 
defer to the USPTO's reasonable interpretation of 
clause [3], there is no such interpretation that preserves 
the validity of Final Rule 78. 
Finally, the USPTO's reliance on In re Bogese, 
303 F.3d 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002), is unavailing. In 
Bogese, this court affirmed the Board of Patent Appeals 
and Interferences's rejection of claims in the 
applicant's continuation application on the grounds 
of extraordinary delay in prosecution. 303 F.3d at 
1366. The applicant had submitted “twelve continuation 
applications over an eight-year period and did 
not substantively advance prosecution of [the application 
at issue] when required and given an opportunity 
to do so.” Id. at 1369. According to the 
USPTO, Bogese “forecloses any argument that the 
conditions enumerated in Section 120 for making a 
priority claim are exclusive.” USPTO Br. 45. This 
is so, it contends, because the opinion recognized 
that “[t]he PTO has inherent authority to govern 
procedure before the PTO, and that authority allows 
it to set reasonable deadlines and requirements for 
the prosecution of applications.” Bogese, 303 F.3d 
at 1368. We do not read the opinion so broadly. 
The holding of Bogese was that “the PTO has authority 
to order forfeiture of rights for unreasonable

delay.” Id. at 1369. However, Bogese does not extend 
that power beyond the boundaries of prosecution 
history laches, which was upheld as an equitable 
defense to infringement in Symbol Technologies, 
Inc. v. Lemelson Medical, 277 F.3d 1361 
(Fed.Cir.2002) (“ Symbol II ”). Rather, the panel recognized 
that “the PTO has the authority to reject 
patent applications for patents that would be unenforceable 
under our holding in [ Symbol II].” 
Bogese, 303 F.3d at 1367. We agree that the 
USPTO has “inherent authority to govern procedure 
before the PTO, and that authority allows it to set 
reasonable deadlines and requirements for the prosecution 
of applications.” Id. at 1368. However, under 
Bogese, the USPTO cannot set requirements 
that conflict with § 120 unless those requirements 
comport with a proper application*1362 of prosecution 
history laches. There are no “firm guidelines” 
for determining when prosecution laches exists. 

Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Lemelson Med. Educ. & Research 
Found., 422 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed.Cir.2005) 
(“ Symbol IV ”). However, it is limited to cases of 
“unreasonable and unexplained delay in prosecution.” 
Id. at 1384-85. We need not address the precise 
boundaries of the USPTO's authority to promulgate 
rules under Bogese because Final Rule 78 
is far too restrictive to fall within the scope of prosecution 
history laches. The rule operates on an applicant's 
third continuation application without regard 
to when it was filed, even if the delay is significantly 
shorter than any of the delays in our prior 
prosecution history laches cases. See, e.g., Symbol 
IV, 422 F.3d at 1386 (eighteen to thirty-nine years 
elapsed between filing and issuance); Bogese, 303 
F.3d at 1369 (eight years without the applicant substantively 
advancing prosecution). The rule simply 
captures too many applications that would not be 
even remotely susceptible to a prosecution history 
laches challenge. Therefore, Final Rule 78 is not a 
proper use of the USPTO's authority under Bogese 
to apply prosecution history laches. 

2. Final Rule 114 
The district court found that Final Rule 114, 
which governs the availability of RCEs, conflicts 

with the Patent Act in two ways. The first was that 
it “places a limit on RCEs as of right on the basis of 
application family, rather than on the basis of each 
individual application, whether it be a parent application 
or a continuation or continuation-in-part 
application.” Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 815. The 
district court found that this was inconsistent with 
35 U.S.C. § 132, which uses the singular form of 
“application.” Additionally, the court noted Congress's 
“pronouncement, upon enacting Section 
132(b), that the RCE provisions ‘shall apply to all 
applications' filed on or after June 8, 1995.” Id. 
(quoting American Inventors Protection Act of 
1999, Pub.L. No. 106-113, § 4405(b)(1), 113 Stat. 
1501, 1501A-560 to 1501A-561 (1999)). Second, 
the court found that § 132(b)'s mandate that “[t]he 
director shall prescribe regulations to provide for 
the continued examination of applications for patent 
at the request of the applicant” gave applicants 
the right to “an unlimited number of RCEs per application 
at their discretion.” Id. This right, the 
court held, was violated by Final Rule 114. Id. 

We do not find that § 132 unambiguously dictates 
that its provisions be applied on a per application 
basis. Cf. Henriksen, 399 F.2d at 258 (“So 
read, ‘an application’ does not necessarily refer 
only to a single application.”); 1 U.S.C. § 1 
(“[W]ords importing the singular include and apply 
to several persons, parties, or things....”). Therefore, 
because we defer to the USPTO's reasonable 
interpretation of the statute, we conclude that Final 
Rule 114 can properly be applied on a per family 
basis. See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38. 

Appellees next argue that the use of “shall” in 
conjunction with the phrase “at the request of the 
applicant” in § 132(b) clearly shows that Congress 
intended RCEs to be unlimited and subject only to 
the applicant's discretion. GlaxoSmithKline Br. 40. 
We do not find the statute so clear. It is plausible 
that, as the USPTO suggests, § 132(b) simply directs 
the USPTO to “prescribe regulations” to govern 
the applicant's ability to request continued examination 
which must, in some circumstances, be

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

granted. Under this reading, nothing prevents the 
USPTO from limiting the availability of the second 
and subsequent RCEs. Because § 132(b) does not 
unambiguously require the USPTO to grant unlimited 
RCEs, we defer to the *1363 USPTO's interpretation. 
See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38. 

Finally, Appellees argue that § 132(a) requires 
the USPTO to continue examination if “the applicant 
persists in his claim for a patent.” Tafas Br. 
32-33. Section 132(a) provides: 

Whenever, on examination, any claim for a patent 
is rejected, or any objection or requirement 
made, the Director shall notify the applicant 
thereof, stating the reasons for such rejection, or 
objection or requirement, together with such information 
and references as may be useful in 
judging of the propriety of continuing the prosecution 
of his application; and if after receiving 
such notice, the applicant persists in his claim for 
a patent, with or without amendment, the application 
shall be reexamined. No amendment shall 
introduce new matter into the disclosure of the 
invention. 

35 U.S.C. § 132(a) (emphases added). The 
USPTO responds that this argument “reflects a misunderstanding 
of the relationship between subsections 
(a) and (b) [of § 132].” USPTO Br. 53. According 
to the USPTO, “[s]ubsection (a) provides 
for the ‘reexamination’ of an application at the applicant's 
request after the initial examination 
provided in section 131. In contrast, ‘continued examination’ 
under subsection (b) occurs after the 
reexamination provided for in subsection (a) is 
complete.” Id. Section 132 does not define the difference 
between “continued examination” and 
“reexamination.” Because we find the USPTO's explanation 
reasonable, we defer to its interpretation 
that § 132(a) does not require it to grant unlimited 
RCEs. See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38. 
Under this interpretation, Final Rule 114 does not 
conflict with § 132(a). 

3. Final Rules 75 and 265 
The district court held that the ESD requirement violated 
35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 103, 112, and 131, as well 
as this court's precedent that holds that applicants 
have no duty to search the prior art. The court 
began its analysis with § 112, ¶ 2's requirement that 
“[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more 
claims particularly pointing out and distinctly 
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards 
as his invention.” The district court held, and 
Appellees argue on appeal, that this language precludes 
the USPTO from putting an arbitrary limit 
on the number of claims in an application. 

Subject to the arguable requirement that an applicant 
cannot “obscure” his invention by “undue 
multiplicity,” our precedent does not suggest that 
there is a limit on the number of claims. In re 
Clark, 25 C.C.P.A. 1317, 97 F.2d 628, 631 (1938); 
see also In re Wakefield, 57 C.C.P.A. 959, 422 F.2d 
897, 900 (1970) (“[A]n applicant should be allowed 
to determine the necessary number and scope of his 
claims....”); In re Chandler, 50 C.C.P.A. 1422, 319 
F.2d 211, 225 (1963) (“[A]pplicants should be allowed 
reasonable latitude in stating their claims in 
regard to number and phraseology employed. The 
right of applicants to freedom of choice in selecting 
phraseology which truly points out and defines their 
inventions should not be abridged.”). However, we 
need not decide whether the USPTO may impose a 
limit on the number of claims an applicant can pursue 
because we do not find that the ESD requirement 
creates any such limit. Rather, it simply requires 
that an ESD be submitted if more than five 
independent or twenty-five total claims are included 
in certain sets of copending applications. 
Because we cannot, as discussed above, conclude 
that Final Rules 75 and 265, on their face, effectively 
foreclose applicants from successfully submitting 
ESDs, we similarly cannot conclude that these 
rules place an absolute *1364 limit on claim numbers 
in violation of § 112, ¶ 2. 

The district court also found that Final Rules 
75 and 265 went too far by requiring applicants to 
“conduct a broad search of patents, patent applica

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

tions, and literature, and provide, among other 
things, a ‘detailed explanation’ of ‘how each of the 
independent claims is patentable over the cited references.’ 
” Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 816 (quoting 
37 C.F.R. § 1.265(a)). The court relied on several 
of this court's inequitable conduct cases that noted 
that, in general, there is “no duty to conduct a prior 
art search.” Frazier v. Roessel Cine Photo Tech., 
Inc., 417 F.3d 1230, 1238 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting 
FMC Corp. v. Hennessy Indus., Inc., 836 F.2d 521, 
526 n. 6 (Fed.Cir.1987)); see also Bruno Indep. 
Living Aids, Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs., Ltd., 394 
F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 4 (Fed.Cir.2005). We agree with 
the USPTO that these cases do not speak to whether 
the USPTO may impose such a duty by regulation. 
Indeed, this court has already upheld the USPTO's 
authority to require from applicants “such information 
as may be reasonably necessary to properly examine 
or treat the matter.” 37 C.F.R. § 1.105; see 
also Star Fruits, 393 F.3d at 1282-84. On this record, 
we see no persuasive reason to prohibit the 
USPTO from requesting the information required 
by Final Rule 265, even if the applicant must take 
action to acquire that information. 

Finally, the district court found that Final Rules 
75 and 265 improperly shift the burden away from 
the examiner and onto the applicant. Tafas II, 541 
F.Supp.2d at 817. The court relied on the language 
in § 102 that “[a] person shall be entitled to a patent 
unless,” along with the requirement in § 131 that 
“[t]he director shall cause an examination to be 
made of the application.” Id. Additionally, the district 
court noted that this court's precedent places 
the burden of putting forth a prima facie case of unpatentability 
on the USPTO. See In re Oetiker, 977 
F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed.Cir.1992). We agree with the 
district court that the USPTO bears the initial burden 
of proving unpatentability, but disagree that the 
ESD requirement shifts that burden. Final Rules 75 
and 265 do not require an applicant to make a 
prima facie case of patentability. While the rules require 
an applicant to conduct a prior art search and 
report his view of why the invention is patentable 
based on the results, the content of this disclosure 

does not change the standards by which the application 
is examined. An examiner cannot reject an application 
because he believes that the applicant 
failed to find the most material references or if he is 
otherwise not persuaded by the applicant's view of 
the prior art. Even under the new rules, the examiner 
must examine the application in accordance 
with § 131 and the applicant will be “entitled to a 
patent unless” the examiner can make a prima facie 
case of unpatentability. 35 U.S.C. § 102. Thus, 
while creating an additional procedural step for the 
submission of applications, the ESD requirement 
does not alter the ultimate burdens of the examiner 
or applicant during examination. 

III. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the 
Final Rules 75, 78, 114, and 265 are procedural 
rules that are within the scope of the USPTO's rule-
making authority. However, we find that Final Rule 
78 conflicts with 35 U.S.C. § 120 and is thus invalid. 
Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant 
of summary judgment that Final Rule 78 is invalid, 
vacate its grant of summary judgment with respect 
to Final Rules 75, 114, and 265, and remand for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

*1365 Because of the complexity of this case 
and the numerous arguments presented on appeal 
and before the district court, we think it is important 
to expressly summarize what we believe remains 
for the district court on remand. This opinion 
does not decide any of the following issues: whether 
any of the Final Rules, either on their face or as 
applied in any specific circumstances, are arbitrary 
and capricious; whether any of the Final Rules conflict 
with the Patent Act in ways not specifically addressed 
in this opinion; whether all USPTO rule-
making is subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
under 5 U.S.C. § 553; whether any of the Final 
Rules are impermissibly vague; and whether the Final 
Rules are impermissibly retroactive.

AND REMANDED 

BRYSON, Circuit Judge, concurring. 

I join Judge Prost's opinion but with the following 
observations. 

1. In my view, the question whether the PTO is 
authorized to promulgate particular regulations 
does not turn on an abstract inquiry into whether a 
particular rule can be characterized as substantive, 
procedural, or interpretive. Instead, it calls on us to 
ask what Congress has empowered the PTO to do 
through rulemaking. Congress has not used the 
broadest available language in the statute that authorizes 
the PTO to engage in rulemaking, but 
neither has it used the narrowest. Congress could 
have authorized the PTO to issue any regulations 
that are necessary or appropriate to administer the 
patent laws. See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. § 501 (Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs authorized to prescribe “all rules 
and regulations which are necessary or appropriate 
to carry out the laws administered by the Department”); 
5 U.S.C. § 8347(a) (Office of Personnel 
Management given authority to prescribe “such regulations 
as are necessary and proper to carry out 
[the Civil Service Retirement Act]”). Language of 
that sort would have given the PTO the very broad 
rulemaking authority. On the other hand, the PTO 
could have given no special authority to promulgate 
regulations, which would have had the effect of 
limiting the PTO to the narrow scope of 5 U.S.C. § 
301, which allows all agencies to prescribe regulations 
“for the government of ... [the] department, 
the conduct of its employees, the distribution and 
performance of its business, and the custody, use, 
and preservation of its records, papers, and property.” 
Congress did neither. Instead, it charted a 
middle course in 35 U.S.C. § 2(b), permitting the 
agency somewhat broader regulatory powers than 
are contemplated by section 301, but narrower than 
the broad “necessary or appropriate” rulemaking 
authority given to some other agencies. 
Section 2(b)(2)(A) of the Patent Act vests the 
PTO with authority to promulgate regulations that 

“govern the conduct of proceedings in the Office.” 
The subject matter that most clearly falls within the 
scope of that provision is the admission and discipline 
of attorneys practicing before the PTO. See, 
e.g., Bender v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368 
(Fed.Cir.2007); Lacavera v. Dudas, 441 F.3d 1380, 
1383 (Fed.Cir.2006). Even apart from that context, 
however, we have taken a fairly expansive view of 
the scope of section 2(b)(2)(A). For example, in In 
re Sullivan, we held that section 2(b)(2)(A) authorized 
the PTO to promulgate a regulation permitting 
conferences between an administrative patent judge 
and the parties to an interference proceeding. 362 
F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2004). Also in the interference 
context, we held in Stevens v. Tamai that 
the PTO acted within its authority under *1366section 
2(b)(2)(A) when it promulgated regulations establishing 
that the movant has the burden of proof 
and duty of translating earlier filed documents into 
English, so as to show that the international application 
contains the same disclosure as the national 
stage application. 366 F.3d 1325, 1332 
(Fed.Cir.2004). Finally, in Cooper Technologies 
Co. v. Dudas, we held that the PTO was entitled to 
promulgate a regulation defining the term “original 
application” in a statutory provision that established 
the procedures for inter partes reexamination, and 
that the regulation was entitled to Chevron deference. 
536 F.3d 1330, 1336-38 (Fed.Cir.2008). 

For essentially the reasons given by the majority 
opinion and in light of the above-cited authorities, 
I am satisfied that the regulations in this case 
are of the type that Congress authorized in section 
2(b) of the Patent Act, as that provision has been 
construed by this court. While I think it is generally 
fair to characterize that statute as authorizing the 
promulgation of “procedural” regulations, however, 
I do not think it necessary, or particularly helpful, 
to consider whether those regulations would be 
deemed “substantive,” “interpretive,” or 
“procedural” either under section 4 of the Administrative 
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, or under statutory 
schemes applicable to other agencies.

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

The same approach seems to me to be called 
for in deciding whether the agency is entitled to deference 
with respect to the scope of its own authority. 
There, too, the issue comes down to one of statutory 
construction-whether Congress left the 
boundaries of agency authority undefined and subject 
to refinement through the exercise of agency 
expertise, or whether Congress established a firm 
line, enforceable by courts, beyond which the 
agency could not venture. Normally, Congress 
defines the field of agency rulemaking authority in 
unambiguous terms that are readily applied by 
courts, so there is little reason to resort to Chevron-
type analysis. In some instances, however, Congress 
has defined the agency's rulemaking jurisdiction 
using vague terms, or terms that call for agency 
interpretation, or even terms that expressly leave 
the scope of rulemaking authority to the agency to 
decide; in those cases, deference to the agency may 
be appropriate or even necessary. See, e.g., Bender 

v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2007) 
(deference given to PTO's interpretation of the 
phrase “before the Office” in section 2(b)(2)); 
Enercon GmbH v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 151 F.3d 
1376, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir.1998) (deference given to 
ITC's interpretation of the word “sale” in the statute 
giving it jurisdiction, 15 U.S.C. § 1337); 5 U.S.C. § 
7701(a) (authorizing Merit Systems Protection 
Board to act on appeals authorized by “any law, 
rule, or regulation”). In this case, it is unnecessary 
to decide whether deference would be due to the 
agency's interpretation of its own authority, as we 
conclude, even without deference, that the agency 
has authority to issue regulations of the sort issued 
in this case, subject to their consistency with the 
underlying statutory provisions being interpreted. 

Because I agree with Judge Prost that the challenged 
regulations are within the scope of the authorization 
that Congress granted to the PTO in section 
2(b), I likewise conclude that the issue in this 
case comes down to whether the challenged regulations 
are consistent with other provisions of the Patent 
Act. 

2. On the merits, the most difficult question in 
this case for me is whether Final Rule 78 is a valid 
regulation in light of 35 U.S.C. § 120. My colleagues 
conclude that it is invalid, although for different 
reasons. I agree that it is invalid for the reasons 
given by Judge Prost, although*1367 I think it 
is important to emphasize the narrow scope of the 
court's decision. 
The court holds that Final Rule 78 is invalid 
because it limits the number of continuation applications 
that may be filed and applies that limit even 
if all of the continuation applications are filed while 
the first application is still pending. Section 120 
plainly provides that any application that satisfies 
the other requirements of the statute and is “filed 
before the patenting or abandonment of or termination 
of proceedings on the first application” shall 
have the same effect “as though filed on the date of 
the prior application.” 35 U.S.C. § 120. Therefore, 
a rule limiting the number of continuances co-
pending with the first-filed application is necessarily 
contrary to the statute and invalid. 

While that is a sufficient reason to invalidate 
Final Rule 78, it does not answer the question 
whether the rule is invalid as applied to serial continuances, 
i.e., a series of continuances in which 
each was co-pending with its immediate predecessor, 
but in which only the second in the series 
was co-pending with the first application. Under 
current law, all continuances in such a series, if 
they satisfy the other requirements of section 120, 
are deemed to have the same effective date as the 
first application. Rule 78 would change that practice. 


The question whether the new Rule's restrictions 
on serial continuances would also be invalid is 
more complex than the question of the validity of 
restrictions on co-pending applications. As to serial 
continuances, section 120 provides that an application 
for continued prosecution is entitled to the benefit 
of an earlier priority date when it is co-
pending with “an application similarly entitled to 
the benefit of the filing date of the first applica

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

tion.” For the last 40 years, that portion of section 
120 has been understood to confer upon patent applicants 
the right to file any number of successive 
continuation applications after the first application 
has been abandoned or issued as a patent. That was 
the construction of section 120 that our predecessor 
court adopted in 1968, overturning a Patent Office 
Board of Appeals decision to the contrary. In re 

Henriksen, 55 C.C.P.A. 1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254 
(1968). It would not be unreasonable, however, to 
construe the phrase “an application similarly entitled” 
to mean an application that satisfies all the 
preceding requirements set forth in section 120, including 
the requirement of co-pendency with the 
initial application, which was the construction adopted 
by the Patent Office Board of Appeals in the 
Henriksen case. See Ex parte Henriksen, 154 

U.S.P.Q. 53 (1966). In fact, the court in Henriksen 
acknowledged that a literal reading of the statutory 
language would lead to that conclusion. In re Henriksen, 
399 F.2d at 256, 260-61 & n. 18. Under that 
interpretation, applicants would be limited to a 
maximum of two continuations in series-one while 
the first application is pending and another while 
the first continuation is pending. Because the term 
“similarly entitled” admits of two reasonable constructions, 
the PTO could have adopted the narrower 
construction notwithstanding prior judicial precedent 
construing the statute in the absence of a 
regulation interpreting the statutory language. See 
Nat'l Cable & Telecomms. Assn' v. Brand X Internet 
Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 982-86, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 
162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005). 

The court today properly strikes down Final 
Rule 78 because its restrictions on co-pending, or 
parallel, continuations is contrary to the plain language 
of section 120, which provides that such a 
co-pending continuation “shall” be given the same 
priority date as the original application and which 
contains no restriction on the numbers of such applications 
that are permitted. That is not to say, 
however, that a revised rule that addressed only 
serial continuances*1368 and limited such continuances 
to only two-the first co-pending with the ori


ginal application and the second co-pending with 
the first-would be struck down as reflecting an impermissible 
interpretation of section 120. That is 
not a question that we need to-or should-decide 
today, but in my view it is important to emphasize 
that the question remains open. 

RADER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting 
in part. 

I concur with this court's conclusion that the 
PTO is not entitled to Chevron deference with respect 
to its own rulemaking authority. However, in 
my view, the Final Rules are substantive, not procedural. 
Thus, I would affirm the district court's 
conclusion that the PTO exceeded its statutory rule-
making authority in promulgating these rules. For 
that reason, I concur in part with this court's ultimate 
conclusion regarding Final Rule 78, but dissent 
in part with respect to Final Rules 114, 75, and 

265. 
This case presents a threshold question about 
the nature of these rules-substantive or procedural. 
The organic act of the PTO “does NOT grant the 
Commissioner the authority to issue substantive 
rules.” Merck & Co. v. Kessler, 80 F.3d 1543, 1550 
(Fed.Cir.1996) (emphasis in original). Unlike 
grants of rulemaking authority to many other administrative 
agencies, the PTO does not enjoy substantive 
rulemaking authority. Accordingly, the legislative 
branch has retained the responsibility for 
developing substantive patent law. To the extent 
that the PTO's Final Rules are substantive, this 
court cannot permit the PTO to exceed its authority. 

The distinction between substantive or non-
substantive rules requires a difficult judgment. This 
distinction arises most often in the context of interpreting 
the exception to the requirement for notice 
and comment procedures in the Administrative Procedure 
Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A). In the 
most common scenario, an agency has promulgated 
a rule without undergoing the strictures of notice 
and comment rulemaking. The reviewing court 
must then, when necessary, apply the APA's exemption 
for “interpretative rules, general statements

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, 
or practice.” Id. In other words, the courts may 
only sustain non-substantive rulemaking in those 
cases. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Quigg, 
932 F.2d 920 (Fed.Cir.1991); JEM Broad. Co. v. 
FCC, 22 F.3d 320 (D.C.Cir.1994); Am. Hosp. Ass'n 

v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037 (D.C.Cir.1987). These 
cases have set forth a balancing test to identify a 
non-substantive rule: a rule is sufficiently non-
substantive “where the policies promoted by public 
participation in rulemaking are outweighed by the 
countervailing considerations of effectiveness, efficiency, 
expedition and reduction in expense.” 
Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Fed. Sav. & 
Loan Ins. Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 662 (D.C.Cir.1978). 

The instant case, however, presents a different 
situation. These PTO rules have no procedural defects. 
Instead, this case asks this court to ensure that 
the PTO has not exceeded its rulemaking authority. 
Thus, in the present context, this court misapplies 
the teachings of cases such as Animal Legal Defense 
Fund and Cooper Technologies Co. v. Dudas, 
536 F.3d 1330 (Fed.Cir.2008). These cases focus 
on the distinction between “interpretative” and 
“substantive” rules. Parsing the difference between 
“interpretive,” “procedural,” and “policy” rules 
may be relevant in the context of categorizing a 
rule into one of the APA's exceptions to notice and 
comment rulemaking, but has no relevance to the 
question of exceeding a grant of rulemaking authority. 
In the unique context of this case, it makes no 
sense to classify a *1369 rule as “procedural” or 
“interpretative.” Either of those labels leads to the 
same conclusion-that the rule is non-substantive. 
See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336 (finding the 
PTO's interpretation of “original application” in 35 

U.S.C. § 4608 to be “procedural” within the meaning 
of 35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2) because it was “ 
‘interpretative’ ... rather than ‘substantive’ ”); see 
also Animal Legal Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927 
(contrasting “substantive” rules with the general 
category of “exempt ‘interpretative’ rules of section 
553(b)”). Thus, I would not so casually discard, as 
this court does today, this court's precedent for 
identifying a “substantive” rule. 

The Supreme Court provided valuable guidance 
on the substantive/nonsubstantive inquiry in 
Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 
1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). In Chrysler, the 
Court defined an inherent characteristic of a 
“substantive” or “legislative-type” rule, namely, 
such rules “affect [ ] individual rights and obligations.” 
Id. at 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705. Contrary to this 
court's analysis today, the Chrysler Court's reasoning 
was in no way limited to defining the boundary 
between interpretative and substantive rules. The 
Court sought to draw a broad distinction between 
substantive and non-substantive rules-the same inquiry 
presented in this case. Id. Shedding light on 
this distinction, the Court recognized that “[a] 
‘substantive rule’ is not defined in the APA,” but 
that the term is best defined by “negative inference. 
” Id. at 301-02, 99 S.Ct. 1705 (emphasis added). 
Put differently, a rule is “substantive” if it is not an 
“interpretive rule[ ], general statement[ ] of policy, 
or rule[ ] of agency organization, procedure, or 
practice.” Id. at 301, 99 S.Ct. 1705. 

Both this court and the Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit have relied on 
Chrysler in building a body of jurisprudence germane 
to the substantive/nonsubstantive inquiry. 
Central to this jurisprudence is the recognition that 
classifying a rule as substantive or non-substantive 
is a case-by-case exercise, poorly suited for bright-
line rules. See, e.g., Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1045 
(“Determining whether a given agency action is interpretive 
or legislative is an extraordinarily case-
specific endeavor.... [A]nalogizing to prior cases is 
often of limited utility in light of the exceptional 
degree to which decisions in this doctrinal area turn 
on their precise facts.”); Chamber of Commerce v. 
Dep't of Labor, 174 F.3d 206, 212 (D.C.Cir.1999) 
(“[T]he question whether a rule is substantive or 
procedural for the purposes of § 553(b) is functional, 
not formal.”). 

No doubt, the Chrysler Court's inquiry-whether 
a rule “affects individual rights and obligations”-if

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

analyzed in a vacuum, would blur the line between 
substantive and non-substantive rules. See, e.g., 
Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1046 (“[T]he mere fact that a 
rule may have a substantial impact does not transform 
it into a legislative rule.”); Neighborhood TV 
Co. v. FCC, 742 F.2d 629, 637 (D.C.Cir.1984) 

(“[E]very change in rules will have some effect on 
those regulated.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
For this reason, as the D.C. Circuit stated in 
JEM, the “critical feature” of a procedural, non-
substantive rule is that “it covers agency actions 
that do not themselves alter the rights or interests of 
parties, although it may alter the manner in which 
the parties present themselves or their viewpoints to 
the agency.” JEM, 22 F.3d at 326. Although the 
court's opinion today seizes upon this instructive 
language from JEM, it sadly overlooks JEM's ensuing 
statement: “[t]he issue, therefore, is one of degree 
... our task is to identify which substantive effects 
are sufficiently grave ....” Id. at 327 (emphases 
added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Assessing 
the challenged *1370 FCC rule's impact, which 
merely curtailed “a license applicant's right to a 
free shot at amending its application,” the court in 
JEM concluded that the rule was “not so significant 
” as to be classified as substantive. Id. (emphasis 
added). Thus, as JEM illustrates, the test for substantive, 
ultra vires rules is a case-by-case inquiry, 
not a rigid application of a sentence out of context 
in JEM. 

To my eyes, this question of degree must guide 
this court's assessment of the substantive nature of 
the PTO's Final Rules. This court has confronted 
that question before and gauged a rule's impact on 
parties' rights and obligations by examining the 
rules' changes to existing law or policy. See, e.g., 
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336; Animal Legal 
Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927. The D.C. Circuit has 
also adopted this language as relevant to the inquiry. 
See, e.g., Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1045 
(“Substantive rules are ones which grant rights, impose 
obligations, or produce other significant effects 
on private interests, or which effect a change 
in existing law or policy.”) (internal citations and 

quotation marks omitted). For example, in Cooper 
Technologies, this court held that a PTO rule giving 
effect to the term “original application” was non-
substantive because it “does not effect any change 
in existing law or policy; rather, it is a prospective 
clarification of ambiguous statutory language regarding 
a matter of procedure.” 536 F.3d at 1336. 
Similarly, in Bowen, a manual promulgated by the 
Department of Health and Human Services was a 
“classic procedural rule[ ]” because, in mapping 
out an enforcement strategy for third party contractors, 
it “impose[d] no new burdens on hospitals.” 
Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1050-51. 

The D.C. Circuit's 1999 decision in Chamber 
of Commerce is particularly instructive. 174 F.3d at 

206. In that case, the court considered a new directive 
promulgated by the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (“OSHA”) establishing a 
new compliance program for dangerous workplaces. 
Id. at 208. The Directive provided that the 
agency would reduce the probability of an onerous 
inspection if a workplace implemented a so-called 
comprehensive safety and health program 
(“CSHP”). Id. Although “[m]ost of the [CSHP] requirements 
are procedural,” the Directive was clear 
that compliance with the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act was “not in itself sufficient” for compliance 
with the newly promulgated CSHP. Id. 
Plaintiffs challenged the Directive on the ground 
that it was a substantive rule, and OSHA had not 
undergone the requisite notice and comment procedures. 
Id. at 209. The court agreed with the 
plaintiffs, holding that the rule was substantive 
“[a]t least to the extent that participation in the CCP 
requires more than adherence to existing law....” Id. 
at 211 (emphasis added). Indeed, because the Directive 
imposed upon employers “more than the incidental 
inconveniences of complying with an enforcement 
scheme,” it was plainly substantive. Id. 
at 211-12 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Implicit in the majority's holding that the Final 
Rules are procedural is that the rules fit within the 
“procedural” exception to the APA's notice and

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

comment requirement. Yet applying this logic, the 
PTO would never be subject to the APA's notice 
and comment procedures because it only has statutory 
authority to promulgate rules that fall within 
exceptions to notice and comment, i.e., non-
substantive rules. Here, the PTO provided a notice 
and comment period. In other words, the PTO recognized 
that “the policies promoted by public participation 
in rulemaking ... outweigh[ed] ... countervailing 
considerations of effectiveness, efficiency, 
expedition and reduction in expense.” See Guardian 
Federal, 589 F.2d at 662 (providing that notice 
and comment is not required*1371 when these 
“countervailing considerations trump public participation”). 
The public participation during that 
period was overwhelming (itself an indication of 
the substantive impact of the rules?). Many of the 
comments shared a common concern: that the Final 
Rules “had a significant effect on private interests, 
and marked a change in existing law or policy.” I 
share that concerned view. 

II 

Contrary to this court's holding today, the Final 
Rules are not “incidental inconveniences of complying 
with an enforcement scheme.” The Final 
Rules are substantive. The Final Rules affect individual 
rights and obligations, and mark a startling 
change in existing law and patent policy. As the 
district court correctly noted, 

The 2+1 Rule and the 5/25 Rule, which limit continuing 
applications, RCEs, and claims, and the 
ESD requirement, which shifts the examination 
burden onto applicants, constitute a drastic departure 
from the terms of the Patent Act as they 
are presently understood. By so departing, the Final 
Rules effect changes in GSK's and Tafas's existing 
rights and obligations. 

Tafas v. Dudas, 541 F.Supp.2d 805, 814 
(E.D.Va.2008) (emphasis added). I will briefly consider 
each Final Rule in turn. 

A. Final Rule 78 
Final Rule 78 restricts to two the number of 
continuation applications entitled to an earlier priority 
date, unless the applicant files a petition 
showing that the amendment, argument, or evidence 
could not have been submitted during the prosecution 
of the prior-filed application (“petition and 
showing”). As this court notes today, that rule contravenes 
the language of 35 U.S.C. § 120. The statute 
is clear: later filed continuation applications 
“shall have the same effect, as to such invention, as 
though filed on the date of the prior application.” 
35 U.S.C. § 120 (emphasis added). Final Rule 78 is 
not “a prospective clarification of ambiguous statutory 
language regarding a matter of procedure,” 
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336, because the statute 
mandates that continuations “shall have the 
same effect.” Section 120 creates a substantive 
right to claim the earlier priority date in later-filed 
continuation applications. 

In fact, this court's predecessor considered the 
language of 35 U.S.C. § 120: “[T]here is no statutory 
basis for fixing an arbitrary limit to the number 
of [continuing] applications” that can retain the 
benefit of the priority date. In re Henriksen, 55 

C.C.P.A. 1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254 (1968). The 
court recognized that placing “a limit upon continuing 
applications is a matter of policy for the Congress.” 
In re Hogan, 559 F.2d 595, 604 n. 13 
(CCPA 1977). In other words, Final Rule 78 attempts 
to usurp legislative prerogatives. If the Act 
contemplated a limit on the number of continuation 
applications available as a matter of right, then a 
limitation to that effect would appear in § 120. Instead 
§ 120 says the opposite. 
The Office argues that Final Rule 78 is not substantive 
because the petition and showing requirement 
provides an alternative avenue for seeking additional 
continuations. The PTO's argument admits 
far too much. In order to receive the benefit of priority 
for later-filed continuation applications, which 
was previously available as a matter or right, the 
applicant must now justify the right with further 
showings. This new “petition and showing” hurdle 
is neither required nor contemplated by § 120. In

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

mechanically applying only one statement from 
JEM, the majority opinion ignores that the 
“substantive effect” of failing to meet this new obligation-
the loss of priority date-is “sufficiently 
*1372 grave” to make this rule substantive. See 
JEM, 22 F.3d at 327. 

B. Final Rule 114 
The same holds true with respect to Final Rule 
114, imposing a limit of one request for continued 
examination (“RCE”) per application family. The 
American Inventor's Protection Act of 1999 stated 
that the RCE provisions “shall apply to all applications” 
filed on or after June 8, 1995. The Act did 
not impose or contemplate a restrictive RCE practice. 
To the contrary, subject to the doctrine of prosecution 
laches, applicants could file an RCE as a 
matter of right. 

The impact and reach of the Final Rules 78 and 
114 (“the 2+1 Rule”) significantly affects patent 
prosecution. Several amicus briefs point out reasonable 
scenarios where an applicant may choose to 
file an RCE during prosecution, e.g., in order to 
provoke an interference, to clarify claim scope in 
anticipation of litigation, and to submit an information 
disclosure statement (“IDS”). Yet these Final 
Rules could interfere with those reasonable scenarios. 


By way of example, consider the following 
scenario: An applicant receives a Notice of Allowance 
for application A. Before paying the issue fee, 
the applicant discovers a material prior art reference 
in a foreign application. Mindful of the duty to 
disclose material information to the Office, that applicant 
would file an RCE, an IDS citing the reference, 
and an amendment to account for the newly 
discovered prior art. So far so good, but what if the 
reference is not only material to application A, but 
also material to continuation applications B and C, 
members of the same application family that have 
also received Notices of Allowance? Under the 2+1 
Rule, the applicant would have exhausted the two 
continuations and one RCE. What happens to applications 
B and C? Even if the submission of 

newly-discovered prior art satisfied the “petition 
and showing” requirement (which the PTO has said 
it will likely not), the “petition and showing” requirement 
is legislative because it imposes a new 
burden on the inventor. Because they require “more 
than adherence to existing law,” Final Rules 78 and 
114 are substantive. See Chamber of Commerce, 
174 F.3d at 211. 

C. Final Rule 75 
Final Rule 75 limits an application to five independent 
claims or twenty-five claims total. Placing 
an arbitrary limit on the number of claims in an application 
drastically affects an applicant's rights and 
obligations under the Patent Act. To be specific, 
this rule alters obligations under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 
103, 112, and 131. For instance, § 112, ¶ 2 requires 
that “[t]he specification shall conclude with one or 
more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly 
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards 
as his invention.” 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2 
(emphasis added). Placing a mechanical cap on the 
number of claims in an application hinders an applicant's 
right (and obligation) to “particularly 
[point] out and distinctly [claim] the subject matter 
which the applicant regards as his invention.” Id. 
Indeed, “one or more claims” suggests at least one, 
not a ceiling to the number of claims in an application. 
Once again, if the Act wished to specify an 
upper limit on the number of claims, it could do so 
right at this point. Instead the “or more” requirement 
places no limit on the number of claims. The 
Act instead articulates a clear policy in favor of allowing 
as many claims as an applicant is willing to 
pay for. 

As the majority opinion acknowledges, this 
court's precedent suggests no limit on the number 
of claims. See *1373In re Wakefield, 57 C.C.P.A. 
959, 422 F.2d 897, 900 (1970) (“[A]n applicant 
should be allowed to determine the necessary number 
and scope of his claims....”); In re Chandler, 50 

C.C.P.A. 1422, 319 F.2d 211, 225 (1963) 
(“[A]pplicants should be allowed reasonable latitude 
in stating their claims in regard to number and

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129 

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345) 

phraseology employed. The right of applicants to 
freedom of choice in selecting phraseology which 
truly points out and defines their inventions should 
not be abridged.”). This court should and does understand 
that some inventions are easier to describe, 
or lend themselves well to drawings. Others are 
more complicated and may take several iterations 
of claims in order to capture and fully disclose 
one's invention. 

By analogy, this rule has a similar effect to imposing 
a five-page limit on applications. Although 
that notion is obviously too simplistic and problematic, 
this court's rationale would apparently make 
that hypothetical rule possible as a procedural rule 
that merely “[alters] the manner in which the 
parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the 
agency.” JEM, 22 F.3d at 326. To my eyes, much 
more is at stake. 

Likewise, limiting an applicant to five independent 
claims ignores the varying scopes and 
methods of claiming inventions across different 
technologies. For example, in a pharmaceutical application, 
an applicant may claim not only the 
genus compound, but also a number of species, intermediates, 
methods of making, and methods of 
use. Asking an inventor to limit her application to 
five independent claims disproportionately affects 
technologies with greater complexity and greater 
public interest in disclosure. See Neighborhood TV, 
742 F.2d at 637 (“In determining whether a rule is 
substantive, we must look at its effect on those interests 
ultimately at stake in the agency proceeding.”). 


This court today forgets that an inventor's incentive 
to disclose is commensurate with the protection 
available. With less ability to claim myriad 
methods of making, methods of use, species and intermediates, 
and more, an inventor will have less 
incentive to disclose the full dimension of the technological 
advance. Final Rule 75 frustrates the quid 
pro quo contemplated by the Patent Act. 

D. Final Rule 265 
On appeal, the PTO submits that limiting an 
application to five independent claims, or twenty-
five claims total, is not a mechanical limitation, but 
just a trigger to the requirement to file an Examination 
Support Document (“ESD”). Final Rule 265 
goes too far, however, by requiring an applicant to 
“conduct a broad search of patents, patent applications, 
and literature, and provide, among other 
things, a ‘detailed explanation’ of ‘how each of the 
independent claims is patentable over the cited references.’ 
” Tafas, 541 F.Supp.2d at 816 (quoting 37 

C.F.R. § 1.265(a)). Setting aside its onerous burden 
and its risk to cause later allegations of inequitable 
conduct, the ESD requirement improperly shifts the 
burden of proving patentability onto the applicant-a 
direct conflict with this court's interpretation of section 
102. 
Section 102 provides “[a] person shall be entitled 
to a patent unless ” and section 131 provides 
that “[t]he director shall cause an examination to be 
made of the application.” 35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 131. 
Thus, the PTO bears the burden of putting forth a 
prima facie case of unpatentability. See In re Oetiker, 
977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed.Cir.1992). Indeed, 
this court has recognized that an applicant does not 
have the duty to perform a prior art search. Frazier 

v. Roessel Cine Photo Tech, Inc., 417 F.3d 1230, 
1238 (Fed.Cir.2005). 
*1374 Although this court has upheld the 
PTO's authority to request “such information as 
may be reasonably necessary to properly examine 
or treat the matter,” Star Fruits S.N.C. v. United 
States, 393 F.3d 1277, 1282 (Fed.Cir.2005), Rule 
105 relates to information that is already in the applicants' 
possession; it does not impose an affirmative 
duty to perform a prior art search or opine regarding 
patentability over the closest reference. See 
37 C.F.R. § 1.105. In contrast, the ESD requirement 
places a new obligation on the inventor. The ESD is 
something more than supplying the Office with an 
English language translation or turning over information 
already in the applicant's possession. It 
shifts the burden of proving patentability onto the

applicant. 

This shift of the burden of proof (or production, 
for that matter) onto the applicant significantly 
alters practice before the PTO and represents “a 
change in existing law or policy.” Animal Legal 
Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927. Satisfaction of the ESD 
requirement requires “more than adherence to existing 
law” and amounts to “more than the incidental 
inconveniences of complying with an enforcement 
scheme.” See Chamber of Commerce, 174 F.3d at 
211-12. As such, Final Rules 75 and 265 are substantive. 


III 

Because the Final Rules drastically change the 
existing law and alter an inventor's rights and obligations 
under the Patent Act, they are substantive 
and the PTO exceeded its statutory rulemaking authority 
under 35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2). For the reasons 
stated above, I would affirm.

Donald Kyle, and Robert Kupper's (“Chapman's”) 

U.S. Patent Application No. 11/391,897 (“the '897 
application”) and Michael Casner, Jen-Sen Dung, 
Erno Keskeny, and Jin Luo's (“Casner's”) U.S. Patent 
No. 7,153,966 (“the '966 patent”) both claim 
methods of preparing oxycodone that reduce the 
levels of a potentially toxic intermediate, 
14-hydroxycodeinone. In Interference No. 105,553, 
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (“the 
Board”) granted Casner's motion seeking judgment 
that Chapman claims 96-118 were unpatentable under 
35 U.S.C. § 103(a). Chapman appeals, asking 
us to hold claims 96-118 of the '897 application 
nonobvious. Casner maintains that those claims 
were obvious, but has also lodged a cross-appeal, 
arguing that if we reverse the Board's holdings as to 
the '897 application, we should reverse its holdings 
on the '966 patent and remand for a priority determination. 
For the reasons set forth below, we affirm 
the Board's obviousness determination. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The '897 application is entitled “Process for 
Preparing Oxycodone Hydrochloride Having Less 
Than 25 ppm 14-Hydroxycodeinone.” The only independent 
claim at issue is claim 96, which recites: 

A process for preparing oxycodone or an oxycodone 
salt, which process comprises steps of: 

(a) preparing a mixture of oxycodone, solvent 
and an acid; 
(b) incubating the mixture under conditions suitable 
to promote reaction of 8, 14-dihydroxy-7, 
8-dihydrocodeinone to 14-hydroxycodeinone; 
and subsequently 
(c) exposing the mixture to hydrogenation reagents 
under conditions sufficient for conversion 
of 14-hydroxycodeinone to oxycodone. 
J.A. 77 (emphases added). 
Oxycodone is a synthetic analgesic opioid used 
to relieve pain. Typically, one prepares oxycodone 
by first oxidizing thebaine. This step converts 

thebaine into two types of compounds: 
14-hydroxycodeinone (“14-hydroxy”) and the 8, 
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinones (collectively, 
“8, 14-dihydroxys”). The 14-hydroxy is converted 
via hydrogenation into oxycodone, which is then 
treated with acid during a final “salting” step to 
yield pharmaceutical grade oxycodone. Any 
14-hydroxy remaining at the end of the reaction is 
problematic, as the compound is potentially toxic. 

The 8, 14-dihydroxys created during the initial 
oxidation step are stereoisomers-*296 there are two 
forms, designated “8á” and an “8â,” that differ only 
by the relative orientation of a hydroxyl group. 
Chapman claims that prior to the '897 application, 
persons of ordinary skill in the art did not know that 
8á formed during the reaction. Instead, they believed 
that thebaine oxidized to form 14-hydroxy 
and 8â, and that any 14-hydroxy remaining at the 
end of the reaction was leftover, unreacted 
14-hydroxy. In fact, during the salting step at least 
one of the 8, 14-dihydroxys reacts with acid to form 
“new” 14-hydroxy; this 14-hydroxy can then, of 
course, undergo hydrogenation to become additional 
oxycodone. 

**2 Chapman argues that he was the first to recognize 
that additional 14-hydroxy is created from 
8á during the reaction's salting step, and that the 
“new” 14-hydroxy can therefore yield additional 
oxycodone. Chapman purports to claim this method 
of eliminating the “new” 14-hydroxy in claim 96. 
The claim does not, however, differentiate between 
the 8á and 8â forms of 8, 14-dihydroxy, nor does 
the claim language specifically disclose which conditions 
are “suitable” for promoting the desired reaction 
from 8, 14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy. 

We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 
1295(a)(4)(A). 

II. DISCUSSION 
Obviousness is a legal conclusion based on underlying 
findings of fact. In re DBC, 545 F.3d 
1373, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2008). We review the Board's 
ultimate determination of obviousness de novo,

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 3 

315 Fed.Appx. 294, 2009 WL 606065 (C.A.Fed.) 

(Not Selected for publication in the Federal Reporter) 
(Cite as: 315 Fed.Appx. 294, 2009 WL 606065 (C.A.Fed.)) 

while we review the Board's underlying factual 
findings for substantial evidence. Id. 

We first turn to Chapman's arguments. Chapman 
claims that prior to the '897 application, no one 
knew that 8á was formed during thebaine oxidation. 
Nor, according to Chapman, was it known that 8á 
could react with acid under certain “commercial 
conditions” to form additional 14-hydroxy. Chapman 
admits that the prior art disclosed 8â, but 
claims that “under commercial oxycodone production 
conditions,” 8â converts into a benign salt, not 
into 14-hydroxy. In his view, the prior art would 
lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to believe 
that 8â must be treated with “stronger than commercially 
used” amounts of hydrochloric acid before 
it converts to 14-hydroxy. 

Casner states that Chapman never claimed 8á 
as crucial to the invention before the Board; in other 
words, Chapman never tried to distinguish the 
prior art based on stereochemistry. Casner likewise 
argues that Chapman waived any “commercial conditions” 
limitation. Chapman responds that both issues 
were raised, although the stereochemistry argument 
is emphasized on appeal because Casner 
did not produce the “Proksa” reference (upon which 
the Board relied) until its response, leaving Chapman 
little opportunity to analyze and respond to the 
specific issues raised by that reference. Chapman 
also argues that since the Board identified a 
“commercial need” for reduced levels of 
14-hydroxy, and found that a person of skill in the 
art would work in the “highly competitive pharmaceutical 
industry,” the Board understood that commercial 
conditions were at issue. 

Chapman does not direct us to specific arguments 
in submissions to the Board where counsel 
pursued the claim that commercial conditions were 
necessary; nor has Chapman clarified which conditions 
would qualify as “commercial conditions.” 
Similarly, although 8á is identified in some of the 
'897 application's figures, and Chapman's expert 
made references to stereoisomers in reviewing the 
prior art, Chapman has not identified any statement 

before the Board that explicitly differentiated*297 
between the invention and the prior art based on 
stereochemistry. 

**3 Regardless, we need not resolve the waiver 
issue definitively. Chapman maintains, and we 
agree, that “[t]he term ‘8, 14-dihydroxy’ properly 
includes 8á, but there is no reason for that term to 
be limited to that isomer in Chapman's claims. The 
term ‘conditions' properly includes commercial 
conditions, but there is no reason to limit that term 
to commercial conditions in Chapman's claims.” 
Appellant's Reply Br. 27. Further, the '897 application 
states: “The term 8, 14-dihydroxy-7, 
8-dihydrocodeinone includes either 8á, 
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinone; or 8â, 
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinone or can include 
a mixture of both compounds.” '897 application ¶ 
0043. 

Thus, claim 96 merely requires one to incubate 
the mixture “under conditions suitable to promote 
reaction” of 8, 14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy. Therefore, 
prior art references that disclose either the 8á 
or 8â form of 8, 14-dihydroxy converting to 
14-hydroxy, or disclose any reaction condition 
(whether “commercial” or not) that promotes the 
conversion of 8á or 8â to 14-hydroxy, may render 
the claim obvious. See In re May, 574 F.2d 1082, 
1088-89 (C.C.P.A.1978) (“[The reference] expressly 
discloses ... a species within the genus of 
claim 1. Therefore, [the reference] is a technical anticipation 
of claim 1. Appellants' assertions to the 
contrary notwithstanding, this finding does not constitute 
a new ground of rejection; lack of novelty is 
the epitome of obviousness.”); cf. Medichem, S.A. 

v. Rolabo, S.L., 353 F.3d 928, 934-35 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (concluding that first step of an interference-
in-fact inquiry was satisfied where two 
method claims had a genus/species relationship, 
since “ ‘[i]t is ... an elementary principle of patent 
law that when, as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise, 
a claim covers several compositions, the 
claim is “anticipated” if one of them is in the prior 
art.’ ”) (quoting Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner,

778 F.2d 775, 782 (Fed.Cir.1985)); Eli Lilly & Co. 

v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 971 
(Fed.Cir.2001) (in context of an obviousness-type 
double patenting analysis, noting that “[t]he only 
other difference between [the two method claims] is 
that the former is directed to humans while the latter 
is directed to animals,” and “[o]ur case law 
firmly establishes that a later genus claim limitation 
is anticipated by, and therefore not patentably distinct 
from, an earlier species claim.”). 
The Board found that the prior art discloses 
methods under which at least one 8, 14-dihydroxy 
reacts to yield 14-hydroxy under certain conditions. 
Specifically, the Board noted that the FDA 
“recognized that there was a need to eliminate impurities 
in oxycodone,” and then proceeded to walk 
through the prior art, which disclosed: that both 
14-hydroxy and 8, 14-dihydroxy were known impurities 
during the thebaine oxidation reaction; that 
treatment of 8, 14-dihydroxy with hydrochloric acid 
converts 8, 14-dihydroxy into 14-hydroxy under 
certain reaction conditions; that one of skill in the 
art would be able to identify those conditions; and 
that 14-hydroxy may be removed from oxycodone 
via hydrogenation. 

**4 As mentioned, claim 96 would have been 
obvious if properly-combinable references disclosed 
conditions suitable to promote reaction of 8, 
14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy. The prior art references 
here do just that: they indicate that 8â, at 
least, will under certain reaction conditions form 
14-hydroxy. Given that claims directed to the genus 
(methods for eliminating 8, 14-dihydroxys) can be 
anticipated or rendered obvious by references disclosing 
the species (methods for eliminating either 
the 8á *298 or 8â form of 8, 14-dihydroxy), we 
agree with the Board that the method described in 
claim 96 would have been obvious. As a result, we 
need not address Casner's cross appeal. 

III. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons detailed above, we affirm the 
Board's decision to reject claims 96-118 of the '897 
application under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). 

RADER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

The Food and Drug Administration seeks the 
removal of impurities such as 14-hydroxy from the 
pain medicine oxycodone salt. During research on 
oxycodone, Chapman discovered that oxidation of 
thebaine creates the stereoisomer 8á, which in turn 
creates additional 14-hydroxy during formulation of 
this important pharmaceutical. Until this discovery, 
this field of art believed that the original oxidation 
step created the additional 14-hydroxy impurity. 
After discovering 8á, Chapman learned to isolate 
and hydrogenate the additional 14-hydroxy to eliminate 
most of these impurities. Chapman, thus, was 
the first person to identify the true nature of the 
“leftover” 14-hydroxy problem and the first to 
solve it. Because this important and innovative 
solution deserves a patent over the prior art, I 
would reverse the Board. 

Chapman's invention calls to mind the Supreme 
Court's resolution of Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota 
& Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45, 43 S.Ct. 
322, 67 L.Ed. 523 (1923). In Eibel, the primary distinction 
of the invention over the prior art was discovery 
of the problem in that discipline. Id. at 
67-68, 43 S.Ct. 322. Eibel discovered that unequal 
speeds of stock and wire produced a defective paper 
product under high machine speeds. Id. The 
variance in paper speed created disturbances and 
ripples some ten feet from the discharge. Id. With 
the problem defined, Eibel easily prescribed the 
solution by elevating one end of the paper feed to 
equalize the speeds of the wire and the paper stock 
by gravity. Id. at 64, 43 S.Ct. 322. 

In this case, Chapman discovered that the salting 
of stereoisomer 8á, not the oxidation of 
thebaine, created the additional 14-hydroxy impurity 
in oxycodone salt. He solved this problem by 
isolating and hydrogenating the 14-hydroxy to form 
additional oxycodone. Chapman's invention was not 
the mere use of a known technique to remedy a 
known source of trouble, but was, as Chief Justice 
Taft stated, “the discovery of the source not before 
known and the application of the remedy” for

which he seeks reward of the grant of a patent. Id. 
at 68, 43 S.Ct. 322. 

**5 Similarly, in In re Conover, Conover discovered 
a solution to the problem of connecting a 
rod to an outboard motor engine containing compact, 
anti-friction roller bearings. 49 C.C.P.A. 
1205, 304 F.2d 680, 681 (1962). A phenomenon 
known as “galling” could destroy the bearings at 
unpredictable times by heating of the roller elements. 
Id. at 681-82. To overcome this “galling,” 
Conover put a non-galling material, such as silver, 
on the end faces of the connecting rod bearings. Id. 
at 682. Citing the rationale of Eibel, the Court of 
Customs and Patent Appeals (“CCPA”) found that 
the differences between Conover's patent application 
and the prior art were such that “the subject 
matter as a whole,” i.e., (a) “the discovery of the 
cause of the bearing failures” and (b) “its elimination 
by the claimed plating of ... the contacting 
areas of the face portions of the connecting rods 
and the crank cheeks, were not obvious from the 
prior art at the time the invention was made to a 
person having ordinary skill in this art.” Id. at 684. 

*299 In In re Sponnoble, the pharmaceutical 
industry faced the problem of unwanted moisture 
leakage between liquid and solid compartments in 
vials. 56 C.C.P.A. 823, 405 F.2d 578, 586 (1969). 
Sponnoble discovered that the cause of this leakage 
was the passage of moisture through, rather than 
around, the center plug of the vial. Id. He solved 
the problem by fabricating a center seal plug of 
butyl rubber with a silicone coating. Id. The CCPA 
found, “a patentable invention may lie in the discovery 
of the source of a problem even though the 
remedy may be obvious once the source of the 
problem is identified. This is part of the ‘subject 
matter as a whole’ which should always be considered 
in determining the obviousness of an invention 
under 35 USC 103.” Id. at 585. In resolving the 
issue of obviousness, the court stated, “The crux of 
the matter ... is the discovery by appellant that passage 
through the center plug was a major cause of 
moisture transmission.” Id. at 586. The court 

reasoned that “[t]he question here is whether the 
prior art recognized the cause of the problem,” 
which it did not. Id. 

The CCPA in In re Peehs found that Peehs had 
represented to the Patent and Trademark Office that 
up until the time of the claimed invention, “the nuclear 
[power] industry faced the problem of undesirable 
stressing of fuel rod claddings in gas-cooled 
nuclear reactors.” 612 F.2d 1287, 1290 
(C.C.P.A.1980). Peehs discovered that “the cause 
of this stressing was sticking between the metal surfaces 
of the claddings and the contact elements of 
the spacer grids.” Id. He solved this problem by 
“roughening one of the contact surfaces.” Id. Thus, 
as in Eibel, Conover, and Sponnoble, “the crux of 
the matter is the discovery by appellants of the 
cause of a problem, and the determinative question 
is whether that cause would have been recognized 
by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention 
was made.” Id. 

**6 In reversing the Board's holding of obviousness, 
the CCPA found “no support for the conclusion 
that those of ordinary skill in the art would 
have recognized that sticking between the fuel rod 
claddings and the spacer grid contact elements 
caused the stressing of the claddings.” Id. The court 
also found that “ ‘[where] there is no evidence of 
record that a person of ordinary skill in the art at 
the time of [an applicant's] invention would have 
expected [a problem]’, e.g., sticking, ‘to exist at all, 
it is not proper to conclude that [an invention]’, 
e.g., roughening one of the contact surfaces, ‘which 
solves this problem, ... would have been obvious to 
that hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art.’ 
” Id. (citing In re Nomiya, 509 F.2d 566, 572 
(C.C.P.A.1975)). 

The Supreme Court in KSR International Co. v. 
Teleflex Inc. recently held that “[w]hen there is a 
design need or market pressure to solve a problem 
and there are a finite number of identified, predictable 
solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good 
reason to pursue the known options within his or 
her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated

(Cite as: 315 Fed.Appx. 294, 2009 WL 606065 (C.A.Fed.)) 

success, it is likely the product not of innovation 
but of ordinary skill and common sense.” 550 U.S. 
398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 1742, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). 
This case, as are Eibel, Conover, Sponnoble, and 
Peehs, is distinguished from KSR because there 
were no “finite number of identified, predictable 
solutions” that were used to discover the source of 
and solution to the problems. Id. No persons of ordinary 
skill in the art knew of the existence of 8á 
before Chapman and, in fact, were trying to solve 
the problem of removing excess 14-hydroxy impurities 
from oxycodone salt by other means. Because 
no other persons had discovered and solved this 
problem as *300 Chapman did, his invention is the 
product of innovation and not of “ordinary skill and 
common sense.” Id. 

Following KSR, this court in 2008 in Ortho-
McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Mylan Laboratories, 
Inc., found an invention worthy of a patent 
when a researcher in his search for a new antidiabetic 
drug, accidentally discovered topiramate. 520 
F.3d 1358 (Fed.Cir.2008). Topiramate is a reaction 
intermediate that has powerful anticonvulsant properties 
marketed by Ortho-McNeil as TOPOMAX® 
for the treatment of epilepsy. Id. at 1360. This court 
attached particular importance to the objective criteria 
of nonobviousness, including the powerful, 
unexpected results of topiramate (i.e., anticonvulsive 
activity), skepticism of experts, copying, and 
commercial success. Id. at 1365. “As this court has 
repeatedly explained, this evidence is not just a cumulative 
or confirmatory part of the obviousness 
calculus but constitutes independent evidence of 
nonobviousness.” Id. (citing Catalina Lighting, Inc. 

v. Lamps Plus, Inc., 295 F.3d 1277, 1288 
(Fed.Cir.2002) (“Objective indicia may often be the 
most probative and cogent evidence of nonobviousness 
in the record.”)). 
**7 Chapman unexpectedly discovered that the 
stereoisomer 8á, when salted, creates additional 
14-hydroxy. This additional 14-hydroxy can be 
isolated and hydrogenated to create additional oxycodone, 
containing much less of the 14-hydroxy 

impurities that the FDA desired removed from oxycodone 
salt. Persons of ordinary skill in the art never 
discovered or appreciated the presence of 8á as 
the source of the additional 14-hydroxy. The prior 
art disclosed that 14-hydroxy was a carry-over from 
the oxidation of thebaine, resulting in leftover, unreacted 
14-hydroxy in the oxycodone salt. “[T]he 
challenges of this inventive process would have 
prevented one of ordinary skill in this art from traversing 
the multiple obstacles to easily produce the 
invention in light of the evidence available at the 
time of invention.” Ortho-McNeil, 520 F.3d at 
1365. Chapman, therefore, unexpectedly discovered 
the true source of the additional 14-hydroxy and 
solved the problem by removing the impurity from 
oxycodone salt. Because the prior art could not 
have intended or appreciated Chapman's discovery 
or solution, this invention deserves patent protection. 


For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Southern District of Indiana extended the statutory 
thirty-month stay of 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) 
(2003), preventing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(“FDA”) from finally approving Teva's 
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). Eli

1:06-cv-1017, 2008 WL 4809963, at *4-5 (S.D.Ind. 
Dec.29, 2008) (“ Extension Order ”). Because 
*1348 the trial court did not abuse its discretion, 
this court affirms. 

I 

This case arises under the Drug Price Competition 
and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 
Pub.L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984) (codified 
at 21 U.S.C. §§ 355, 360cc (2003); 35 U.S.C. §§ 
156 (2002), 271 (2003)) (collectively, the 
“Hatch-Waxman Act”). Plaintiff-Appellee Eli Lilly 
& Company (“Lilly”) sued Teva for patent infringement 
under 35 U.S.C. § 1 et. seq. and 28 U.S.C. §§ 
2201-02. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act strikes a balance 
between the sometimes-competing policy interests 
of inducing pioneering research and development of 
new drugs and enabling production of low-cost, 
generic copies of those drugs. A manufacturer that 
seeks to market a generic drug may submit an ANDA 
for approval by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (“FDA”), rather than submitting 
a full New Drug Application (“NDA”) showing 
the safety and efficacy of the generic drug. Thus, 
the generic manufacturer may rely on safety and efficacy 
studies of the pioneer manufacturer upon 
showing the generic drug's bioequivalence with the 
previously approved drug product. 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(2)(A) (2003). 

The Hatch-Waxman Act also requires a pioneer 
drug manufacturer to notify the FDA of all patents 
that “claim[ ] the drug for which the [NDA] applicant 
submitted the application.” 21 U.S.C. §§ 
355(b)(1) & (c)(2) (2003). The FDA lists such patents 
in its Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic 
Equivalence Evaluations, known as the 
“Orange Book”. Under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2), a 

generic manufacturer infringes a patent by filing an 
ANDA to obtain approval for a generic drug 
product claimed by a valid and unexpired patent. 

As part of the approval process, an ANDA applicant 
must make a certification addressing each 
patent listed in the Orange Book that claims the 
drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii). The Hatch-
Waxman Act specifies the certification alternatives, 

(I) no such patent information has been submitted 
to the FDA; (II) the patent has expired; (III) the 
patent is set to expire on a certain date; or (IV) the 
patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the 
manufacture, use, or sale of the new generic drug 
for which the ANDA is submitted. 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I-IV) (2003). These are commonly 
referred to as paragraph I, II, III, and IV certifications. 
When an ANDA certifies under paragraph IV, 
the applicant must provide the patentee a detailed 
basis for its belief that the patent is not infringed, 
that it is invalid, or that it is unenforceable. 21 

U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B) (2003). The patentee then has 
forty-five days to sue the ANDA applicant for patent 
infringement. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). If 
the patentee does not sue, the FDA may proceed to 
approve the ANDA. If the patentee does file suit, 
the FDA may not approve the ANDA until expiration 
of the patent, resolution of the suit, or thirty 
months after the patentee's receipt of notice, 
whichever is earlier. Id. The court entertaining the 
suit has discretion under the statute to order a shorter 
or longer stay if “either party to the action fail[s] 
to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.” 
Id. 

In this case, Lilly holds the approved NDA for 
raloxifene hydrochloride (“ raloxifene ”) tablets. 
This product is marketed under the brand name Evista
® for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis. Lilly lists twelve patents that 
claim Evista® in the Orange Book. 

Teva filed an ANDA with the FDA in early 
2006, seeking approval to manufacture and market

generic raloxifene. As part of its ANDA, Teva filed 
paragraph IV *1349 certifications. On May 16, 
2006, Teva notified Lilly of its paragraph IV certifications. 


Lilly sued Teva on June 29, 2006, alleging that 
Teva's ANDA infringed four method patents of its 
twelve listed Orange Book patents for using raloxifene 
to prevent or treat postmenopausal osteoporosis: 
U.S. Patent Nos. RE38, 968 (“the '968 patent”), 
RE39,049 (“the '049 patent”), RE39,050 
(“the ' 050 patent”), and 6,906,086 (“the '086 patent”). 
The FDA then stayed approval of Teva's ANDA 
for thirty months, from the date that Lilly received 
Teva's paragraph IV notifications, expiring 
on November 16, 2008. Extension Order, 2008 WL 
4809963 at *1. 

On September 25, 2006, the district court 
entered a scheduling order, setting a trial date of 
March 9, 2009-four months after expiration of the 
thirty-month statutory stay. In February 2007, Lilly 
amended its complaint to assert that Teva infringed 
three additional Evista ® patents-U.S. Patent Nos. 
6,458,811 (“the '811 patent”), 6,797,719 (“the '719 
patent”), and 6,894,064 (“the '064 patent”)covering 
raloxifene particle size and formulation. 

On July 8, 2008, Teva amended its ANDA to 
include a new particle-size measuring methodology 
for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in its proposed 
raloxifene tablets. Extension Order, 2008 
WL 4809963 at *2. Teva disclosed this amendment 
to Lilly on July 10, 2008, and provided it three 
batch samples on July 28, August 19, and September 
17, 2008. The district court, however, previously 
set a discovery deadline of August 18, 2008. 
Id. at *4 n. 2. By September 5, 2008, Teva also 
provided Lilly with 27,000 pages of related documentation. 
Moreover, the district court ordered 
Teva to produce additional raloxifene samples to 
Lilly by December 15, 2008, in response to Lilly's 
motion to compel discovery. 

On September 17, 2008, Lilly moved the district 
court under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) to ex


tend the statutory thirty-month stay due to Teva's 
alleged discovery violations, prejudicing Lilly's 
preparations for trial. Extension Order, 2008 WL 
4809963 at *1. Lilly alleged that Teva “fail[ed] to 
‘reasonably cooperate in expediting the action’ ... 
as evidenced by Teva's last-minute alteration of its 
proposed drug product and its ‘multiple delays in 
producing critical discovery ... [which have] adversely 
affected Lilly's infringement case and trial 
preparation.’ ” Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963 
at *2 (citing Lilly Mot. for Ext. of Stat. Stay at I-2) 
(second alteration in the original). Lilly also alleged 
that Teva prejudiced its preparations for trial by not 
timely disclosing its plans to alter the particle-size 
measuring methodology of its proposed raloxifene 
tablets. Id. Teva allegedly began changing its 
particle-size measuring methodology as early as 
November 2007 with the goal of avoiding infringement 
of Lilly's asserted patents. 

On October 6, 2008, Lilly moved the district 
court for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) 
and preliminary injunction to prevent Teva from 
launching its product on November 16, 2008, after 
expiration of the statutory thirty-month stay. The 
court granted Lilly's motion on October 29, 2008, 
to extend the statutory thirty-month stay until the 
beginning of trial on March 9, 2009. Extension Order, 
2008 WL 4809963 at *6. Lilly's motions for a 
TRO and preliminary injunction were thus denied 
as moot. Id. at *6 n. 5. 

[1] Given the urgency of Teva's situation, just 
weeks before trial, it filed a motion in this court for 
an expedited appeal from the district court's order. 
Because the district court continued the injunction 
against the FDA, preventing it from finally approving 
Teva's ANDA until March 9, 2009, this court 
has jurisdiction *1350 over this appeal under 28 
U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). 
II 

The standard of review in this case is abuse of 
discretion in both the United States Courts of Appeals 
for the Federal and Seventh Circuits. See

F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“We review a 
denial of a request for additional discovery for abuse

492, 495 (7th Cir.1996) ( “[W]e review a district 
court's discovery determinations for an abuse of 
discretion.”). Therefore, this court need not decide 
the question of which jurisdiction's law applies and 
will apply an abuse of discretion standard to its 
analysis. 

[2][3] “A district court would necessarily abuse 
its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous 
view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment 
of the evidence.” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx 
Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 
L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). While extending the thirty-
month statutory stay, the district court found, 

In light of the fact that Teva has recast its product 
more than eighteen months after it provided the 
original sample to Lilly and only eight months 
before trial is set to commence, we find that, in 
preparation for trial, Lilly is entitled to have sufficient 
opportunity to identify the nature and 
composition of the raloxifene product as Teva intends 
for it to be sold. 

Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963 at *4-5. In 
making this determination, the record contained 
sufficient evidence, not based on clearly erroneous 
factual findings, upon which the district court rationally 
based its decision. The court relied on the 
evidence in the record that Teva altered its proposed 
generic raloxifene hydrochloride tablets late 
in the litigation. Specifically, Teva changed the 
particle size manufacturing specification of its active 
pharmaceutical ingredient and the method of 
measuring the particle size. Id. at *2. Teva then delivered 
its changed samples to Lilly past the court's 
August 18, 2008, discovery deadline. 

[4] In making these findings, the district court 
acted within its discretion in this area. 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) grants district courts the discretion 
to adjust the statutory thirty-month stay of ANDAs 
if “either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate 
in expediting the action.” Trial courts, thus, 
may shorten or extend the thirty-month statutory 
period based on the parties' uncooperative discovery 
practices before the court. Allergan, Inc. v. Al-
con Labs., Inc., 324 F.3d 1322, 1337 n. 5 
(Fed.Cir.2003) (Schall, J., concurring). 

In explaining the statutory language, the House 
Committee report specified, “[f]ailure by either 
party to cooperate in a reasonable manner may be 
used by the court to reduce or lengthen the time, as 
appropriate, before an ANDA approval becomes effective.” 
H.R.Rep. No. 98-857, at 16 (1984), as reprinted 
in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2686, 2700. Because 
Teva provided Lilly with its altered raloxifene 
samples just eight months before trial, the district 
court extended the stay “to provide Lilly with a 
reasonable amount of time to allow its expert to test 
and report on the altered raloxifene samples 
provided by Teva and for Lilly to assess and utilize 
that information and analysis in preparation for trial.” 
Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963 at *6. 

Teva argues that this court's opinion in Andrx 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Biovail Corporation, 276 
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.2002), shows that the district 
court erred in extending the thirty-month stay. In 
Andrx, Biovail and Andrx were embroiled in patent 
litigation over both infringement and *1351 validity. 
Id. at 1372. The filing of the action triggered an 
automatic thirty-month stay of Andrx's ANDA from 
the date Biovail received Andrx's paragraph IV certifications 
on February 20, 2001. Id. Before the expiration 
of the thirty-month stay, Biovail acquired 
an exclusive license to a second patent in January 
2001 that allegedly claimed the subject matter of its 
NDA. Id. Biovail changed its manufacturing process 
to fall within the claims of the second patent, 
which it submitted to the FDA on January 8, 2001, 
for listing in the Orange Book. Id. at 1372-73. In a 
February 2, 2001, letter to Andrx, the FDA stated 
that because of the listing of Biovail's second patent, 
it no longer intended to approve Andrx's ANDA 
upon the expiration of the thirty-month stay. Id. 
at 1372.

Andrx filed paragraph IV certifications with 
the FDA on February 16, 2001, that it did not infringe 
the second patent and that the patent was invalid. 
Andrx, 276 F.3d at 1373. On April 5, 2001, 
forty-four days after it received the paragraph IV 
certifications on February 20, 2001, Biovail filed a 
second suit against Andrx under 35 U.S.C. § 
271(e)(2) for infringement of the second patent. Id. 
The second suit triggered a second thirty-month 

FN*

statutory stay ending August 8, 2003.Id. 

FN* In June 2003, the FDA amended its 
regulations so that an NDA holder could 
not obtain additional thirty-month stays 
based on patents added to the Orange Book 
after a generic manufacturer filed its ANDA. 
See Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 
F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2003); Robert A. 
Matthews, Jr., Annotated Patent Digest § 

10:154 (2007). In late 2003, Congress 
amended 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) to 
eliminate the thirty-month stay for any patent 
the NDA holder acquired after the generic 
manufacturer filed its ANDA. Pub.L. 
No. 108-173, § 1101(a)(2)(A)(ii), 117 Stat. 
2448 (2003). 
Andrx moved for summary judgment under 21 

U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) that the district court 
shorten the second thirty-month stay. Id. at 1374. In 
granting the motion, the district court found Biovail 
had intentionally impeded and delayed the expeditious 
resolution of the patent actions between it and 
Andrx. Id. at 1374-75. The district court, thus, 
shortened the second statutory thirty-month stay to 
September 27, 2001. Id. at 1375. 
On appeal, this court held that the district court 
exceeded its authority under 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(5)(B)(iii), vacated the district court's order, 
and remanded for further proceedings. Andrx, 276 
F.3d at 1370. This court found the district court's 
reading of the statute was overly broad. The district 
court concluded it could shorten the thirty-month 
stay due to the alleged delay in the resolution of 
both patent disputes between the parties. Id. at 

1376. The district court, however, erred by basing 
its decision on Biovail's positions before the FDA. 

Id. 

Unlike Andrx, in this case, the district court extended 
the statutory thirty-month stay based on its 
findings of Teva's lack of cooperation in expediting 
the patent litigation in its court. The court's findings 
were not based on Teva's filing with the FDA. 
Moreover, as discussed, the district court's decision 
was supported by the record, its factual findings, 
and proper application of the law. 

III 

Because the district court did not abuse its discretion 
with its discovery findings and extending 
the statutory thirty-month stay to March 9, 2009, 
this court affirms. Given the short timing of this appeal, 
under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40, 
a petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc 
must be filed within seven days after entry of judgment. 


AFFIRMED. 

*1352 PROST, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

The thirty-month stay described in 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) may be extended for one reason 
and one reason only: “because either party to the 
action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting 
the action.” Because I believe that the majority misapplies 
the law and misapprehends the facts in affirming 
the district court, I respectfully dissent. 

I 

The question here is one of statutory construction, 
which we review de novo. Although the majority 
is correct in that a district court's decision to 
issue a stay is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion, 
see, e.g., Cherokee Nation v. United States, 
124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed.Cir.1997), the power to 
issue a stay in most cases arises under district 
courts' “broad discretionary powers to control their 
dockets,” Gould v. Control Laser Corp., 705 F.2d 
1340, 1341 (Fed.Cir.1983). Where, as here, the stay 
is explicitly tied to a statutory standard, that stand

ard must be properly construed. See In re Princo 
Corp., 478 F.3d 1345, 1353-55 (Fed.Cir.2007) 

(construing a statute that requires a stay by reference 
to dictionaries and legislative history, among 
other things). In the past, we have recognized that 
interpretation of the stay provided in 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) is a question of law reviewed 
without deference. Andrx Pharm., Inc. v. Biovail 
Corp., 276 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2002). In Andrx, 
Biovail appealed a district court's decision to 
grant partial summary judgment, shortening the 
thirty-month stay and requiring the Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) to approve Andrx's Abbreviated 
New Drug Application (“ANDA”). We 
stated that “[i]nterpretation of statutes governing 
the grant of summary judgment presents threshold 
questions of law that are reviewed without deference,” 
then proceeded to do just that, ultimately vacating 
and remanding. Id. 

But even under an abuse of discretion standard, 
the district court's decision should not stand. Let us 
be clear about what the district court “found.” The 
district court never made any finding related to the 
statutory standard, i.e., whether Teva reasonably 
cooperated in expediting the action. The court 
briefly described the background of the case and 
the parties' relative positions, and noted that the 
magistrate judge had ordered Teva to produce various 
documents prior to August 18, 2008. Although 
Teva did not complete production until September 
5, 2008, the court did not purport to base any finding 
that Teva “failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting 
the action” on this eighteen-day delay. Instead, 
the court's findings were limited to the following: 


As this Court observed in its order granting a 
limited extension of the statutory stay in Eli Lilly 
& Co. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., it appears 
“important, perhaps essential, that the composition 
of the generic drug product for which FDA 
approval is being sought ... and which Lilly alleges 
to be the infringing product should be 
definitively established.” That proposition simil


arly applies here. In light of the fact that Teva has 
recast its product more than eighteen months 
after it provided the original sample to Lilly and 
only eight months before trial is set to commence, 
we find that, in preparation for trial, Lilly 
is entitled to have a sufficient opportunity to 
identify the nature and composition of the raloxifene 
product as Teva intends for it to be sold. 

Teva argues that the circumstances in [Barr ] 
are distinguishable from the situation at hand because 
the defendant in Barr had failed to provide 
Lilly with even one sample of its generic drug 
product, whereas here, on December 12, 2006, 
Teva provided Lilly with its original raloxifene 
sample, and has since produced*1353 to Lilly 
three samples of the altered product (the first on 
July 28, 2008, the second on August 19, 2008, 
and the third on September 17, 2008). Therefore, 
Teva contends that an extension of the statutory 
stay here is unnecessary because it has fully disclosed 
all the required information to Lilly in an 
expeditious fashion. Although Teva correctly 
cites the factual differences between the case at 
bar and the situation in Barr, those differences 
are not viewed by us as determinative on this issue. 
In Barr, we did not simply extend the statutory 
stay through the date on which the defendant 
produced a sample of its product to Lilly. Instead, 
our order provided that, after the defendant 
produced the sample, the stay would extend 
through “a reasonably expeditious time period for 
preparing for trial.” 

A similar extension is warranted here in order 
to provide Lilly with a reasonable amount of time 
to allow its expert to test and report on the altered 
raloxifene samples provided by Teva and for 
Lilly to assess and utilize that information and 
analysis in preparation for trial, which is set to 
commence on March 9, 2009. For the foregoing 
reasons, the Court hereby EXTENDS until March 
9, 2009, in this action the period under 21 U.S.C. 
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) during which the FDA is 
barred from approving ANDA No. 78-193.

Eli Lilly & Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., No. 
1:06-CV-1017, 2008 WL 4809963, at *2 (S.D.Ind. 
Oct. 29, 2008) (citations and footnotes omitted) (“ 
Order Extending Stay ”). Not once in this order did 
the court indicate, much less unambiguously state, 
that it found Teva had failed to reasonably cooper


FN1

ate in expediting the action.The court provided 
at most two justifications for extending the stay: (1) 
to provide Lilly “a sufficient opportunity to identify 
the nature and composition of the raloxifene 
product as Teva intends for it to be sold,” and (2) to 
give Lilly “a reasonable amount of time to allow its 
expert to test and report on the altered raloxifene 
samples provided by Teva and for Lilly to assess 
and utilize that information and analysis in preparation 
for trial.” Id. Neither of these reasons remotely 
resembles the statutorily required finding. 

FN1. If anything, statements by the district 
court suggest that the court agreed that 
Teva reasonably cooperated by expeditiously 
“disclosing all of the required information,” 
but extended the stay regardless. 
Order Extending Stay, 2008 WL 
4809963, at *2. Specifically, Teva claimed 
that an extension of the stay was unnecessary 
because it fully disclosed all of the required 
information in an expeditious fashion. 
The court stated that “[a]lthough Teva 
correctly cite[d] the factual differences 
between the case at bar and the situation in 
Barr, those differences are not ... determinative 
on this issue.” Id. (emphasis added). 

It is clear from the record, in my view, that the 
district court never related Teva's conduct to the 
statutory standard. But even if the court had made a 
conclusory statement regarding Teva's cooperation, 
that alone would not suffice. In Gechter v. Davidson, 
we clarified that although “we review decisions, 
not opinions,” a district court opinion 
“must contain sufficient findings and reasoning to 
permit meaningful appellate scrutiny.” 116 F.3d 
1454, 1458 (Fed.Cir.1997). We went on to state the 
following: 

A district court therefore may not merely state its 
findings in conclusory terms, but must provide 
sufficient detail to elucidate the reasoning by 
which the court reached its ultimate finding on an 
issue of fact or conclusion on an issue of law; 
otherwise, the appellate court is unable to carry 
out its appellate review function. Indeed, as to the 
facts it must also find subsidiary facts 
“specially,” and not just the ultimate fact, here of 
anticipation.*1354 If it fails to do so, its decision 
will ordinarily be vacated. 

Id. In fact, in Nazomi Communications, Inc. v. 
Arm Holdings, PLC, our court vacated a district 
court's claim construction, an issue that we examine 
de novo, stating, 

This court's review of a district court's claim 
construction, albeit without deference, nonetheless 
is not an independent analysis in the first instance. 
Moreover, in order to perform such a review, 
this court must be furnished “sufficient 
findings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate 
scrutiny.” This requirement for sufficient 
reasoning applies with equal force to issues of 
law, such as claim construction, and issues of 
fact, such as infringement. 

... Unlike Gechter and Graco, where the records 
were devoid of any claim construction analysis, 
the district court in this case provided some 
claim construction analysis. Nonetheless this analysis 
is inadequate because it does not supply the 
basis for its reasoning sufficient for a meaningful 
review. 

403 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing 
Gechter, 116 F.3d at 1458; Graco, Inc. v. Binks 
Mfg., 60 F.3d 785, 791 (Fed.Cir.1995)) (citations 
omitted). As in Nazomi, the district court here did 
not provide sufficient findings and reasoning to 
permit meaningful appellate scrutiny. Thus, regardless 
of whether we review the district court's order 
de novo or for an abuse of discretion, the order 
should be vacated.

The consequences of the majority opinion are 
of particular importance here. Rarely have district 
courts had the opportunity to address the circumstances 
under which the thirty-month stay may be 

FN2

extended or shortened. Those courts that have 
addressed the issue have recognized the statutory 
standard and strictly abided by it in determining 
whether to modify the stay. See Zeneca Ltd. v. 
Pharmachemie B.V., 16 F.Supp.2d 112 
(D.Mass.1998); In re Brimonidine Patent Litig., 
No. 07-md-1866, 2008 WL 4809037 (D.Del.

Zenith Goldline Pharm., Inc., No. 
IP99-0038-C-H/G, 2001 WL 238090 (S.D.Ind. 
Mar.8, 2001). 
FN2. Even commentators have noted that 

“[s]tatutory stay adjustments have not been 

frequent.” Gerald Sobel et al., Hatch-

Waxman Litigation from the Perspective of 

Pioneer Pharmaceutical Companies, in 

Patent Litigation Strategies Handbook 

183, 196-97 (Barry L. Grossman & Gary 

M. Hoffman eds., 2d ed.2005). 
Appropriate findings by the district court are 
especially important where, as here, Congress set 
forth a clear statutory timeframe and provided one 

FN3

narrow exception to the general rule.Only once 
has this court examined the matter directly. In Andrx, 
we analyzed a single question: *1355 whether 
the district court had the authority to shorten the 
stay period based on one party's conduct before the 
FDA. 276 F.3d at 1376. We expressly limited our 
review, declining to reach the question “whether 
the district court's authority to shorten the thirty-
month statutory stay is limited to those cases in 
which there was a failure to expedite the infringement 
action once it is filed or whether the authority 
extends as well to situations in which the infringement 
action was not commenced expeditiously.” Id. 

In short, this court has not previously provided any 
guidance to the district courts as to what qualifies 
as a “fail[ure] to reasonably cooperate in expediting 
the action.” To affirm in this case is to effectively 
eliminate the statutorily required finding, and to 
prematurely terminate the development of appropriate 
standards governing modification under 21 

U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). 
FN3. The legislative history indicates that 
the thirty-month stay was a hard-won compromise 
between brand-name manufacturers, 
generics manufacturers, and other 
stakeholders. The length of the stay was 
the subject of heated debate in the House. 
130 Cong. Rec. H24426-31 (Sept. 6, 
1984). Initially, the House version of the 
bill provided for a stay of just eighteen 
months. H.R. 3605, 98th Cong. § 101 (as 
reported by H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 
Aug. 1, 1984). The Senate version, which 
ultimately prevailed, described a thirty-
month stay. S. 2926, 98th Cong. § 101 
(1984). In light of this fact, we should be 
especially careful when reviewing district 
courts' decisions to modify the statutory 
period. That period ceases to have meaning 
when district courts are able to modify the 
stay without articulating why the narrow 
circumstances described in the statute are 
present. 

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Background: Owners of patent covering pharmaceutical 
product clopidogrel bisulfate brought infringement 
action against competitors and competitors 
counterclaimed that the patent was invalid 
and unenforceable. The United States District Court 
for the Southern District of New York, Sidney H.

that the patent was valid and enforceable. Competitors 
appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) prior art patents did not anticipate patent, and 
(2) district court did not clearly err in making finding 
of nonobviousness.

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge. 

This suit arose in accordance with the provisions 
of the Hatch-Waxman Act, codified at 35 

U.S.C. § 271(e) and 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). The patent 
at issue is United States Patent No. 4,847,265 (the 
'265 patent), owned by Sanofi-Synthelabo and related 
companies (collectively “Sanofi”), and covers 
the pharmaceutical product having the common 
name clopidogrel bisulfate and the brand name 
Plavix®. The product has the property of inhibiting 
the aggregation of blood platelets, and is used to 
treat or prevent blood-thrombotic events such as 
heart attacks and strokes. We affirm the district 
court's ruling sustaining patent validity. 
BACKGROUND 

Clopidogrel is the common name of the dextrorotatory 
isomer of the chemical compound 
named methyl alpha-
5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlorop 
henyl)-acetate. Claim 3 of the patent is in suit: 

3. Hydrogen sulfate of the dextro-rotatory isomer 
of methyl alpha-
5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlor 
ophenyl)-acetate substantially separated from the 
levo-rotatory isomer. 
The '265 patent was issued on July 11, 1989, 
with priority from an application first filed in 
France in 1987. Approval of the product by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
was received in 1998. 

*1078 Apotex, Inc. filed an Abbreviated New 

FN1

Drug Application (ANDA) in November 2001 
for FDA approval to sell clopidogrel bisulfate, stating, 
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), 
that it believed the '265 patent to be invalid. Such 
“paragraph IV certification” is defined as an act of 
infringement for litigation purposes, 35 U.S.C. § 
271(e), in order to facilitate pre-marketing legal 
challenge by the producer of a generic form of a 

patented pharmaceutical product. In accordance 
with the statutory procedures Sanofi duly filed suit 
for infringement, and Apotex counterclaimed that 
the '265 patent is invalid on several grounds and 
unenforceable. The suit initiated a thirty-month stay 
of FDA approval of Apotex's ANDA, as provided 
by 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). A proposed settlement 
was not achieved, the statutory stay expired, 
the FDA approved the Apotex ANDA, and Apotex 
commenced sale of its generic clopidogrel bisulfate 
product on August 8, 2006. Sanofi then moved in 
the district court for a preliminary injunction, asking 
that Apotex be enjoined from marketing its infringing 
product while the litigation was pending, 
noting that infringement was conceded by Apotex. 

FN1. Federal approval of a generic counterpart 
of a previously approved drug pursuant 
to an ANDA requires showing that 
the generic product is the same as the approved 
product; evidence of safety and efficacy 
of the generic product is not required. 
See 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(j)(2)(A) and 
355(b)(1). 

The district court found that Sanofi was likely 
to succeed on the merits of the validity and enforceability 
of the '265 patent, and that the equitable 
factors of the balance of harms, the probability of 
irreparable harm, and the various public interests, 
favored granting the injunction. Sanofi-Synthelabo 

v. Apotex Inc., 488 F.Supp.2d 317, 350 
(S.D.N.Y.2006) (“ Sanofi I ”). This court affirmed 
the district court's rulings, while explaining that the 
record on the substantive issues was necessarily incomplete 
and that the district court could review all 
aspects at trial. See Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex 
Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1374-84 (Fed.Cir.2006) (“ 
Sanofi II ”) (holding that the patentee was likely to 
succeed on the merits, and that the balance of hardships 
and public interest supported the injunction). 
A bench trial was held from January 22 to February 
15, 2007, following which the district court ruled 
that the '265 patent is valid and enforceable. Sanofi-
Synthelabo v. Apotex Inc., 492 F.Supp.2d 353, 397

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

(S.D.N.Y.2007) (“ Sanofi III ”). 

This appeal is focused on the question of patentability 
of this dextrorotatory isomer in view of its 
known racemate described in earlier Sanofi patents, 
specifically, Sanofi's United States Patent No. 
4,529,596 (the '596 patent) and Canadian Patent 
No. 1,194,875 (the '875 patent). Both reference patents 
are derived from the same French priority filing 
and are prior art against the '265 patent. 

The activities that led to the product in suit are discussed 
in the earlier opinions, and are summarized 
as relevant herein: In 1972 Sanofi scientists were 
seeking products that might have improved anti-
inflammatory properties, and in the course of this 
work discovered that certain compounds of the 

class known as thienopyridines (compounds having 
a thiene ring fused to a pyridine ring) have the 
property of inhibiting blood platelet aggregation. 
Sanofi scientists, led by Dr. Jean-Pierre Maffrand, 
pursued this direction of research. The record states 
that they initially synthesized and evaluated several 
hundred chemical modifications and derivatives of 
thienopyridines, seeking optimum anti-platelet aggregation 
properties with *1079 minimal undesirable 
effects. They eventually selected for development 
the compound having the following structural 
formula: 


Sanofi gave this compound the common name “ 
ticlopidine.” After lengthy development, including 
animal and human trials, in 1991 ticlopidine was 
approved in the United States for use as an anti-
thrombotic agent. This approval, however, was accompanied 
by required warnings concerning possible 
adverse effects, for reports had been received 
of rarely occurring but serious blood disorders, 
neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 
associated with prolonged usage of ticlopidine 
. Thus Sanofi continued its search for a product that 
would have the therapeutic benefits of ticlopidine 
but without the adverse properties. 

Sanofi synthesized and evaluated several hundred 
additional thienopyridine derivatives, including a 
class of compounds having the following general 
structure, wherein one of the hydrogen atoms on the 
bridge carbon atom (marked with an asterisk), is replaced 
with an ester, carboxylic acid, or amide 
group. This class is the subject of the '596 patent 
(and the counterpart Canadian ' 875 patent), and is 
shown as follows:

X and Y can be any of a number of substituents, as 
identified in the patents; the district court found 
that there are thirty-seven possibilities for X and 
1710 choices for Y. The patents state that compounds 
of this class exhibit good anti-platelet aggregation 
properties and are well tolerated. Focusing 
on the ' 596 patent, the specification includes 
twenty-one examples of specific compounds, including 
a compound designated as PCR 4099, 

which Sanofi synthesized in July 1980. In PCR 
4099 the substituent attached to the bridge carbon is 
the methyl ester group (-COOCH), and X is chlor

This compound has the chemical name methyl 
alpha-5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thieno 
pyridyl)(2-chlorophenyl)-acetate, with the acronym 
MATTPCA. PCR 4099 as the hydrochloride salt 
was selected for commercial development as a potential 
replacement for ticlopidine in light of its improved 
platelet inhibition and toxicity profile. 

However, PCR 4099 still raised toxicity concerns, 
for at very high doses it caused convulsions 
in laboratory animals. Thus the research efforts 

continued, concurrently with the clinical and commercial 
development of PCR 4099. Sanofi states 
that about 1500 compounds in this general class 
were synthesized, of which about 600, including 
PCR 4099, were chiral thienopyridines. “Chiral” is 
defined as “describ[ing] asymmetric molecules that 
are mirror images of each other, i.e., they are related 
like right and left hands. Such molecules are 
also called enantiomers and are characterized by 
optical activity.” Richard J. Lewis, Sr., Hawley's 
Condensed Chemical Dictionary 270 (15th 
ed.2007).

Enantiomers are spatial isomers, also called 
stereoisomers, wherein the isomeric compounds 
have the same chemical formula and the same 
chemical structure, but differ in their orientation in 
three-dimensional space. Such stereoisomers can 
exist for all molecules that contain an asymmetric 
carbon atom. An “asymmetric carbon” is a carbon 
atom to which four different substituents are attached, 
whereby, due to the tetrahedral structure of 
carbon bonds in three dimensions, the spatial orientation 
of substituents attached to a carbon atom 
varies. When there is only one asymmetric carbon 
atom in the molecule and thus only two stereoisomers, 
these isomers are called enantiomers. 

Enantiomers are identified and distinguished by 
their optical characteristics when a purified solution 
of the separated isomers is exposed to plane-polarized 
light. One enantiomer will rotate plane-
polarized light to the right (and thus is called the 
dextrorotatory or d-or (+) isomer), and the other 
rotates plane-polarized light to the left (called the 
levorotatory or l-or (-) isomer). For the compounds 
here at issue, the asymmetric carbon is at the bridge 
between the thienopyridine and the benzene components 
of the molecule, as marked with an asterisk 
in the drawings shown ante. Enantiomers generally 
are formed in equal amounts, to produce what is 
called a racemate; the racemate is optically neutral. 

In the district court, experts for both sides explained 
the difficulty of separating enantiomers, for 
they are identical except for the spatial arrangement 
at one of the carbon atoms. Sanofi scientists had 
previously separated the enantiomers of two thienopyridines, 
and had found that the separated enantiomers 
showed no advantage over the racemates. 
The first such separation was conducted in 1978 for 
a *1081 compound designated PCR 1033, which 
had a methyl group in place of one of the hydrogen 
atoms on the bridge carbon of ticlopidine, and 
whose maleate salt was found to be more potent 
than ticlopidine in antiplatelet activity but had undesirable 
side effects. On separation, it was found 
that one of the enantiomers of PCR 1033 was more 

biologically active but also more neurotoxic than 
the racemate. Thus, separation offered no benefit 
for PCR 1033. 

About three years later, Sanofi separated the 
enantiomers of a compound designated PCR 3233, 
which had an ethyl group on the bridge carbon, and 
was more effective in antiplatelet activity than 
ticlopidine. However, neither of the separated enantiomers 
differed in activity from the racemate, and 
thus separation offered no benefit for PCR 3233. 
Sanofi witnesses testified to their belief that there 
was no advantage to separation of the enantiomers 
of thienopyridines, and no other racemates were 
separated until, in November 1985, Dr. Maffrand 
decided to study the enantiomers of PCR 4099. 

The separation for PCR 4099 was assigned to 
Mr. Alain Badorc, the chemist who had separated 
the enantiomers of PCR 1033 and 3233. It was explained 
in the district court that such separations 
are complex and time-consuming, for enantiomers 
are identical except for the spatial orientation about 
one carbon atom, and tend to have identical or almost 
identical chemical and physical properties. 
The district court received testimony that although 
the chemical literature shows at least ten separation 
techniques that might be tried, it cannot be known 
in advance which, if any, technique might work. 

The record shows five months of experimentation 
by Mr. Badorc, and eventually the successful 
separation using a technique called diastereomeric 
salt formation. This procedure, which originated 
with Louis Pasteur, is based on the trial of diverse 
salt-forming compositions and conditions, in the 
hope of coming upon a lucky combination of reagents 
that will preferentially select one of the enantiomers 
and crystallize from the solution in optically 
pure form. In Mr. Badorc's successful experiment, 
he prepared thirty compositions of PCR 4099 
and various resolving acids at various concentrations 
and in various solvents, and after about one 
month crystals formed in the composition containing 
(+)camphorsulfonic acid and PCR 4099 in a 

4:10 ratio, dissolved in acetone. This combination

eventually yielded the pure levorotatory enantiomer, 
and isolation of the pure dextrorotatory enantiomer 
followed, as discussed by the district court 
in Sanofi III, 492 F.Supp.2d at 372-73. 

Sanofi then determined the biological properties 
of the enantiomers of PCR 4099, and found that 
they had the rare characteristic of “absolute stereoselectivity”: 
the dextrorotatory enantiomer 
provided all of the favorable antiplatelet activity 
but with no significant neurotoxicity, while the levorotatory 
enantiomer produced no antiplatelet 
activity but virtually all of the neurotoxicity. The 
experts for both sides agreed that while it was generally 
known that enantiomers can exhibit different 
biological activity, this degree and kind of stereoselectivity 
is rare, and could not have been predicted. 
The experts explained that in the usual case, if one 
enantiomer is more biologically active than the other, 
that activity includes the adverse as well as the 
beneficial properties. 

In view of these results, in April 1987 Sanofi 
terminated commercial development of the racemate 
PCR 4099, which had been proceeding 
since 1980 and had reached Phase I human trials at 
a cost stated to be tens of millions of dollars. More 
years of development ensued for the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer, to which Sanofi gave the common 
*1082 name “ clopidogrel.” Sanofi also found that 
the hydrochloride salt, which had been suitable for 
processing and tabletting the racemate PRC 4099, 
was not suitable for clopidogrel. After further research, 
Sanofi found that the hydrogen sulfate salt 
(also called the bisulfate) was suitable for tablet-
ting. FDA approval of clopidogrel bisulfate was 
achieved in the United States in 1998, allowing introduction 
of the product Plavix®. 

Sanofi filed a patent application directed to 
clopidogrel and certain salts and pharmaceutical 
compositions, in France on February 17, 1987 and 
then in the United States and other countries. The 
United States patent is the ' 265 patent in suit. The 
'265 specification explains that the racemate of the 
same chemical formula was described in the earlier 

French '247 patent, which corresponds to the earlier 

U.S. '596 patent. The '265 patent discusses the unusual 
stereoselectivity of the biological properties 
as between the dextrorotatory and the levorotatory 
enantiomers. The United States patent examiner, 
who had also examined the '596 patent, allowed the 
claims after requiring that the '265 claims make 
clear that the dextro and levoenantiomers are 
“substantially separated.” 
Apotex stipulated that claim 3 of the '265 patent 
is literally infringed by its product. The district 
court, after full trial including extensive expert 
testimony provided by both sides, ruled that claim 3 
is valid and enforceable. Apotex appeals the court's 
rulings on the issues of anticipation and obviousness; 
the rulings in Sanofi's favor on the issues of 
unenforceability and double patenting are not appealed. 


ANTICIPATION 

[1][2][3] Claimed subject matter is 
“anticipated” when it is not new; that is, when it 
was previously known. Invalidation on this ground 
requires that every element and limitation of the 
claim was previously described in a single prior art 
reference, either expressly or inherently, so as to 
place a person of ordinary skill in possession of the 
invention. See Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., 
Inc., 339 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2003); Continental 
Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 
1264, 1267-69 (Fed.Cir.1991). An anticipating reference 
must be enabling; that is, the description 
must be such that a person of ordinary skill in the 
field of the invention can practice the subject matter 
based on the reference, without undue experimentation. 
See Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, 
Inc., 457 F.3d 1293, 1306-07 (Fed.Cir.2006); Elan 
Pharms., Inc. v. Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. & Research, 
346 F.3d 1051, 1054 (Fed.Cir.2003). Anticipation 
is a question of fact, and the district court's 
finding of this issue is reviewed for clear error. See 
Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 347 F.3d 
1367, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2003).

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

[4] The district court identified the limitations 
stated in claim 3 of the '265 patent as (1) the bisulfate 
salt of (2) the dextrorotatory enantiomer of (3) 
the compound MATTPCA (4) substantially separated 
from the levorotatory enantiomer. The references 
on which Apotex relied were the ' 596 patent 
or its Canadian '875 counterpart. Apotex argued 
that either reference not only shows the racemate 
PCR 4099, but also its addition salts and enantiomeric 
forms. The district court discussed that these 
references show PCR 4099 only as the racemate, 
and do not show the separated enantiomer or the bi-
sulfate salt thereof. The district court found that although 
the racemate is in the prior art, the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer and salt in claim 3 of the ' 265 
patent are *1083 not described, either explicitly or 
inherently, in any reference. 
The court heard expert witnesses for both sides, 
who agreed that persons of ordinary skill in this 
field would have known that compounds that contain 
an asymmetric carbon atom have enantiomers. 
The '596 specification states: “These compounds 
having an asymmetrical carbon may exist in the 
form of two enantiomers. The invention relates 
both to each enantiomer and their mixture.” '596 
patent, col. 1, lines 39-41. However, as the witnesses 
agreed, all of the compounds in the '596 patent 
are racemates, and neither the twenty-one specific 
examples nor any other part of the specification 
shows their separation into enantiomers. The 
district court reasoned that a person of ordinary 
skill in the field of the invention would not have 
been guided to either the dextrorotatory enantiomer 
of PCR 4099 or its bisulfate salt. 

Apotex argues that the district court erred in 
law, and that it suffices that the reference shows the 
specific racemate PCR 4099 and states that the 
compounds in the reference have enantiomers and 
that the enantiomers are included in the invention. 
Apotex states that the separation of enantiomers is 
routine, even if time-consuming or requiring some 
experimentation, and thus that that the separation 
need not have been performed or described in the 

reference. Apotex states that the properties of the 
enantiomers of PCR 4099 are inherently and necessarily 
present in its known racemate, such that 
when the enantiomers are separated the previously 
observed properties are “immediately recognized” 
in one or the other enantiomer. 

Apotex stresses that the '596 patent's Example 
1 is specific to PCR 4099, and the '596 claims refer 
to “addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable 
mineral or organic acids” and “both enantiomeric 
forms or their mixture.” The counterpart Canadian 
'875 patent states that when the desired 
structure is obtained it “is isolated and, if desired, 
its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by 
mineral or organic acid action.” Apotex concedes 
that the references do not show any separated enantiomers 
or describe how to separate them, but argues 
that such detail is not required because persons 
of ordinary skill would know the existing techniques 
for separating enantiomers. 

[5] Apotex thus argues that the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer of MATTPCA cannot be deemed novel, 
as a matter of law. However, as the district court recognized, 
that is not the correct view of the law of 
anticipation, which requires the specific description 
as well as enablement of the subject matter at issue. 
To anticipate, the reference “must not only disclose 
all elements of the claim within the four corners of 
the document, but must also disclose those elements 
‘arranged as in the claim.’ ” Net MoneyIN, 
Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1369 
(Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting Connell v. Sears, Roebuck 
& Co., 722 F.2d 1542, 1548 (Fed.Cir.1983)); see 
also, e.g., In re Arkley, 59 C.C.P.A. 804, 455 F.2d 
586, 587 (1972) (“[The] reference must clearly and 
unequivocally disclose the claimed [invention] or 
direct those skilled in the art to the [invention] 
without any need for picking, choosing, and combining 
various disclosures not directly related to 
each other by the teachings of the cited reference” 
(emphasis in original)). 
The district court analyzed the question as 
whether a generic disclosure necessarily anticipates

550 F.3d 1075, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1370 

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

everything within the genus, and recognized that 
the answer depends on the factual aspects of the 
specific disclosure and the particular products at issue. 
See, e.g., Atofina v. Great Lakes Chem. Corp., 
441 F.3d 991, 999 (Fed.Cir.2006) (“It *1084 is well 
established that the disclosure of a genus in the prior 
art is not necessarily a disclosure of every species 
that is a member of that genus.”). In In re 
Ruschig, 52 C.C.P.A. 1238, 343 F.2d 965, 974 
(1965), the court declined to find the disclosed 
genus anticipatory of everything within its scope, 
when the description of the genus would not lead a 
person of ordinary skill to a “small recognizable 
class with common properties.” In this case the district 
court correctly declined to find that the references' 
general statements that these compounds 
consist of enantiomers constituted an anticipating 
disclosure of the separated dextrorotatory enantiomer 
of PCR 4099. 

The district court discussed the cases on which 
Apotex particularly relied: In re Petering, 49 

C.C.P.A. 993, 301 F.2d 676 (1962), and In re 
Schaumann, 572 F.2d 312 (CCPA 1978). The court 
pointed out that in Petering and Schaumann the 
generic disclosure in the reference identified 
“specific preferences,” which were met by the later-
described species. We discern no clear error in the 
district court's finding that the references herein 
contained no such specific preferences. PCR 4099 
is shown in the references as one of several compounds 
with desirable biological properties, but the 
district court did not clearly err in finding that the 
reference disclosure would not have led one of ordinary 
skill to recognize either an explicit or an inherent 
disclosure of its dextrorotatory enantiomer, 
as well as the bisulfate salt. 
Apotex also relies on In re Adamson, 47 

C.C.P.A. 839, 275 F.2d 952 (1960), where the court 
held that although the reference did not state that 
the disclosed compound was a racemate, it would 
have been known to one of ordinary skill that synthetically 
produced chiral compounds are racemic. 
Sanofi does not dispute this statement of stereo-
chemistry, but points out that knowledge of the existence 
of enantiomers is not a description of a specific 
enantiomer “substantially separated” from the 
other, as in claim 3 of the '265 patent. The district 
court cited In re May, 574 F.2d 1082 (CCPA 1978), 
which is explicit that “the novelty of an optical isomer 
is not negated by the prior art disclosure of its 
racemate.” Id. at 1090. Also, Adamson and May 
were addressing rejections for obviousness, and 
neither case stated or suggested a previously unseparated 
and unknown enantiomer might be deemed 
anticipated by the known racemate. 

The district court did not clearly err in finding 
that the statements in the ' 596 patent and its Canadian 
counterpart that the products therein consist of 
enantiomers are not a description of the specific 
dextrorotatory enantiomer clopidogrel or a suggestion 
of its unusual stereospecific properties. The 
knowledge that enantiomers may be separated is 
not “anticipation” of a specific enantiomer that has 
not been separated, identified, and characterized. 
The district court correctly held that neither the ' 
596 patent nor its Canadian counterpart contains an 
anticipating disclosure of the subject matter of 
claim 3 of the '265 patent. 

B 

[6] The parties also debated the question of enablement 
with respect to anticipation. The district 
court found that the asserted references are not enabling, 
for they contain no guidance as to how to 
separate the enantiomers of PCR 4099. Based on 
the evidence adduced at trial, the court concluded 
that absent such guidance, undue experimentation 
would be required. 
Apotex argues that it is entitled to a presumption 
of enablement because the asserted references 
are patents, which are presumed to be enabling because 
they are presumed valid, citing *1085Amgen 
Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 
1313, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“We hold that an accused 
infringer should be similarly entitled to have 
the district court presume the enablement of unclaimed 
(and claimed) material in a prior art patent

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

defendant asserts against a plaintiff.”). Apotex argues 
that the presumption should be particularly 
strong here, because the prior art patents belong to 
Sanofi. Thus Apotex argues that the general statements 
in the reference patents concerning enantiomers 
are presumptively enabling of the separate 
enantiomers of PCR 4099. Apotex states that it is 
irrelevant whether the separation of this specific enantiomer 
is shown in the references, because a person 
of ordinary skill in this field would know all of 
the existing techniques for separating stereoisomers, 
and would presumptively succeed in this 
particular separation. Apotex points out that the 
method that was eventually used by Sanofi was a 
well-known method, even if it involved some experimentation. 


[7] Any presumption of enablement of prior art 
does not exclude consideration of whether undue 
experimentation would be required to achieve enablement. 
See, e.g., Elan Pharms, 346 F.3d at 1054 
(the reference must teach how to carry out the invention 
without undue experimentation). The 
factors relevant to whether experimentation is undue 
are discussed in, e.g., In re Wands, 858 F.2d 
731, 737 (Fed.Cir.1988), and include the quantity 
of experimentation that was actually needed, the 
amount of guidance provided in the reference, the 
presence or absence of actual examples of the experimental 
procedure, the state of the knowledge 
already available concerning the subject matter at 
issue, and the predictability or unpredictability in 
the specific area of science or technology. The '596 
patent reference states only that “if desired, its enantiomers 
are separated,” and similarly for the Canadian 
counterpart. The district court found that 
these references contain no description of how to 
separate the enantiomers of PCR 4099, and that 
“[d]iscovering which method and what combination 
of variables is required is sufficiently arduous and 
uncertain as to require undue experimentation, even 
by one skilled in the relevant art.” Sanofi III, 492 
F.Supp.2d at 387. This finding has not been shown 
to be clearly erroneous. In Forest Laboratories, Inc. 
v. Ivax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 501 F.3d 1263 
(Fed.Cir.2007), this court recognized the known 
difficulty of separating enantiomers and the unpredictability 
of their properties, and held that a reference 
that stated that a compound has enantiomers 
did not enable the separation of those enantiomers, 
where the reference did not teach how to obtain the 
enantiomer. Id. at 1268-69. We discern no clear error 
in the district court's finding herein that the reference 
patents would not have enabled a person of 
ordinary skill to obtain clopidogrel substantially 
separated from the levorotatory enantiomer. 

The district court's ruling that claim 3 of the ' 
265 patent is not invalid for anticipation is affirmed. 


OBVIOUSNESS 

[8][9] The determination of obviousness is a 
matter of law based on findings of underlying fact, 
wherein the factors identified in Graham v. John 
Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 
545 (1966), guide the inquiry: 

Under § 103, the scope and content of the prior 
art are to be determined; differences between the 
prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; 
and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent 
art resolved. Against this background the 
obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject 
matter is determined. Such secondary considerations 
*1086 as commercial success, long felt but 
unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be 
utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding 
the origin of the subject matter sought 
to be patented. 

Id. at 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684. 

[10][11][12] The determination of obviousness 
is made with respect to the subject matter as a 
whole, not separate pieces of the claim. See KSR 
Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 
1727, 1734, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007); Kimberly-
Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 745 F.2d 1437, 
1448 (Fed.Cir.1984). For chemical compounds, the

separable considerations in the obviousness determination. 
See In re Sullivan, 498 F.3d 1345, 1353 
(Fed.Cir.2007); In re Papesch, 50 C.C.P.A. 1084, 
315 F.2d 381, 391 (1963). Precedent establishes the 
analytical procedure whereby a close structural 
similarity between a new chemical compound and 
prior art compounds is generally deemed to create a 
prima facie case of obviousness, shifting to the patentee 
the burden of coming forward with evidence 
of nonobviousness. The evidence may take various 
forms, as relevant in the particular case. See, e.g.,

Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1358, 1362-63 (Fed.Cir.2007)

provided a suggestion or reason to choose a specific 
lead compound for modification, or to make the 
specific modification of the compound at issue); 

Eisai Co. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs., Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353, 
1359 (Fed.Cir.2008) (same). The ultimate determination 
is made in the context of the Graham factors, 
with the challenger having the ultimate burden of 
proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. 
See Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 
1348, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007). 

The district court assumed that Apotex had 
made a prima facie case of obviousness based on 
the reference patents' disclosure of the PCR 4099 
racemate, the statements in the patents concerning 
enantiomers, and the general knowledge that enantiomers 
may be separated and may differ from each 
other in biological properties. Upon consideration 
of the Graham factors, the court held that the unpredictable 
and unusual properties of the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer and the therapeutic advantages 
thereby provided, weighed in favor of nonobviousness, 
and that Apotex had not met its burden of establishing 
otherwise. 

Apotex argues that the recognition in the prior 
art that PCR 4099 is composed of enantiomers outweighs 
the effect of any unexpected or unpredictable 
properties of the separated dextrorotatory enantiomer. 
Apotex asserts that Sanofi's previous selection 
of PCR 4099 as a promising replacement for 

ticlopidine would have led a skilled artisan to start 
with PCR 4099 as a lead compound for further research. 
Apotex states that it was well known that 
enantiomers can have different levels of biological 
activity even if the exact allocation of properties is 
unpredictable, thereby rendering it obvious to separate 
the enantiomers and determine their properties. 
Apotex contends that the only features of clopidogrel 
bisulfate arguably not explicit in the prior 
art-the separation of the dextrofrom the levorotatory 
enantiomer and its preparation as a bisulfate 
salt-required no more than well-known chemical 
techniques. Apotex cites known examples of other 
chiral compounds that exhibit stereoselectivity, and 
argues that the general knowledge that a favorable 
allocation of properties is possible suffices to 
render the separation obvious to a person of ordinary 
skill. 

*1087 Apotex thus argues that there was motivation 
to separate the enantiomers of PCR 4099, 
and that a person of ordinary skill in the field would 
have been able to do so using known procedures, 
even if some experimentation was required, and 
then, upon separation of the enantiomers, routine 
testing would have revealed the favorable allocation 
of properties in the dextrorotatory isomer. 
Apotex asserts that it is not material that this allocation 
was unknown in advance and unpredictable, 
and that what matters is whether a person of ordinary 
skill would have had a reasonable probability of 
success in the separation and evaluation of the enantiomer, 
citing Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364, wherein 
this court observed that “case law is clear that obviousness 
cannot be avoided simply by a showing of 
some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as 
there was a reasonable probability of success.” 

Sanofi responds by challenging Apotex's view 
of the law, and citing the evidence on the factual 
premises of these arguments. At trial the expert witnesses 
for both sides agreed that a person of ordinary 
skill in this field in the mid-1980s would have 
known that enantiomers can exhibit different biological 
activities. However, the experts also agreed

550 F.3d 1075, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1370 

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

that it was not predictable whether such differences, 
if any, would be weak, moderate, or strong, or how 
they would be manifested. The experts agreed that 
no known scientific principle allows prediction of 
the degree to which stereoisomers will exhibit different 
levels of therapeutic activity and toxicity. 
The experts agreed that weak stereoselectivity of 
biological properties is more common than strong 
stereoselectivity, and that absolute stereoselectivity 
is rare. Sanofi witnesses testified as to the research 
team's belief, based on the earlier separations of 
two other thienopyridines, that separation of enantiomers 
was unlikely to be productive. Apotex's expert, 
when asked whether one could predict in advance 
the therapeutic and toxic properties of the enantiomers, 
stated: “No. I certainly don't believe you 
could predict that without separating them and trying 
it. I can't imagine anybody presuming anything 
else.” The experts also agreed that activity and toxicity 
were more likely to be positively correlated, 
such that a reduction in toxicity would be expected 
also to reduce the beneficial activity. Witnesses 
also explained that it was known that for compounds 
whose biological activity is delivered 
through metabolism within the body, the acid environment 
in the stomach or other metabolic processes 
often restores the racemic state, thereby removing 
any potential benefit of a separated enantiomer. On 
the basis of this trial evidence, the district court 
found that a person of ordinary skill in this field 
would not reasonably have predicted that the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer would provide all of the antiplatelet 
activity and none of the adverse neurotoxicity. 
Clear error has not been shown in this finding, 
and in the conclusion of nonobviousness based 
thereon. See Papesch, 315 F.2d at 391 (a chemical 
compound and its properties are inseparable). 

The district court also discussed the evidence 
concerning the process of separating the enantiomers 
of PCR 4099. Apotex argued that Sanofi's 
separation procedure was well known, and therefore 
that the separated components of the known racemate 
were obvious as a matter of law, whether or 
not they were deemed to have unexpected proper


ties. The district court observed that in 1987 there 
were at least ten techniques that had been used to 
separate enantiomers, and that they all required experimentation 
to determine whether they could be 
successful for a particular compound, including 
choices of reagents, solvents, concentrations, temperature, 
and a variety of other conditions. *1088 
The court observed that Pasteur's diastereomeric 
salt formation technique had long been described in 
chemistry textbooks, but that the textbooks also explain 
that the method is difficult and that there is no 
“infallible recipe” for obtaining separation. 

The district court referred to the testimony of 
Sanofi's expert, Dr. Stephen G. Davies, who stated, 
in discussing the diastereomeric salt formation 
method, that it is difficult indeed to cause one enantiomer 
to crystallize out of solution while the other 
does not. As discussed ante in connection with anticipation, 
Mr. Badorc's eventual success came only 
after several failures using other known strategies 
for enantiomer separation. The court observed that 
although Sanofi had previously separated the enantiomers 
of two other thienopyridines, the diastereomeric 
salt formation method had succeeded in one 
case but failed in the other. The court also found 
that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized 
that it could be more difficult to separate the 
enantiomers of PCR 4099 than the two other compounds 
that Mr. Badorc had previously separated, 
because it would be understood by chemists that the 
methyl ester substituent in PCR 4099 could make it 
more susceptible to re-racemization, and thus resistant 
to successfully obtaining a separated product. 

The district court found that this separation was 
not a simple or routine procedure and that success 
in separation, as well as the allocation of properties, 
was unpredictable. The court observed that Apotex 
did not cite any reference showing or suggesting 
any reliable method of separation for any analogous 
compounds. The court described the separation as a 
“paradigm of trial and error,” Sanofi III, 492 
F.Supp.2d at 370, and found that “neither the chemists 
at Sanofi nor a person of ordinary skill in the

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

art could have reasonably expected that the separate 
enantiomers of PCR 4099 could be obtained at the 
time that Sanofi was contemplating whether to investigate 
them and, if obtained, they could not have 
predicted by what method and configuration.” Id. at 

371. The court found that Sanofi's expenditure of 
tens of millions of dollars for several years of development 
of the racemate PCR 4099, before separating 
the enantiomers, also weighed against finding 
that separation would have been obvious. Again, 
Apotex has demonstrated no clear error in the extensive 
finding of the district court concerning the 
difficulty and unpredictability of the separation of 
these enantiomers. These unchallenged findings undermine 
Apotex's argument in this appeal that the 
separation of the enantiomers would have been obvious. 
Only with hindsight knowledge that the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer has highly desirable properties, 
can Apotex argue that it would have been obvious 
to select this particular racemate and undertake 
its arduous separation. The application of hindsight 
is inappropriate where the prior art does not 
suggest that this enantiomer could reasonably be 
expected to manifest the properties and advantages 
that were found for this particular dextrorotatory 
isomer. See Graham, 383 U.S. at 36, 86 S.Ct. 684 
(cautioning against hindsight whereby the teachings 
of the invention are read into the prior art); see also 
KSR v. Teleflex, 127 S.Ct. at 1742 (recognizing 
“hindsight bias” and “ex post reasoning” as inappropriate 
in determination of obviousness). 
Concerning the bisulfate salt, the district court 
found no evidentiary support for Apotex's argument 
that the '596 patent taught the dextrorotatory enantiomer 
of PCR 4099 as the bisulfate salt. The PCR 
4099 racemate is shown in the '596 patent as the 
hydrochloride, not the bisulfate. The district court 
observed that the scientific literature listed eighty 
acids as candidates for forming salts with basic 
drug *1089 compounds, fifty-three of which acids 
had been used in FDA-approved drugs. The experts 
of both parties agreed that whether a pharmaceutically 
suitable crystalline salt will form from a particular 
acid-base combination is unpredictable. The 

district court distinguished the facts of this case 
from those of Pfizer, 480 F.3d 1348, where there 
was evidence that based on the prior art a person of 
ordinary skill would have narrowed the possible 
salts to only a few including the claimed besylate, 
whereas here Sanofi presented evidence that the 
prior art taught away from the use of sulfuric acid 
with an enantiomer, for strong acids could encourage 
re-racemization. Apotex has shown no clear error 
in the district court's finding, based on the trial 
evidence, that the facts distinguish this case from 
those in Pfizer. 

Based on all of these findings, the district court 
concluded: “Whether or not it may have been 
‘obvious to try’ separating the enantiomers of PCR 
4099 and, secondarily, preparing its dextrorotatory 
enantiomer as a bisulfate salt, the wide range of 
possible outcomes and the relative unlikelihood that 
the resulting compound would exhibit the maximal 
increase in antiplatelet aggregation activity and the 
absence of neurotoxicity makes clopidogrel bisulfate 
non-obvious.” Sanofi III, 492 F.Supp.2d at 392. 
Apotex argues that the district court applied an incorrect 
inquiry, and that the correct inquiry is not 
whether the results obtained with the separated enantiomer 
were unexpected, but whether it would 
have been obvious to separate and test the enantiomers, 
based on the general knowledge that enantiomers 
can exhibit different properties. Apotex 
refers to In re Adamson, 275 F.2d at 955, where the 
CCPA held that an enantiomer would have been obvious 
in view of its racemate. However, the scientific 
facts differed from these herein, for in 
Adamson the court found that it was “particularly 
expected” that the specific enantiomer would have 
the observed properties. In contrast, as Sanofi 
points out, in In re May, 574 F.2d at 1095, the 
CCPA held, as to the enantiomer claimed therein, 
that the appellant “established a substantial record 
of unpredictability vis-à-vis a highly significant 
combination of properties.” 

The determination of obviousness is dependent 
on the facts of each case. See Graham, 383 U.S. at

(Cite as: 550 F.3d 1075) 

17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684. In Forest Laboratories, 501 
F.3d at 1269, this court affirmed that the (+) enantiomer 
of citalopram would not have been obvious 
in light of the known racemate, when it was shown 
that the therapeutic properties of the (+) enantiomer 
were unexpected. In contrast, in Aventis Pharma 
Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd. 499 F.3d 1293, 
1302 (Fed.Cir.2007), this court held that the ramipril 
isomer's potency was “precisely what one 
would expect, as compared to a mixture containing 
other, inert or near-inert stereoisomers.” Apotex argues 
that Aventis is the closer analogy, but the evidence 
was directly contrary to that position. The district 
court entered extensive findings in this case on 
the unexpected and unpredictable properties of 
clopidogrel, and there was no contrary evidence 
suggesting, based on the prior art, that the stereoselective 
properties were “precisely what one would 
expect,” as in Aventis. 

Apotex also argued in the district court, and repeats 
on this appeal, that Sanofi separated the enantiomers 
only because of a possible future regulatory 
requirement concerning the separation of enantiomers. 
Apotex states that this future regulatory requirement 
would have alerted a person of ordinary 
skill to the need to separate isomers, and thus 
would have rendered it obvious to do so. The district 
court found that the sole evidence referring to 
this regulatory possibility, an internal Sanofi 
memorandum, was written *1090 several months 
after Sanofi had discontinued its development of 
the racemic PCR 4099 in favor of the dextrorotatory 
enantiomer; the court also cited the testimony 
and documentary evidence that Sanofi undertook 
this separation in order to study the adverse neurological 
effects of PCR 4099, and not because of a 
possible future regulatory requirement. Sanofi also 
points out, as the general knowledge in this field 
confirms, that the recognition that stereoisomers 
may exhibit different properties does not teach 
which results may ensue or how to separate any 
given enantiomers. We discern no error in the short 
shrift that the district court gave to this argument. 

Apotex also argues that the district court did 
not take adequate account of the Supreme Court's 
holding in KSR v. Teleflex that the “combination of 
familiar elements according to known methods is 
likely to be obvious when it does no more than 
yield predictable results.” 127 S.Ct. at 1739. Apotex 
states that Sanofi did no more than separate the 
enantiomers and determine their properties, and that 
the properties were predictably those of the racemate, 
allocated between the enantiomers. Sanofi 
points out that this case does not concern a 
“combination of familiar elements” as in the KSR 
mechanical device made by combining known components 
to produce a combination having the properties 
of the known components. The evidence at 
trial well supported the finding that the result of 
this separation of enantiomers was unpredictable. 
We discern no error in the district court's implicit 
recognition that the principles of KSR do not affect 
the conclusion herein. 

The district court thoroughly discussed the 
many issues and arguments raised by Apotex. We 
discern no error in the district court's findings that, 
on the state of the prior art, a person of ordinary 
skill would not have had the expectation that separating 
the enantiomers would be likely to produce an 
isomer having absolute stereoselectivity as to both 
the favorable antiplatelet activity and the unfavorable 
neurotoxicity. The totality of these findings, 
and the correct application of law, well support the 
district court's conclusion that invalidity had not 
been established by clear and convincing evidence.

Alphapharm Pty. Ltd. and Genpharm, Inc. 
(collectively, “Alphapharm”) and Mylan Laboratories, 
Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and UDL 
Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, “Mylan”) appeal 
from the final judgment of the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York. 
On September 20, 2006, the court granted a motion 
by plaintiff and patentee Takeda Chemical Industries, 
Ltd. and its affiliate Takeda Pharmaceuticals 
North America, Inc. (collectively, “Takeda”) to find 
the case relating to Hatch-Waxman challenges 
made by Alphapharm and Mylan in connection with 
Takeda's U.S. Patent 4,687,777 (“the '777 patent”) 
to be exceptional and to award attorney fees. Takeda 
Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 459 
F.Supp.2d 227 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (“ September Opinion”). 
On March 21, 2007, the court quantified the 
attorney fees, expenses, and expert fees, awarding 
Takeda $11,400,000 from Mylan and *1384 

$5,400,000 from Alphapharm, with interest. Takeda 
Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., Nos. 
03-8253, 04-1966, 2007 WL 840368 (S.D.N.Y. 
Mar. 21, 2007) (“ March Opinion ”). Because we 
conclude that the district court did not clearly err in 
finding that this was an exceptional case because of 
the misconduct of Mylan and Alphapharm and did 
not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees, 
we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

The '777 patent covers the anti-diabetic drug 
pioglitazone, for which Takeda has enjoyed commercial 
success under the name ACTOS ®. Alphapharm 
and Mylan are two generic drug companies 
that sought approval to produce generic versions 
of pioglitazone under the Hatch-Waxman Act. That 
legislation provides the mechanism for a generic 
drug company to file an abbreviated new drug application 
(“ANDA”). An ANDA announces the intention 
of the filer to sell a bioequivalent form of a 
drug when approved by the FDA, and the filer 
makes a certification regarding existing patents 
covering the drug and its use. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j) 
(2006). Both Mylan and Alphapharm chose to make 
certifications pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) (“Paragraph IV”), certifying 
that the '777 patent was invalid for obviousness. In 
response, Takeda sued Alphapharm and Mylan for 
infringement. 

At trial, Alphapharm and Mylan each changed 
the focus of their invalidity arguments from those 
in their certification letters. Alphapharm pointed to 
a compound referred to as compound b, which 
Takeda disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,287,200 (“the 

FN1

'200 patent”) and in a 1982 scientific article 
(“Sohda II”), as evidence that pioglitazone was 
structurally obvious at the time the invention was 
made. Mylan advanced an inequitable conduct argument 
based on alleged misrepresentations by 
Takeda to the Patent and Trademark Office 
(“PTO”). On February 21, 2006, after an extensive 
bench trial, the district court held the invention of 
the '777 patent to be nonobvious and enforceable.

Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 417 
F.Supp.2d 341 (S.D.N.Y.2006). The district court 
entered final judgment on March 13, 2006, and we 
affirmed the district court in two separate appeals.

2007).

Derivatives, 30 Chem. Pharm. Bull. 3580 
(1982). 

Takeda then moved for an award of attorney 
fees against both Mylan and Alphapharm on the 
theory that this was an exceptional case. When a 
patent has been infringed by the filing of an ANDA, 
35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4) provides for the grant of 
attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285, which in turn 
allows the court to award reasonable attorney fees 
to a prevailing party in exceptional cases. Takeda 
contended that Mylan and Alphapharm each lacked 
a good faith basis for their Paragraph IV letters and 
engaged in misconduct throughout the litigation. 

On September 20, 2006, the district court 
agreed with Takeda in an opinion that discussed the 
Paragraph IV letters and litigation conduct of Alphapharm 
and Mylan in the same thorough manner 
as the court's previous decision regarding the validity 
of the '777 patent. Regarding Alphapharm, the 
court held that the Paragraph IV certification letter 
was “so devoid *1385 of merit and so completely 
fail[ed] to establish a prima facie case of invalidity 
that it must be described as ‘baseless.’ ” September 
Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 235. The court discussed 
at length how Alphapharm's argument at trial focused 
on compound b as the lead compound for future 
research, whereas Alphapharm's certification 
letter focused on two other compounds and contained 
scientific errors. The court also analyzed 
what it saw as Alphapharm's litigation misconduct, 

which mainly consisted of a shifting theory of obviousness 
that did not explain why compound b 
would have been identified as the lead compound. 
As a result, the court found that this was “the exceptional 
case where an examination of the totality 
of the circumstances amply justifies, indeed compels, 
the award of attorneys' fees.” Id. at 245. 

Similarly, the court held that Mylan's certification 
letter was filed in bad faith and with no reasonable 
basis to claim the '777 patent invalid. The 
court discussed how Mylan argued in its Paragraph 
IV letter that the invention of pioglitazone was obvious 
based on Takeda's disclosure of a compound 
in the ' 200 patent and Sohda II (referred to as compound 
16 and compound 14, respectively) only to 
abandon this theory entirely during the litigation. In 
addition, the court discussed Takeda's numerous allegations 
of litigation misconduct committed by 
Mylan in its pursuit of an inequitable conduct 
claim, which principally addressed Takeda's representations 
to the PTO regarding a different compound 
disclosed in the prior art, compound 3894. 
The court also found that the inequitable conduct 
claim was “always frivolous” and unsupported, as 
Mylan did not present any evidence that Takeda hid 
or misrepresented any information to the PTO. Id. 
at 249. The court concluded that the totality of the 
circumstances, including other instances of Mylan's 
untimely conduct, justified the award of attorney 
fees against Mylan as well. 

On March 21, 2007, the district court quantified 
the fees at $16,800,000, with Alphapharm to 
pay $5,400,000 and Mylan, $11,400,000. In assessing 
the amount of the award, the court stated that 
the attorneys for Takeda did uniformly excellent 
work in a complex and contentious litigation. When 
allocating the attorney fees, the court accepted the 
division proposed by Takeda, with Mylan responsible 
for two-thirds of the total amount. The court 
also awarded Takeda its expert fees under its inherent 
power to impose sanctions, along with expenses 
and interest beginning on the date of the September 
Opinion.

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

Mylan and Alphapharm filed separate timely 
appeals from the district court's judgment. The appeals 
were consolidated on December 17, 2007. We 
have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1295(a)(1). 

DISCUSSION 

A. Exceptional Case Finding 
[1] 35 U.S.C. § 285 provides that a trial court 
“in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney 
fees to the prevailing party.” The decision to 
award attorney fees is within the discretion of the 
trial judge, but the conclusion that a case is exceptional 
is a finding of fact reviewable only for clear 
error. Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. LKB Produkter 
AB, 892 F.2d 1547, 1551 (Fed.Cir.1989). We address 
the arguments of the appellants with regard to 
the district court's finding of an exceptional case individually. 
1. Alphapharm 
On appeal, Alphapharm argues that its Paragraph 
IV letter was not baseless under structural 
obviousness law. Alphapharm asserts that its certification 
letter *1386 made out a prima facie case of 
obviousness and that, contrary to what the district 
court held, Alphapharm was not required to explain 
why a skilled artisan would have identified compound 
b as the lead compound in its certification 
letter. As evidence of what it argues was a reasonable 
chance to succeed, Alphapharm points to 
Judge Dyk's concurrence in the prior decision of 
this court. Alphapharm also argues that the fact that 
its original theory did not prevail at trial falls far 
short of clear and convincing evidence required for 
the district court to find that its certification letter 
was baseless. Alphapharm further claims that affirming 
the district court's ruling would chill challenges 
by generic drug companies to otherwise invalid 
patents by requiring the inclusion of every 
possible theory of invalidity in a certification letter 
rather than allowing an ANDA filer to develop its 
theories during the course of discovery. Similarly, 
Alphapharm argues that the district court erred in 
finding litigation misconduct because Alphapharm 

consistently argued an obviousness theory and 
merely honed its arguments in response to documents 
produced during discovery by Takeda. Alphapharm 
also disagrees with the court's characterization 
of certain of its evidence as an attempt to inject 
an inequitable conduct argument into the obviousness 
inquiry. 

Alphapharm and Mylan are supported in this 
appeal by amicus curiae, the Generic Pharmaceutical 
Association, who submitted a brief and was permitted 
to orally argue before the court. Amicus argues 
that failure to reverse the district court's finding 
of an exceptional case would deter generic applicants 
from presenting defenses at trial that were 
not included in their certification letters. Amicus 
asserts that changing defenses is normal conduct 
during litigation, especially in patent cases, when 
ANDA applicants prepare certification letters 
without the benefit of discovery. As a result, 
amicus argues, ANDA filers should be allowed to 
litigate the best available theories at trial, regardless 
of their inclusion in certification letters. Amicus asserts 
that if the district court decision stands, it will 
have a chilling effect on future ANDA patent challenges. 


Takeda responds that Alphapharm's argument, 
that it should benefit from a presumption of obviousness 
based on structural considerations, has 
already been rejected by this court. In addition, 
Takeda points out that Alphapharm's certification 
letter included scientific errors and that Judge Dyk's 
concurrence did not address the claim of the '777 
patent specific to pioglitazone, the invalidity of 
which was necessary for Alphapharm's success. Finally, 
Takeda asserts that the record amply supports 
the district court's finding that Alphapharm presented 
constantly shifting, but always baseless, obviousness 
arguments. That finding, Takeda argues, 
supports the court's conclusion that Alphapharm's 
obviousness theories never had a good faith basis 
and thus warranted an exceptional case finding. 

As noted by Takeda, we have already held that 
the district court did not commit reversible error by

549 F.3d 1381, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1218 

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

refusing to apply a presumption of motivation to select 
compound b as the lead compound based on 
structural obviousness. See Takeda, 492 F.3d at 
1360. Accordingly, although Alphapharm made 
brief reference to compound b in its Paragraph IV 
letter, it failed to provide any reason in its Paragraph 
IV letter to identify compound b as the lead 
compound and thus did not make out a prima facie 
case of obviousness based on the structural similarity 
between compound b and pioglitazone. Any 
support Alphapharm hopes to gain from Judge 
Dyk's concurrence is moreover lacking, as his opinion 
addressed the possible overbreadth*1387 of two 
claims in the ' 777 patent and not, as Alphapharm 
claims, structural obviousness based on the prior 
disclosure of compound b. Id. at 1364 (Dyk, J., 
concurring). 

Furthermore, although it seems reasonable to 
expect assertions of invalidity based on prior art to 
remain relatively consistent as the prior art should 
be known when the certification of invalidity is 
made, we do not believe that the district court faulted 
Alphapharm simply for changing its obviousness 
argument at trial from the theory advanced in 
the Paragraph IV letter. Rather, the court methodically 
examined a number of shortcomings in Alphapharm's 
Paragraph IV letter, which were made 
obvious by Alphapharm's “constantly shifting set of 
arguments,” that supported the finding that the certification 
was baseless. September Opinion, 459 
F.Supp.2d at 236. The court noted the stark contrast 
between Alphapharm's focus on compound b as the 
lead compound at trial with its discussion in the 
certification letter of two other compounds disclosed 
in Sohda II and how, as a result, Alphapharm 
“did not grapple with the many impediments 
evident in Sohda II for choosing compound 

(b) as a lead compound.” Id. The court also catalogued 
scientific errors in Alphapharm's certification 
letter that the court saw as “insidious” and as 
underscoring that Alphapharm “did not act with due 
care or in good faith” in filing its certification. Id. 
at 237. The court found that other assertions in Alphapharm's 
Paragraph IV letter were baseless because 
of undisputed evidence of pioglitazone's superiority 
and that Alphapharm abandoned these arguments 
at trial because “they were unsupportable, 
not because Alphapharm made a tactical decision 
regarding which argument should be emphasized at 
trial.” Id. at 238. The court concluded that the deficiencies 
in Alphapharm's Paragraph IV letter were 
“so glaring” that they highlighted that Alphapharm 
“acted in bad faith in filing its Paragraph IV certification.” 
Id. at 239. 

The court also discussed in depth what it saw 
as Alphapharm's litigation misconduct. The court 
traced the many iterations of Alphapharm's theory 
of obviousness and pointed to Alphapharm's “utter 
failure” to account for the identification of compound 
b as the lead compound as required under 
structural obviousness law. Id. at 241. The court 
reasoned that Alphapharm had over two years to 
develop its obviousness arguments in its Paragraph 
IV letter, and its failure to explain “why its Statement 
was so flawed and why its description of obviousness 
went through such a dramatic evolution” 
was “overwhelming” evidence of Alphapharm's bad 
faith. Id. at 243. Finally, the court discussed assertions 
made by Alphapharm that were unrelated to 
the obviousness claim and “created confusion, 
wasted valuable court time, and increased the burden 
of the litigation on the parties.” Id. When considering 
the totality of the circumstances, the court 
stated bluntly, “This case was not close.” Id. at 244. 
The court's conviction in its findings could hardly 
be clearer. 

A number of different circumstances may support 
the finding of an exceptional case, including 
“vexatious or unjustified litigation” or “frivolous 
suit,” of which there must be clear and convincing 
evidence. Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1551. Indeed, one 
of the purposes of § 285 is to prevent “ ‘gross injustice’ 
when the accused infringer has litigated in 
bad faith.” Id. at 1552. In Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical 
Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., we stated 
that “[t]he joint operation of §§ 271(e) and 285 require 
the paragraph (2) infringer to display care and

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

regard for the strict standards of the Hatch-Waxman 
Act when challenging patent validity.... *1388 The 
Hatch-Waxman Act thus imposes a duty of care on 
an ANDA certifier.” 231 F.3d 1339, 1347 
(Fed.Cir.2000). Alphapharm now argues that 
Yamanouchi's “duty of care” language lays out a 
simple negligence standard. Alphapharm further 
contends that this standard conflicts with Beckman, 
which, Alphapharm argues, establishes the far higher 
threshold of gross negligence. Alphapharm is incorrect 
on both points. 

In the first place, Beckman does not set out a 
gross negligence standard. In Beckman, we stated 
that § 285 prevents “gross injustice” where a party 
has demonstrated “bad faith and misconduct during 
litigation.” Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1553. In addition, 
Yamanouchi does not establish a simple negligence 
standard, nor did the district court in this case apply 
such a standard. Although Yamanouchi states that 
ANDA applicants owe a duty of care under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act, it explained that applicants fail 
to meet this duty when they file “baseless” certifications. 
231 F.3d at 1347. Thus, Yamanouchi does 
not stand for the proposition that ANDA applicants 
who are merely negligent can trigger § 285. 

[2][3] In this case, the district court correctly 
found that Alphapharm's filing would amount to litigation 
misconduct supporting an exceptional case 
finding if it were “baseless” and if it “fail[ed] to 
present even a prima facie case of invalidity in filing 
the paragraph IV certification.” September 
Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 232. Thus, the trial court 
did not apply a simple negligence standard but 
found Alphapharm's filing “baseless.” Moreover, 
the trial court found misconduct during litigation. 
Given the district court's familiarity with the parties 
and the issues and its thorough discussion of Alphapharm's 
certification letter and litigation 
strategy, we cannot say that the court committed 
clear error in finding that this was an exceptional 
case due in part to the misconduct of Alphapharm. 
See Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1552 & n. 1 (noting that 
the district judge was in “the best position” to mon


itor litigation strategy and find bad faith). 

2. Mylan 
On appeal, Mylan argues that the district court 
based its finding of an exceptional case against 
Mylan on conjecture rather than requiring Takeda 
to show clear and convincing evidence. As support 
for its position, Mylan points to its decision not to 
pursue the same arguments at trial as in its Paragraph 
IV letter, arguing that because Mylan's original 
invalidity theory was never pursued, the court 
had to rely on speculation in finding the certification 
letter baseless. Mylan also asserts that its decision 
to amend its defenses to include a revised 
obviousness claim and an inequitable conduct claim 
did not constitute litigation misconduct or demonstrate 
bad faith because it is customary to develop 
defenses during discovery. Mylan argues that the 
fact that it ultimately did not win on these claims 
does not render this case exceptional. Furthermore, 
Mylan asserts that the district court's decision to allow 
Mylan to assert its inequitable conduct claim 
demonstrates that it was not frivolous and thus was 
not litigation misconduct. 

Takeda responds by pointing to the district 
court's analysis of the evidence regarding Mylan's 
certification letter and litigation misconduct. Takeda 
notes Mylan's error in characterizing compound 
14 and pioglitazone as bioisosteres in its Paragraph 
IV letter, which certified that pioglitazone was obvious 
based on the disclosure of compound 14 in 
the '200 patent and Sohda II. Takeda argues that 
this invalidity argument was so devoid of merit that 
Mylan did not pursue this obviousness *1389 claim 
in discovery and abandoned it before trial. Takeda 
then argues that Mylan suddenly asserted a revised 
obviousness theory centering on compound 3894 
that was similarly fraught with scientific errors. 
With regard to Mylan's inequitable conduct claim, 
Takeda asserts that this claim was also frivolous, as 
Mylan completely failed to present any evidence of 
intent to deceive the PTO, and notes that the court 
specifically stated that allowing Mylan to amend its 
defenses to include inequitable conduct did not

549 F.3d 1381, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1218 

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

mean that the amendment was timely or meritorious. 


[4] We conclude that the court did not commit 
clear error in finding that Mylan's misconduct contributed 
to this being an exceptional case. In fact, 
Mylan's invalidity argument in its certification letter 
appears even more baseless than Alphapharm's. 
Mylan certified that pioglitazone was rendered obvious 
because Takeda had already disclosed compound 
14, which had high efficacy, and simply replaced 
its benzene ring with a pyridine ring, which 
it described as a bioisostere, to create pioglitazone. 
But Mylan's Rule 30(b)(6) designee testified that no 
reason existed to choose compound 14 as the lead 
compound; Takeda's expert emphatically disagreed 
with the assertion that benzene and pyridine rings 
are bioisosteres; and Alphapharm's expert testified 
that the properties of compound 14 taught nothing 
with respect to pyridines. We find it unsurprising, 
therefore, that the district court characterized 
Mylan's defense of the merits of its Paragraph IV 
letter as “utterly frivolous.” September Opinion, 
459 F.Supp.2d at 247. In light of the scientific errors 
present in Mylan's certification letter, the fact 
that the court was unmoved by Mylan's decision not 
to pursue this obviousness claim at trial can hardly 
be deemed clear error. We believe the court had 
ample reason to hold that Mylan's certification letter 
was filed in bad faith and with no reasonable 
basis to claim the '777 patent invalid. 
Similarly, the finding that Mylan engaged in 
litigation misconduct was well-supported and explained 
by the district court. The court deemed 
Mylan's later argument based on compound 3894 to 
be “extremely misleading.” Id. at 247. In addition, 
the court discussed Takeda's seven asserted separate 
grounds for litigation misconduct committed by 
Mylan in its pursuit of an inequitable conduct 
claim. As Takeda points out, the district court 
stated that “its decision to allow Mylan to bring its 
claim of inequitable conduct was absolutely not a 
finding that it was timely or meritorious.” Id. at 

249. Accordingly, the court found that the inequitable 
conduct claim was “always frivolous” and unsupported, 
as Mylan did not present any evidence 
that Takeda hid or misrepresented any information 
to the PTO. Id. We do not find persuasive Mylan's 
argument that the district court took issue with the 
mere fact that Mylan changed its theory of invalidity 
and then lost. Rather, the court determined that 
Mylan's initial certification letter was completely 
baseless and that the claims Mylan offered as substitutes 
were similarly frivolous. In short, the district 
court, which was in the best position to evaluate 
the entire strategy pursued by Mylan, did not 
commit clear error in finding litigation misconduct. 

Finally, we find the “chilling” argument regarding 
ANDA filers advanced by Alphapharm and 
Mylan to be unpersuasive, despite the support 
provided by the amicus filing of the Generic Pharmaceutical 
Association. In making a Paragraph IV 
certification, appellants are statutorily required to 
“include a detailed statement of the factual and legal 
basis of the opinion of the applicant that the patent 
is invalid.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B)(iv)(II) 
(2006). It *1390 is clear from the district court's 
opinion that it was not faulting Alphapharm or 
Mylan for the act of filing an ANDA that challenged 
the pioglitazone patent, nor did it limit the 
filers to the theories raised in their certification letters. 
Rather, the district court found the case exceptional 
based on the specific circumstances involved 
in this case, viz., baseless certification letters compounded 
with litigation misconduct. In fact, the 
court addressed the deterrence argument directly: 

There is no basis to find that this award of fees 
will deter ANDA filings and litigation. This 
award addresses baseless ANDA filings and the 
pursuit of frivolous ANDA litigation in bad faith 
and other litigation misconduct. The Hatch-
Waxman Act cannot be read to immunize such 
conduct. 

September Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 251. 
Given the court's specific articulation that its ruling 
was directed toward baseless ANDA filings and litigation 
in bad faith, we decline to disturb the court's

finding of an exceptional case as potentially 
chilling non-frivolous ANDA filings under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act. Well-supported filings challenging 
the validity and infringement of patents 
owned by an NDA holder should not raise the 
specter of an unjustified holding of an exceptional 
case. 

B. Amount of Award 
[5][6] If a district court has not clearly erred in 
finding a case exceptional, we review the award of 
attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. Yamanouchi, 
231 F.3d at 1346. The abuse of discretion 
standard also applies to the district court's exercise 
of its inherent power to award sanctions. Amsted Indus. 
Inc. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co., 23 F.3d 
374, 379 (Fed.Cir.1994). Under that standard, we 
will affirm a district court unless its decision was 
“clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or fanciful, or 
based on an erroneous conclusion of law or fact.” 
Yamanouchi, 231 F.3d at 1346. 

Appellants argue that Takeda's award request 
was excessive for a litigation that lasted just two 
years and culminated in a nine-day trial. They point 
to Takeda's billing entries and expenses as excessive 
and inadequately supported in arguing that the 
district court abused its discretion by not reducing 
the award from the requested amount. Mylan also 
argues that the court abused its discretion in failing 
to consider opinions of Mylan's experts regarding 
the reasonableness of the award and that the court 
had no basis for its two-thirds allocation of the fee 
award to Mylan. Finally, both Alphapharm and 
Mylan assert that the additional sanctions of expert 
fees and expenses were unjustified because there 
was no evidence of fraud or abuse of the judicial 
process. 

Takeda responds that the district court examined 
all relevant factors in determining the 
amount of attorney fees, including the time entries 
and staffing of the litigation. Takeda also points to 
the court's analysis of Mylan's expert declarations 
and its reasoning for the allocation of the award in 
asserting that both decisions fell within the court's 

discretion. With regard to the expert fees, Takeda 
argues that the court had the discretion to impose a 
sanction because of the appellants' bad faith and 
vexatious conduct during the litigation. 

[7] Although the award of the total amount of a 
fee request is unusual, we have stated that such an 
award may be imposed and affirmed. See Beckman, 
892 F.2d at 1553 (“[W]e can certainly imagine a 
case in which litigation misconduct would justify 
an award of attorney fees for the entire litigation.”). 
That determination lies within the discretion of the 
trial judge, “who is in the best position to know 
how severely [a party's] misconduct has affected 
*1391 the litigation.” Id. Here, the district court left 
no doubt as to its opinion of the litigation and work 
performed by counsel. The court characterized the 
work of Takeda's counsel as “uniformly excellent” 
and determined that the attorney fee award was 
reasonable. March Opinion, 2007 WL 840368, at 
*4. Indeed, the court indicated that an even higher 
award would have been justified. The court found 
that none of the attacks on the size of the fee award 
had merit, and the court also gave specific reasons 
for disregarding Mylan's purported expert opinions, 
including a lack of experience on the part of the declarants 
with both the present litigation and patent 
litigation as a whole. Furthermore, the court explained 
its allocation of two-thirds of the fee burden 
to Mylan because it acted as lead defense counsel 
for discovery of the obviousness claims and then 
added considerably to the complexity of the case 
with an untimely assertion of an inequitable conduct 
claim. Given the court's reasoned analysis and 
familiarity with the litigation, we do not believe 
that the court abused its discretion with its award of 
attorney fees and related expenses. See Mathis v. 
Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 759 (Fed.Cir.1988) (allowing 
for the award of expenses under § 285). 
[8][9] As for the award of expert fees, a district 
court may invoke its inherent power to impose 
sanctions in the form of reasonable expert fees in 
excess of what is provided for by statute. See

F.2d at 759 (noting that “full expert witness fees 
have been awarded, without specific statutory authorization, 
upon a finding of bad faith”). The use 
of this inherent power is reserved for cases with “a 
finding of fraud or abuse of the judicial process.” 
Amsted, 23 F.3d at 378. While it is true that the appellants' 
conduct did not amount to fraud, courts 
may use sanctions in cases involving bad faith that 
cannot be otherwise reached by rules or statutes. 
See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 46, 111 S.Ct. 2123 
(discussing cases). Here, the court below could not 
award expert fees under § 285, but it was entitled to 
use its inherent powers to award Takeda the expert 
fees. Because of the court's numerous articulations 
of appellants' bad faith and vexatious litigation conduct, 
we cannot say that the decision to do so was 
an abuse of discretion. 

We have considered the other arguments raised 
by appellants and find them unpersuasive. 

CONCLUSION 

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's finding 
of an exceptional case and the award to Takeda 
of $16,800,000 for attorney fees, expenses, and expert 
fees, plus interest. 

AFFIRMED 

BRYSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and 
concurring in the result in part. 

I agree that the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in awarding Takeda attorney fees. As a 
practical matter, the task of determining whether a 
case is “exceptional” within the meaning of 35 

U.S.C. § 285 so as to justify an award of attorney 
fees is necessarily committed almost entirely to the 
judgment of the district court. A district judge who 
has lived with a case and the lawyers for an extended 
period (four years in this case) is infinitely better 
situated than we are to make the kind of holistic 
judgments about the parties' conduct of the litigation 
that are required to assess whether the case 
should be treated as exceptional and whether fees 
should be awarded. Where the trial court applies the 
proper legal standards and conducts a thorough review 
of the circumstances *1392 bearing upon the 
section 285 inquiry, there is little room for a reviewing 
court to second-guess the trial court's judgment. 
In this case, the trial judge's analysis was 
thorough and her finding that the case was exceptional 
was not based on the application of an erroneous 
legal standard. Under these circumstances, I 
agree with my colleagues that we cannot overturn 
the court's judgment as to the applicability of sanctions 
under section 285. 

With respect to the portion of the award attributable 
to expert witness fees, I would uphold the 
award, but on a narrow ground and with reservations. 
As the district court correctly understood, expert 
witness fees cannot be awarded as a sanction 
under section 285. For that reason, the court invoked 
the court's inherent authority to justify the 
award of expert witness fees. See Chambers v. 
NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 
L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). While we have recognized that 
district courts can award expert fees in patent cases 
under their inherent authority, we have made clear 
that “not every case qualifying as exceptional under 
section 285 will qualify for sanctions under the 
court's inherent power.” Amsted Indus. Inc. v. Buckeye 
Steel Castings Co., 23 F.3d 374, 378 
(Fed.Cir.1994). To the contrary, a district court 
may resort to its inherent power to impose sanctions 
only in those highly unusual cases in which 
the pertinent statutory remedies are plainly inadequate 
to address the misconduct at issue. Amsted, 
23 F.3d at 379 (“The court should resort to its inherent 
power only where the rules or statutes do not 
reach the acts which degrade the judicial system.... 
[C]ourts should only resort to further sanctions 
when misconduct remains unremedied by those initial 
tools.”); see also Martin v. Brown, 63 F.3d 
1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995) ( “inherent power should 
be reserved for those cases in which the conduct of 
a party or an attorney is egregious and no other 
basis for sanctions exists”); In re Rimsat, Ltd., 212 
F.3d 1039, 1048 (7th Cir.2000). Routine use of inherent 
authority to impose sanctions in addition to

549 F.3d 1381, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1218 

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

those authorized by applicable statutes risks contravening 
Congress's judgment as to what sanctions 
are appropriate for particular misconduct. See, e.g., 

Corley v. Rosewood Care Ctr., Inc., 142 F.3d 1041, 
1059 (7th Cir.1998); Klein v. Stahl GMBH & Co. 
Maschinefabrik, 185 F.3d 98, 110 n. 10 (3d 
Cir.1999). Where, as here, the district court's award 
of attorney fees under section 285 and expert witness 
fees under its inherent authority are predicated 
on the same conduct, the district court must offer a 
reasoned explanation for why the award of attorney 
fees and expenses under section 285 is not a sufficient 
sanction for the conduct in question. See Corley, 
142 F.3d at 1058-59 (“The court also should 
have explained why Rule 11 was inadequate to 
serve the court's purposes....”). 

There are obviously different degrees of unjustifiable 
conduct, and the district court must identify 
the considerations that justify distinguishing 
“between inappropriate conduct redressable under 
35 U.S.C. §§ 284, 285 and egregious conduct which 
justifies resort to the inherent power to sanction.” 
Amsted, 23 F.3d at 378. The problem is that the 
standard required to justify invoking the court's inherent 
authority to impose sanctions is extremely 
vague. The standard articulated by the Supreme 
Court permits a court to invoke its inherent powers 
if the court determines “that fraud has been practiced 
upon it, or that the very temple of justice has 
been defiled.” In this case, there is no suggestion 
that the defendants have engaged in fraudulent conduct. 
Instead, the court upholds the award of expert 
witness fees based on an abuse of judicial process, 
i.e., the “defiling the very temple of justice” rationale. 
Unfortunately, while that metaphor is colorful, 
it does not make for a *1393 very useful legal 
standard. What I take from the Supreme Court's 
opinion in Chambers and our decision in Amsted is 
that cases in which it will be considered appropriate 
to impose “inherent authority” sanctions in addition 
to those already imposed pursuant to statute or rule 
will be very rare. Indeed, in Amsted we found that 
the district court's exercise of its inherent power 
was unjustified even though the accused infringer 

continued to press its defenses knowing that they 
were meritless, burdened the court with unnecessary 
motions, and violated a court order. Amsted, 23 
F.3d at 378-79. While we acknowledged in Amsted 
that the sanctioned party had engaged in inappropriate 
conduct, we held that it did not constitute 
“egregious conduct” and “bad faith” of the sort necessary 
to justify resort to the inherent power to 
sanction. Id. at 379. 

In this case, the district court found 
“overwhelming” evidence of “bad faith” by Alphapharm 
and found that Mylan engaged in “a host 
of bad faith litigation tactics, which increased the 
burden of this litigation enormously.” The court 
further ruled that an award of the costs associated 
with Takeda's employment of experts “is particularly 
warranted in this case” because the defendants 
knew that their attacks on Takeda's patent “were 
groundless and would only succeed if Takeda did 
not expend the effort and resources necessary to 
shine a light on the flaws in the defendants' arguments.” 


In my view, it is questionable whether that explanation, 
even as supplemented by the court's detailed 
analysis in its sanctions opinion of September 
20, 2006, is sufficient to meet the requirement of a 
satisfactory explanation for invoking the inherent 
authority to award expert witness fees. However, it 
is not necessary to decide that issue in this case, because 
the district court made clear that the amount 
of its overall award did not depend on the award of 
expert witness fees. In its March 21, 2007, opinion, 
the court remarked that Takeda “would certainly be 
fairly entitled to an enhancement of about $3 million, 
with $2 million charged to Mylan and $1 million 
charged to Alphapharm” in light of Takeda's 
success and to “reflect the extensiveness of the misconduct 
here,” which prolonged and increased the 
burden of the litigation on Takeda. Although the 
court did not grant the enhancement, it stated that 
“an enhancement to the lodestar amount will not be 
separately awarded” because “Takeda's expert fees 
are also being awarded.” The court thus made clear

549 F.3d 1381, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1218 

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381) 

that if it were not able to award expert witness fees, 
it would grant the requested enhancement of the attorney 
fees. For that reason, it is clear that the 
award of expert witness fees, even if improper, did 
not result in a greater total fee award than the court 
otherwise would have imposed if it had been limited 
to basing its assessment on section 285 alone. 

FN1 

I therefore concur in this court's action upholding 
the district court's award to Takeda. That said, 
however, I believe it is important to emphasize that 
this case should not be viewed as an invitation for 
district courts to impose “inherent authority” sanctions 
liberally in patent cases, and that such awards, 
even if appropriate in some cases, should be very 
much the exception and not the rule. 

FN1. Several of the expenses included in 
the section 285 award would appear questionable 
as reasonable expenditures necessary 
to the prosecution of the case. Those 
include, for example, “[b]everages while 
waiting at airport,” client dinners, and late 
fees for borrowed books. The appellants 
have not focused on those items in their 
briefs, however, and therefore I would not 
require a remand for a specific justification 
of those expenses.

Nos. 2007-1545, 2008-1162. 
Dec. 1, 2008. 


Background: Patent owner filed action against 
competitor alleging infringement of patents relating 
to video compression technology. The United 
States District Court for the Southern District of 
California, Rudi M. Brewster, Senior District 
Judge, 2007 WL 2261799, granted judgment for 
competitor. Owner appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) owner had been required to disclose its patents 
to joint video team (JVT) standard setting organization 
(SSO) even if it did not submit technical proposal; 
(2) JVT intellectual property right (IPR) policies, 
that referred to IPR information “associated with” 
any standardization proposal or “affecting the use” 
of JVT work, required JVT participants to disclose 
patents that “reasonably might be necessary” to 
practice JVT standard; 
(3) clear and convincing evidence existed that patents 
in suit relating to video compression technology 
“reasonably might be necessary” to practice 
standard for video compression; 
(4) implied waiver could be applied to owner's intentional 
organization of plan to shield its patents 
from consideration by JVT in face of duty to speak; 
(5) competitor could assert equitable estoppel defense 
on appeal even if its pleadings may have been 
deficient in certain respects; 
(6) scope of remedy of unenforceability had to be 
limited to products that were complaint to video 
compression standard; and 

(7) litigation misconduct was sufficient standing 
alone to support exceptional case determination. 
Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

This patent infringement case involves the consequence 
of silence in the face of a duty to disclose 
patents in a standards-setting organization (“SSO”). 
The district court concluded that Qualcomm 
breached its duty to disclose U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,452,104 (“'104 Patent”) and 5,576,767 (“'767 Patent”) 
to the Joint Video Team (“JVT”) SSO. As a 
remedy, the district court ordered the '104 and '767 
Patents (and related patents) unenforceable against 
the world. Additionally, based on both Qualcomm's 
JVT misconduct and its litigation misconduct, the 
court determined that this was an exceptional case 
and awarded Broadcom its attorney fees. For the 
reasons set forth below, we affirm the district 
court's determinations that Qualcomm had a duty to 
disclose the asserted patents to the JVT, that it 
breached this duty, and that the JVT misconduct 
and litigation misconduct were proper bases for the 
court's exceptional case determination. Because the 
scope of the remedy of unenforceability as applying 
to the world was too broad, however, we vacate the 
unenforceability judgment and remand with instructions 
to enter an unenforceability remedy limited in 
scope to H.264-compliant products. Accordingly, 
we affirm-in-part (duty to disclose, breach of duty, 
exceptional case determination), vacate-in-part 
(unenforceability scope), and remand. 

I. BACKGROUND 
This case presents the question of whether 
Qualcomm waived its right to assert its patents by 
failing to disclose them to the JVT SSO. The asserted 
patents relate to video compression technology. 
The '104 Patent issued in 1995 and is entitled, 
“Adaptive Block Size Image Compression Method 
and System.” The ' 767 Patent issued in 1996 and is 
entitled, “Interframe Video Encoding and Decoding 
System.” Chong U. Lee, who was the Vice President 
of Technology at Qualcomm at the time of this 
litigation, is the named inventor of the '104 Patent, 
and he and Donald Pian are the named inventors of

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

the '767 Patent. Qualcomm is the assignee of the 
'104 and '767 Patents. 

In late 2001, the JVT was established as a joint 
project by two parent SSOs: (1) the Video Coding 
Experts Group (“VCEG”) of the International Telecommunication 
Union Telecommunication Standardization 
Sector (“ITU-T”); and (2) the Moving 
Picture Experts Group (“MPEG”) of the International 
Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and 
the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(“IEC”). The JVT was created to develop a single 
“technically aligned, fully interoperable” industry 
standard for video compression technology. Qualcomm 
Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., 539 F.Supp.2d 
1214, 1218 (S.D.Cal.2007) (“ Remedy Order ”) 
(quoting JVT Terms of Reference (“ToR”)). The 
standard developed by the JVT was later named the 

H.264 standard. In May 2003, the ITU-T and ISO/ 
IEC adopted and published the official H.264 
standard. 
*1009 Plaintiff Qualcomm is a member of the 
American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), 
which is the United States representative member 
body in the ISO/IEC, and was an active dues-
paying member for many years prior to 2001. It is 
also a member of the ITU-T and a participant in the 
JVT. Qualcomm did not disclose the '104 and '767 
Patents to the JVT prior to release of the H.264 
standard in May 2003. 

On October 14, 2005, Qualcomm filed the 
present lawsuit against Broadcom in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of 
California, claiming that Broadcom infringed the 
'104 and '767 Patents by making products compliant 
with the H.264 video compression standard. A jury 
trial was held from January 9, 2007, to January 26, 
2007. The jury returned a unanimous verdict as to 
non-infringement and validity, finding that (1) 
Broadcom does not infringe the '104 and '767 Patents; 
and (2) the '104 and '767 Patents were not 
shown to be invalid. The jury also returned a unanimous 
advisory verdict as to the equitable issues, 
finding by clear and convincing evidence that (1) 

the '104 Patent is unenforceable due to inequitable 
conduct; and (2) the '104 and '767 Patents are unenforceable 
due to waiver. 

On March 21, 2007, the district court entered 
an order (1) finding in favor of Qualcomm and 
against Broadcom on Broadcom's counterclaim of 
inequitable conduct as to the '104 Patent; (2) finding 
in favor of Broadcom and against Qualcomm on 
Broadcom's affirmative defense of waiver as to the 
'104 and '767 Patents; and (3) setting a hearing on 
an Order to Show Cause as to the appropriate remedy 
for Qualcomm's waiver. The district court's 
conclusion that Qualcomm waived its rights to assert 
the '104 and '767 Patents was based on Qualcomm's 
conduct before the JVT. 

Throughout discovery, motions practice, trial, 
and even post-trial, Qualcomm adamantly maintained 
that it did not participate in the JVT during 
development of the H.264 standard. Despite numerous 
requests for production and interrogatories requesting 
documents relating to Qualcomm's JVT 
participation prior to adoption of the H.264 standard, 
Qualcomm repeatedly represented to the court 
that it had no such documents or emails. On January 
24, 2007, however, one of the last days of trial, 
a Qualcomm witness testified that she had emails 
that Qualcomm previously claimed did not exist. 
Later that day, Qualcomm produced twenty-one 
emails belonging to that witness. As the district 
court later discovered, these emails were just the 
“tip of the iceberg,” as over two hundred thousand 
more pages of emails and electronic documents 
were produced post-trial. Remedy Order at 1245. 
The district court later determined that these documents 
and emails “indisputably demonstrate that 
Qualcomm participated in the JVT from as early as 
January 2002, that Qualcomm witnesses ... and other 
engineers were all aware of and a part of this 
participation, and that Qualcomm knowingly attempted 
in trial to continue the concealment of 
evidence.” Id. 

On August 6, 2007, after a hearing on the Order 
to Show Cause, the district court entered an Or

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

der on Remedy for Finding of Waiver, ordering the 
'104 and ' 767 Patents (and their continuations, continuations-
in-part, divisions, reissues, and any other 
derivatives thereof) unenforceable against the 
world. The district court concluded: 

In light of all of the ... evidence finally revealed, 
the eventual collapse of Qualcomm's concealment 
efforts exposes the carefully orchestrated plan 
and the deadly determination of Qualcomm to 
achieve its goal of holding hostage the entire industry 
desiring to practice the *1010 H.264 
standard by insulating its IPR from the JVT so 
that the JVT would lose the opportunity to mitigate, 
if not to avoid, Qualcomm's IPR in the development 
of the H.264 standard. Broadcom, ignorant 
of the existence of the '104 and '767 patents, 
designed and is in the process of manufacturing 
numerous H.264-compliant products. 

Remedy Order at 1248. 

On August 6, 2007, the district court also granted 
Broadcom's exceptional case motion, finding 
that this is “an exceptional case by clear and convincing 
evidence based on (1) Qualcomm's bad 
faith participation in the H.264-standard-setting 
body, the Joint Video Team (‘JVT’); and (2) the litigation 
misconduct of Qualcomm through its employees, 
hired outside witnesses, and trial counsel 
during discovery, motions practice, trial, and post-
trial proceedings.” Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom 
Corp., No. 05-CV-1958, 2007 WL 2261799, at *2, 
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57122, at *7 (S.D.Cal. Aug. 
6, 2007) (“ Exceptional Case Order ”). In conjunction 
with the exceptional case order, the district 
court granted Broadcom its attorney fees. 

On October 12, 2007, the magistrate judge held 
a hearing to investigate Qualcomm's litigation misconduct. 
As a sanction, the magistrate judge 
ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom's attorney 
fees, offset by any amount Qualcomm pays associated 
with the exceptional case order. The magistrate 
judge also referred six Qualcomm attorneys to the 
California State Bar for investigation and possible 

sanctions. The magistrate judge further ordered 
Qualcomm and the sanctioned attorneys to participate 
in a comprehensive Case Review and Enforcement 
of Discovery Obligations (“CREDO”) program. 
Qualcomm subsequently paid the sanction 
and participated in the CREDO program. Thereafter, 
the district court vacated the magistrate 
judge's order as to the sanctioned attorneys and remanded 
that portion of the order for further proceedings. 


[1] This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction 
FN1

under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a). 

FN1. Broadcom claims that, as a result of 
Qualcomm's failure to appeal the non-
infringement judgment, we “may dismiss 
this appeal as moot, because it no longer 
presents any case or controversy between 
the parties.” Appellee's Br. 1-2. As Qualcomm 
responds, however, the district 
court's judgment on waiver rendered the 
asserted patents (and all related patents) 
unenforceable against the world, which has 
a broader scope than the judgment of non-
infringement as to the asserted claims and 
the accused products in this case. Thus, 
Qualcomm's failure to appeal the non-
infringement judgment does not moot its 
appeal of the unenforceability judgment.

Inc. (In re Omeprazole Patent Litig.), 483

that an “inequitable conduct claim was not 
technically moot, because it would have 
rendered the entire ... patent unenforceable, 
rather than just the claims that were 
held invalid”). 

II. DISCUSSION 
By failing to disclose relevant intellectual 
property rights (“IPR”) to an SSO prior to the adoption 
of a standard, a “patent holder is in a position 
to ‘hold up’ industry participants from implementing 
the standard. Industry participants who have invested 
significant resources developing products

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

and technologies that conform to the standard will 
find it prohibitively expensive to abandon their investment 
and switch to another standard.” Broad-
com Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 310 
(3d Cir.2007). In order to avoid “patent hold-up,” 
many SSOs require participants to disclose and/or 
give up IPR covering a standard. See Mark A. Lemley, 
Intellectual Property Rights and Standard-Setting 
Organizations, 90 Cal. L.Rev. 1889, 1902 
(2002) (“Because many SSOs want the public to be 
free to use their standard, they will often require 
members to give up any IP protection that covers 
the standard.”). 

*1011 In Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Technologies 
AG, this court considered the question of whether 
the plaintiff, Rambus, had a duty to disclose information 
about patents or patent applications to 
the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council 
(“JEDEC”), which is an SSO associated with the 
Electronic Industries Alliance (“EIA”). 318 F.3d 
1081, 1096 (Fed.Cir.2003). It stated that, “[b]efore 
determining whether Rambus withheld information 
about patents or applications in the face of a duty to 
disclose, this court first must ascertain what duty 
Rambus owed JEDEC.” Id. In determining what 
duty, if any, Rambus owed JEDEC, our court considered 
both the language of the written EIA/JEDEC 
IPR policy and the members' treatment of said 
language. Id. at 1098. It determined that the written 
policy did not impose a direct duty on members expressly 
requiring disclosure of IPR information. Id. 
“Nevertheless, because JEDEC members treated the 
language of [the policy] as imposing a disclosure 
duty, this court likewise treat[ed] this language as 
imposing a disclosure duty.” Id. 

After considering evidence regarding the JEDEC 
members' understanding of the JEDEC policy, 
this court determined that “Rambus's duty to disclose 
extended only to claims in patents or applications 
that reasonably might be necessary to practice 
the standard.” Id. at 1100. Applying that rationale 
to the claims at issue and the evidence in the case, 
it stated that “[t]he record shows that Rambus's 

claimed technology did not fall within the JEDEC 
disclosure duty.” Id. at 1104. Accordingly, this 
court concluded that “substantial evidence does not 
support the jury's verdict that Rambus breached its 
duties under the EIA/JEDEC policy.” Id. at 1105. 

In the present case, the district court considered 
whether Qualcomm had a duty to disclose the '104 
and '767 Patents to the JVT prior to the release of 
the H.264 standard. The district court first analyzed 
the written JVT IPR policies, and concluded that, 
“[s]imilar to Rambus, the JVT IPR Policy and 
Guidelines provide no express requirement to disclose 
patents unless a member submits a technical 
proposal.” Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., No. 
05-CV-1958, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28211, at *34 
(S.D.Cal. Mar. 21, 2007) (“ Waiver Order ”). The 
court continued, “[i]nstead, ‘members/experts are 
encouraged to disclose as soon as possible IPR information 
(of their own or anyone else's) associated 
with any standardization proposal (of their own or 
anyone else's). Such information should be 
provided on a best effort basis.’ ” Id. (quoting JVT 
ToR subsection 3.2). The district court next considered 
the JVT participants' treatment of the JVT 
IPR policies. The district court stated that, 
“[s]imilar to Rambus, despite the language of the 
IPR Policy merely encouraging participants to disclose 
patents to the JVT, the issue before the Court 
is whether JVT participants treated the IPR policy 
as imposing a duty of disclosure.” Id. at *38. The 
district court concluded, like Rambus, that JVT 
members treated the JVT IPR policies as imposing 
a duty of disclosure on participants apart from the 
submission of technical proposals. In order to determine 
whether Qualcomm breached its disclosure 
duty, the district court considered whether the '104 
and '767 Patents “ reasonably might be necessary” 
to practice the H.264 standard. Finally, having concluded 
that the asserted patents fell within the 
“reasonably might be necessary” standard, the district 
court determined that the proper remedy for 
said breach was to order the patents unenforceable 
against the world.

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

This appeal requires that we address the following 
questions relating to the district court's 
judgment: (1) Existence of Disclosure Duty: Did 
Qualcomm, as a participant*1012 in the JVT, have 
a duty to disclose patents to the JVT prior to the release 
of the H.264 standard in May 2003; (2) Scope 
of Disclosure Duty: If so, what was the scope of its 
disclosure duty; (3) Breach: Did Qualcomm breach 
its disclosure duty by failing to disclose the ' 104 
and '767 Patents; and (4) Remedy: If so, was it 
within the district court's equitable authority to 
enter an unenforceability remedy based on the 
equitable defense of waiver in the SSO context? 

A. Existence of Disclosure Duty 
1. Standard of Review 
[2][3] We review questions of law de novo, 
Wang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Elecs. Am., Inc., 103 
F.3d 1571, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1997), and factual findings 
for clear error, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The existence 
of a disclosure duty is a legal question with 
factual underpinnings. See Rambus, 318 F.3d at 
1087 n. 3 (stating that the existence of a disclosure 
duty “may well be a legal question with factual underpinnings”). 
In the present case, one such factual 
underpinning is the JVT participants' understanding 
of the meaning of the JVT IPR policies. 

2. Written Policies 
[4] Determining whether Qualcomm had a duty 
to disclose the '104 and ' 767 Patents to the JVT involves 
two questions. First, we must determine 
whether the written JVT IPR policies impose any 
disclosure obligations on participants (apart from 
the submission of technical proposals). Second, to 
the extent the written JVT IPR policies are ambiguous, 
we must determine whether the JVT participants 
understood the policies as imposing such 
obligations. 
The district court first considered the written 
JVT IPR policies. Specifically, the district court 
considered the JVT ToR, which encompass patent 

FN2

and copyright IPR.As the district court noted, 
the IPR *1013 disclosure provisions of the JVT IPR 
policies apply to Qualcomm, as a member of the 

ITU-T and participant in the JVT. 

FN2. Section 3 of the JVT ToR is entitled 
“IPR Policy & Guidelines.” J.A. 8175. 
Subsection 3.1, entitled “Basic IPR Principles,” 
states that the “JVT has agreed to 
the following basic principles” regarding 
IPR for the JVT codec: 

• The JVT codec should have a simple 
royalty free “baseline” profile (both on 
the encoder and decoder) in order to promote 
the wide implementation and use 
of the JVT codec. All implementations 
should have such a common baseline 
profile core, in order to allow minimal 
interoperability among all JVT codecs. 
The above requirement means that all 
technology applied in the baseline profile 
shall have no IPR, expired IPR, or 
valid but royalty-fee-free IPR (according 
to Box 2.1 or 2.2.1 of the JVT Patent 
Disclosure form, as shown below). 
• Special, more advanced profiles of the 
JVT standard may contain patents per 
Box 2.2 of the JVT Patent Disclosure 
form (reasonable terms and conditions). 
J.A. 8176. 
Subsection 3.2, entitled “Collection of 
IPR information during the standardization 
process,” reads: 

According to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC 
IPR policy, members/experts are encouraged 
to disclose as soon as possible IPR 
information (of their own or anyone 
else's) associated with any standardization 
proposal (of their own or anyone 
else's). Such information should be 
provided on a best effort basis. 

For collecting such information, JVT has 
decided to use it's [sic] own Patent Declaration 
form-note that this is distinct

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

from the ITU ISO IEC Patent Statement 
and Licensing Declaration that is to be 
submitted to the ISO Secretary General 
and ITU TSB Director when the contributed 
technology becomes part of the final 
standard. 

Therefore, JVT requires all technical 
(algorithmic) proposals include the following: 


Attached at the end of each technical 
contribution, a fully filled-out “JVT Patent 
Disclosure form” (as shown below). 
At the contribution stage, this form is for 
information only, and may be signed by 
an expert or left unsigned. The form 
must be included in the contribution to 
JVT. 

Additionally, all submitted source code 
must include a written transfer of copyright 
in the form described in section 5 
below. 

Note that the submission of the JVT Patent 
Disclosure form at the proposal stage 
does not have the same formal status as 
the final IPR declaration to the ITU TSB 
and ISO/IEC, which must be done in the 
approval process for the ITU-T Recommendation 
and ISO/IEC International 
Standard. 

Such information provided to the Chair 
Rapporteur will be tabulated in a “IPR 
status list” (e.g. a simple Word table) of 
the information received. Information 
not currently relevant (e.g. if a proposed 
method was not accepted) will be removed 
from the “IPR status list” as early 
as possible. The “IPR status list” is a living 
document of the JVT. 

Id. (emphases removed). 

As the district court observed, it is clear from a 

review of the JVT IPR policies that identification of 
IPR by JVT participants is critical to the development 
of an effective industry standard. While more 
advanced profiles of the JVT standard may include 
patents on a reasonable terms and conditions basis, 
the goal of the JVT was to develop a royalty free 
“baseline” profile. See J.A. 8176 (“The JVT codec 
should have a simple royalty free ‘baseline’ profile.”). 
The district court recognized that “[t]he nondisclosure 
of a participant's core patents in such a 
program could put the participant in a position in 
which it could literally block the use of the published 
H.264 standard by any company unless the 
company obtained a separate license from the participant.” 
Waiver Order at *60. As previously mentioned, 
however, the district court determined that 
the written JVT IPR policies “provide no express 
requirement to disclose patents unless a member 
submits a technical proposal.” Id. at *34. 

On appeal, the threshold dispute between the 
parties is whether the written JVT IPR policies impose 
any disclosure duty on participants apart from 
the submission of technical proposals. Qualcomm 
argues that the written JVT IPR policies require 
disclosure only when a technical proposal is made, 
and that disclosure is merely encouraged from participants 
not submitting technical proposals. Broad-
com, however, argues that the written policies of 
both the JVT and its parent organizations impose 
disclosure obligations on participants (apart from 
the submission of technical proposals). Additionally, 
Broadcom submits that, to the extent there is 
any ambiguity in the written policies, the understanding 
of the JVT participants controls. 

One of the key inquiries regarding the meaning 
of the written JVT IPR policies centers on the following 
language of subsection 3.2 of the JVT ToR: 
“According to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC IPR policy, 
members/experts are encouraged to disclose as 
soon as possible IPR information (of their own or 
anyone else's) associated with any standardization 
proposal (of their own or anyone else's). Such information 
should be provided on a best effort basis.

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

” J.A. 8176 (emphases added). Pointing to subsection 
3.2, Qualcomm argues that the express language 
of the written JVT policies only requires disclosure 
when a technical proposal is made, and that 
disclosure is merely “encouraged” from participants 
not making technical proposals. Thus, Qualcomm 
argues that the district court erred in holding that 
Qualcomm waived patent rights by breaching an 
“unwritten” JVT disclosure duty. In addition to the 
language of subsection 3.2, Qualcomm points to the 
JVT patent disclosure form, which states: “JVT requires 
that all technical *1014 contributions be accompanied 
with this form. Anyone with knowledge 
of any patent affecting the use of JVT work, of 
their own or any other entity (‘third parties'), is 
strongly encouraged to submit this form as well. ” 

J.A. 8179 (first, third, and fourth emphases added). 
As Broadcom notes, however, subsection 3.2 
expressly incorporates a “best effort[s]” standard. 
Appellee's Br. 36; J.A. 8176 (stating that IPR 
“information should be provided on a best effort 
basis”). When asked at oral argument whether there 
is any evidence in the record that Qualcomm made 
any efforts, let alone best efforts, to disclose IPR 
information associated with any standardization 
proposal, Qualcomm responded, “No, we didn't because 
we did not view that as imposing a duty on 
us.” Oral Arg. at 9:27, available at http:// oralarguments. 
cafc. uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3. 
On rebuttal, Qualcomm clarified this response by 
arguing that the use of best efforts is merely 
“encouraged,” not required. See Oral Arg. at 35:09, 
available at h ttp:// oralarguments.
cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2007-1545.mp3; see 
also Appellant's Br. 25 (“The use of best efforts to 
identify essential patents, like the disclosure thereof, 
is merely encouraged, not required.”). 

We disagree with Qualcomm's reading of subsection 
3.2. While Qualcomm places much emphasis 
on the use of the word “encouraged” in subsection 
3.2, we agree with Broadcom that, when considered 
in light of the relevant context, this language 
applies to the timing of the disclosure (i.e., 

“encouraged to disclose as soon as possible”), not 
the disclosure duty itself. Thus, while the language 
of the JVT IPR policies may not expressly require 
disclosure by all participants in all circumstances 
(e.g., if relevant IPR is not disclosed despite the use 
of best efforts), it at least incorporates a best efforts 
standard (even apart from the submission of technical 
proposals). By Qualcomm's own admission, it 
did not present evidence of any efforts, much less 
best efforts, to disclose patents associated with the 
standardization proposal (of their own or anyone 
else's) to the JVT prior to the release of the H.264 
standard. 

Moreover, in addition to the disclosure obligations 
provided in the JVT IPR policies, Qualcomm 
has disclosure obligations under the rules of the 
JVT parent organizations. Subsection 3.2 of the 
JVT IPR policies states that “the JVT Patent Disclosure 
form at the proposal stage does not have the 
same formal status as the final IPR declaration to 
the ITU TSB and ISO/IEC, which must be done in 
the approval process for the ITU-T Recommendation 
and ISO/IEC International Standard.” J.A. 
8176 (emphasis added). Broadcom submits that the 
“must be done” language in subsection 3.2 is a 
mandatory final approval process requiring all participants 
to make disclosure prior to final approval 
of the standard. Indeed, Broadcom claims that 
Qualcomm made arguments to the trial court that 
should preclude it from arguing on appeal that there 
is not a “must be done” requirement. Specifically, 
Broadcom asserts that, in the following argument to 
the district court, Qualcomm conceded that JVT 
participants had a duty to disclose patents to the 
ISO/IEC and the ITU-T when a standard was approved: 


There's also some requirement language down 
here [in subsection 3.2 of the JVT policy] having 
to do with-there's a must-be-done clause, must be 
done in the approval process. So if you're participating 
when a standard is approved, then you 
have to submit a form to the parent bodies. But as 
I mentioned a moment ago and as I'll get to later,

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

Qualcomm wasn't participating prior to approval, 
so this language didn't apply. 

*1015 J.A. 26421. We now know, however, 
that Qualcomm actually was participating in the 
JVT prior to approval of the H.264 standard. On appeal, 
Qualcomm responds that its trial counsel 
“acknowledged that the ‘must be done’ language is 
mandatory but did not make any representations as 
to the nature of the disclosure duty or what constitutes 
the relevant participation in parent organizations.” 
Appellant's Reply Br. 8 n. 1. Qualcomm's 
trial counsel clearly indicated, however, that its position 
was, “if you're participating when a standard 
is approved, then you have to submit a form to the 
parent bodies.” J.A. 26421. We reject its contrary 
arguments on appeal. 

The rules of the JVT parent organizations 
provide that an ITU-T and ISO/IEC “Patent Statement 
and Licensing Declaration” should be submitted 
separately to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC prior to final 
approval of a standard created by the JVT. Remedy 
Order at 1219. The ITU-T and ISO/IEC patent 
policy provides that “any party participating in the 
work of the ITU, ISO or IEC should” identify patents 
“embodied fully or partly” in a standard under 
consideration. Id. As the district court noted, this 
language applies to Qualcomm as a “party particip


FN3

ating in the work of the ITU, ISO or IEC.” Id. 
In light of the foregoing, we agree with the district 
court that JVT participants also had to disclose patents 
prior to final approval of a standard under the 

FN4

rules of the JVT parent organizations.

FN3. Likewise, Broadcom argues that Section 
2.14.2 of the ISO/IEC Directives applies 
to Qualcomm. Oral Arg. at 24:30, 
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc. 
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3; 
Appellee's Br. 38. Section 2.14.2(a) of the 
ISO/IEC Directives states: 

The originator of a proposal for a document 
shall draw the attention of the committee 
to any patent rights of which the 

originator is aware and considers to cover 
any item of the proposal. Any party 
involved in the preparation of a document 
shall draw the attention of the committee 
to any patent rights of which it 
becomes aware during any stage in the 
development of the document. 

J.A. 11892-93. Broadcom also points to 
the ITU-T policy stating that “the patent 
holder has to provide a written statement 
to be filed at the [Telecommunications 
Standards Bureau] using the ITU-T 
‘Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration’ 
form.” J.A. 11925; Appellee's Br. 
38. At oral argument, Qualcomm argued, 
however, that the ISO/IEC policy does 
not impose any more of a duty than otherwise 
would exist. Oral Arg. at 34:43, 
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc. 
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3. 
FN4. Qualcomm notes that, while it did 
not disclose the '104 and ' 767 Patents to 
the JVT prior to adoption of the H.264 
standard, it did disclose the technology 
covered by the asserted patents to a different 
project, the MPEG Digital Cinema 
project, in late 2001. It also notes that 
“[t]he MPEG disclosure was reviewed by 
[Gary] Sullivan, who subsequently chaired 
the JVT.” Appellant's Br. 45. As Broad-
com responds, however, Qualcomm cannot 
argue that its disclosure to the Digital 
Cinema project satisfies its disclosure duty 
to the JVT. Additionally, Broadcom argues 
that Qualcomm's disclosure to the Digital 
Cinema project shows that there is no 
doubt that Qualcomm knew how to disclose 
these patents when it chose to disclose 
them in the development of another 
standard. We agree with Broadcom. 

In sum, we conclude that Qualcomm, as a par


ticipant in the JVT prior to the release of the H.264 

standard, did have IPR disclosure obligations, as

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

discussed above, under the written policies of both 
the JVT and its parent organizations. 

3. JVT Participants' Understanding of the JVT 
IPR Policies 
[5] Even if we were to read the written IPR 
policies as not unambiguously requiring by themselves 
the aforementioned disclosure obligations, 
our conclusion as to the disclosure obligations of 
JVT participants would nonetheless be the same. 
That is because the language of the JVT *1016 IPR 
policies coupled with the district court's unassailable 
findings and conclusions as to the JVT participants' 
understanding of the policies further establishes 
that the policies imposed disclosure duties on 
participants (apart from the submission of technical 
proposals). As previously discussed, even though 
the Rambus court determined that there was not an 
express disclosure duty in the JEDEC patent policy 
in that case, it treated the policy as imposing a disclosure 
duty because the members treated it as imposing 
a disclosure duty. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1098 
. 
In the present case, while the district court concluded 
that there was no express disclosure requirement 
in the written policies apart from the submission 
of technical proposals, it found “clear and convincing 
evidence that JVT participants treated the 
JVT IPR Policies as imposing a duty to disclose,” 
Waiver Order at *34, and “that Qualcomm was 
aware of this treatment as early as August 2002,” 
prior to the release of the H.264 standard in May 
2003, Remedy Order at 1224. Specifically, the district 
court noted that, “like Rambus, in addition to 
the written guidelines, JVT participants also 
learned of the patent disclosure policy from attendance 
of JVT meetings.” Waiver Order at *34. The 
district court considered witness testimony, including 
testimony from Qualcomm employees, indicating 
that it was the practice of the chairman of the 
JVT, Gary Sullivan, to discuss the JVT IPR policies 
at every meeting. The district court also considered 
testimony indicating that JVT participants sometimes 
submitted disclosures without an accompany


ing technical proposal. 

Qualcomm attempts to distinguish Rambus by 
arguing that the JEDEC patent policy in Rambus 
was silent as to whether members had a disclosure 
duty, while the written JVT IPR policies are 
“unambiguous,” Appellant's Reply Br. 15, and 
“expressly specify disclosure duties only in conjunction 
with a submission,” Appellant's Br. 28. 
Thus, Qualcomm argues that the district court erred 
by inferring a disclosure duty that is “directly contrary 
to the written JVT policy.” Appellant's Br. 26. 
As previously discussed, however, we disagree with 
Qualcomm's interpretation of the written JVT IPR 
policies in the present case. Moreover, even if we 
were to read the written IPR policies as not unambiguously 
requiring by themselves the aforementioned 
disclosure obligations, the disclosure duty 
found by the district court based on the understanding 
of the JVT participants is certainly not “directly 
contrary to the written JVT policy.” Id. 

Having rejected Qualcomm's argument that the 
understanding of JVT participants is contrary to the 
written JVT IPR policies, we are left with reviewing 
the sufficiency of the district court's factual 
finding that JVT participants understood the JVT 
IPR policies as imposing a disclosure duty. Qualcomm 
argues that the evidence relied upon by the 
district court does not support its finding that the 
JVT participants understood the JVT IPR policies 
as imposing a disclosure duty. It asserts that Broad-
com offered no testimony of the other JVT participants 
as to their understanding of the policy. 
Broadcom responds that it offered, inter alia, the 
testimony of Gary Sullivan (the JVT chair) and 
Stephen Gordon (a JVT participant) indicating that 
they understood the patent disclosure duty to be 
mandatory. Qualcomm offers a different interpretation 
of this testimony, as well as the testimony expressly 
relied upon by the district court regarding 
the discussion of the JVT IPR policies at every 
meeting and the submission of disclosures without 
accompanying technical proposals. We are not persuaded, 
however, by Qualcomm's arguments that

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

the district court's findings lacked sufficient evidentiary 
support, or that the evidence should be inter-
preted*1017 differently. The district court was in 
the best position to determine the significance and 
implications of the record testimony in the first instance, 
and the cited testimony provides sufficient 

FN5

evidentiary support for its findings.

FN5. Moreover, while we conclude that 
the district court's findings on this point 
were sufficiently supported by the record, 
we agree with Broadcom that Qualcomm's 
litigation misconduct in this case likely 
prevented Broadcom from obtaining further 
evidence regarding the understanding 
of other JVT participants. 

B. Scope of Disclosure Duty 
[6] Having concluded that Qualcomm, as a participant 
in the JVT prior to release of the H.264 
standard, had a duty to disclose patents, we turn to 
the question of the scope of the disclosure duty. In 
Rambus, although the JEDEC IPR policy did not 
use the language “related to,” the parties consistently 
agreed that the policy required disclosure of 
patents “related to” the standardization work of the 
committee. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1098. The parties 
disagreed, however, in their interpretation of 
“related to.” Id. at 1099. The court considered evidence 
regarding the JEDEC members' understanding 
of the JEDEC policy, and concluded that “Rambus's 
duty to disclose extended only to claims in patents 
or applications that reasonably might be necessary 
to practice the standard.” Id. at 1100. The court 
reasoned that, “[t]o hold otherwise would contradict 
the record evidence and render the JEDEC disclosure 
duty unbounded. Under such an amorphous 
duty, any patent or application having a vague relationship 
to the standard would have to be disclosed.” 
Id. at 1101. The court noted, “[j]ust as lack 
of compliance with a well-defined patent policy 
would chill participation in open standard-setting 
bodies, after-the-fact morphing of a vague, loosely 
defined policy to capture actions not within the actual 
scope of that policy likewise would chill participation 
in open standard-setting bodies.” Id. at 
1102 n. 10. 

In the present case, the district court noted that 
the JVT IPR policies refer to IPR information 
“associated with” any standardization proposal or 
“affecting the use” of JVT work. Waiver Order at 
*27 (citing JVT ToR). Applying the reasoning of 
Rambus, the district court concluded that this language 
requires only that JVT participants disclose 
patents that “reasonably might be necessary” to 
practice the H.264 standard. Id. To hold otherwise, 
the district court explained, “would render the JVT 
disclosure duty inappropriately ‘unbounded,’ 
‘amorphous,’ and ‘vague.’ ” Id. 

On appeal, Qualcomm argues that we should 
reject the district court's formulation of the 
“reasonably might be necessary” standard. Qualcomm 
characterizes the “reasonably might be necessary” 
formulation from Rambus as follows: “it 
must be reasonably clear at the time that the patent 
or application would actually be necessary to practice 
the standard.” Appellant's Reply Br. 20 
(emphasis removed) (citing Rambus, 318 F.3d at 
1100). Thus, according to Qualcomm, when the 
Rambus court explained the standard in terms of 
whether the patent or application “reasonably might 
be necessary” to practice the standard, the court 
really meant that the patent or application must “actually 
be necessary” to practice the standard. Id. 
(emphasis added). Qualcomm submits that “[i]t is 
nonsensical to conceive that an SSO would require 
disclosure to design a standard around a patent 
when the standard does not read on the patent in the 
first place.” Id. at 21-22. 

We disagree with Qualcomm's characterization 
of the standard applied in Rambus. The plain language 
used by the Rambus *1018 court 
(“reasonably might be necessary”) contradicts 
Qualcomm's claim that the Rambus formulation requires 
that a patent must “actually be necessary” in 
order to trigger a disclosure duty. The Rambus 
court explained the “reasonably might be necessary” 
standard by stating that “the disclosure duty

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 16 

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

operates when a reasonable competitor would not 
expect to practice the standard without a license under 
the undisclosed claims.” Rambus, 318 F.3d at 
1100-01. It further clarified that the “reasonably 
might be necessary” standard is an objective standard, 
which “does not depend on a member's subjective 
belief that its patents do or do not read on the 
proposed standard.” Id. at 1104. Likewise, in the 
present case, we agree with the district court that 
the language requires JVT participants to disclose 
patents that “reasonably might be necessary” to 
practice the H.264 standard. This is an objective 
standard, which applies when a reasonable competitor 
would not expect to practice the H.264 standard 
without a license under the undisclosed claims. 
This formulation does not require that the patents 
ultimately must “actually be necessary” to practice 
the H.264 standard. 

C. Breach of Disclosure Duty 
[7] Having concluded that the proper scope of 
the disclosure duty requires JVT participants to disclose 
patents that “reasonably might be necessary” 
to practice the H.264 standard, we next address the 
question of whether Qualcomm breached this disclosure 
duty. It is undisputed that Qualcomm did 
not disclose the '104 and '767 Patents to the JVT 
prior to the release of the H.264 standard. Thus, 
Qualcomm breached its disclosure duty if, as the 
district court found by clear and convincing evidence, 
the '104 and '767 Patents “ reasonably might 
be necessary” to practice the H.264 standard. 
As previously mentioned, the district court 
found clear and convincing evidence that the '104 
and '767 Patents “ reasonably might be necessary” 

FN6

to practice the H.264 standard.In reaching this 
conclusion, the district court relied on the testimony 
from several Qualcomm witnesses. For example, 
the district court relied on testimony from Qualcomm's 
H.264 expert, who testified at trial that “the 
claims of the ['104] patent map onto the H.264 
standard, so that devices or systems that practice 

H.264 actually practice claims of the 104 patent.” 
Waiver Order at *41. Additionally, inter alia, the 
district court relied on an email from a Qualcomm 
employee discussing the coverage of the '767 Patent, 
and describing it as a “core patent relevant to 
H.264.” Id. at *42. 

FN6. The district court refers to the standard 
in terms of “reasonably might be necessary,” 
“reasonably may be necessary,” 
and “reasonably may be essential.” Compare 
Waiver Order at *26 (“reasonably 
may be necessary”), *27 (“reasonably 
might be necessary”), and *40 
(“reasonably may be essential”). We will 
refer to the standard in the terms used by 
the Rambus court, “reasonably might be 
necessary,” for consistency. 

Qualcomm argues that the finding of non-
infringement here refutes any finding that it 
breached a disclosure duty. Broadcom responds, 
however, that it is inconsistent for Qualcomm to 
now argue that the asserted patents do not meet the 
“reasonably might be necessary” standard, when 
Qualcomm accused Broadcom's products of infringement 
in this case solely because they practiced 
the H.264 standard. Broadcom also points to 
testimony of Qualcomm's own JVT participants in 
support of its claim that JVT participants considered 
that the asserted patents “reasonably might 
be necessary” to practice the H.264 standard. 

*1019 On appeal, Qualcomm does not present 
any arguments comparing the asserted claims to the 

H.264 standard in an attempt to show that they do 
not meet the “reasonably might be necessary” formulation. 
Indeed, Broadcom argues that if Qualcomm 
truly believes that the asserted patents do not 
meet the “reasonably might be necessary” standard, 
then it necessarily lacked a Rule 11 basis to bring 
this litigation in the first place. Appellee's Br. 48 
(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (“By presenting to the court 
a pleading ... an attorney ... certifies that ... (2) the 
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are 
warranted by existing law ... [and] (3) the factual 
contentions have evidentiary support....”)).

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

We are not persuaded by Qualcomm's arguments 
on this point, and are unable to reconcile its 
ex post argument that the asserted patents do not 
meet the “reasonably might be necessary” standard 
with its ex ante arguments regarding infringement. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district 
court did not err in finding clear and convincing 
evidence that the '104 and ' 767 Patents fell 
within the “reasonably might be necessary” standard. 
Thus, the district court properly determined 
that Qualcomm breached its disclosure duty by failing 
to disclose the '104 and '767 Patents to the JVT 
prior to the release of the H.264 standard in May 
2003. 

Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether 
it was within the district court's equitable authority 
to enter an unenforceability remedy in this case. 

D. Equitable Remedies 
[8] The district court analyzed the consequence 
of Qualcomm's failure to disclose the '104 and '767 
Patents under the framework of waiver as a consequence 
of silence in the face of a duty to speak. 
The parties disagree on whether waiver was the appropriate 
equitable framework, and whether the 
scope of the unenforceability remedy was within 
the district court's equitable authority. 
1. Standard of Review 
[9][10] We review a district court's judgment 
on the equitable defense of waiver for an abuse of 
discretion. See A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides 
Constr. Co., 960 F.2d 1020, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1992) 
(en banc) (“As equitable defenses, laches and equitable 
estoppel are matters committed to the sound 
discretion of the trial judge and the trial judge's decision 
is reviewed by this court under the abuse of 
discretion standard.”). We review issues of law involved 
in the district court's waiver judgment de 
novo. See Wang Labs., 103 F.3d at 1581. As this 
court has previously explained, we “may set aside a 
discretionary decision if the decision rests on an erroneous 
interpretation of the law or on clearly erroneous 
factual underpinnings. If such error is absent, 
the determination can be overturned only if the trial 

court's decision represents an unreasonable judgment 
in weighing relevant factors.” A.C. Aukerman, 
960 F.2d at 1039. 

2. Waiver 
First, we address the question of whether 
waiver was the appropriate equitable doctrine to apply 
in this case. Qualcomm argues that the district 
court's findings do not constitute waiver as a matter 
of law. It argues that “true waiver” requires a voluntary 
or intentional relinquishment of a known 
right. 

Specifically, Qualcomm claims that the district 
court's findings in this case run directly contrary to 
any claim that Qualcomm intended to voluntarily 
waive its patent rights. On this point, we agree with 
Qualcomm. The following finding by the district 
court certainly suggests that *1020 Qualcomm did 
not intend to waive its patent rights: 

The Court FINDS by clear and convincing evidence 
that Qualcomm intentionally organized a 
plan of action to shield the '104 and '767 patents 
from consideration by the JVT with the anticipation 
that (1) the resulting H.264 standard would 
infringe those patents and (2) Qualcomm would 
then have an opportunity to be an indispensable 
licensor to anyone in the world seeking to produce 
an H.264-compliant product. 

Remedy Order at 1227. Therefore, rather than 
establishing that Qualcomm intentionally relinquished 
its rights, the district court's findings 
demonstrate that Qualcomm intentionally organized 
a plan to shield its patents from consideration by 
the JVT, intending to later obtain royalties from 
H.264-compliant products. Thus, in these circumstances, 
it appears that “true waiver” is not the appropriate 
framework. 

As Broadcom notes, however, the district 
court's formulation of the law of waiver was not 
limited to “true waiver,” but also addressed 
“implied waiver.” Appellee's Br. 55. The district 
court's advisory jury instruction stated:

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

In order to prove waiver, Broadcom must show 
by clear and convincing evidence either that 
Qualcomm, with full knowledge of the material 
facts, intentionally relinquished its rights to enforce 
the 104 and 767 patents or that its conduct 
was so inconsistent with an intent to enforce its 
rights as to induce a reasonable belief that such 
right has been relinquished. 

Waiver Order at *32-33 (emphasis added). 
Broadcom submits that “[t]he second element of 
that instruction correctly states the long-established 
doctrine of implied waiver.” Appellee's Br. 55. 

Qualcomm responds that “[e]ven if a duty to 
disclose had been breached, this breach is best explained 
as negligence, oversight, or thoughtlessness, 
which does not create a waiver.” Appellant's 
Br. 52 (quotations omitted). In the present case, 
however, the district court found clear and convincing 
evidence that Qualcomm knew that the asserted 
patents “reasonably might be necessary” to 
practice that H.264 standard, and that it intentionally 
did not disclose them to the JVT. These findings 
demonstrate much more than “negligence, 
oversight, or thoughtlessness.” 

As to implied waiver, Qualcomm argues that, 
“even if Broadcom had proven an intentional 
breach of the JVT disclosure duty, waiver could be 
inferred only if Qualcomm knew that nondisclosure 
alone would (with no detrimental reliance by any 
party) necessarily result in the loss of those rights.” 
Appellant's Br. 52. While Qualcomm argues that 
implied waiver requires that a party have knowledge 
that its actions would “necessarily” result in 
the loss of rights, the case that Qualcomm cites as 
support for this argument states that “[w]here 
waivers are permissible, they are often enforced 
only if the waiver was knowing or intelligent, 
which means the individual has sufficient awareness 
of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences 
of his decision.” Clark v. Capital Credit 
& Collection Servs., 460 F.3d 1162, 1170-71 (9th 
Cir.2006) (quotations and citations omitted). The 
Clark case also makes clear that waiver depends on 

the right at issue. There was a different right at issue 
in Clark, based on a different statutory scheme, 
in a much different context than the present case. 
Thus, we are not convinced that the Clark analysis 
is particularly helpful here. Additionally, we note 
that the district court's findings in the present case-
including that Qualcomm knew JVT participants 
treated the JVT policies as imposing a duty, that it 
knew the asserted patents “reasonably might be 
*1021 necessary” to practice the H.264 standard, 
and that it intentionally shielded the patents from 
consideration by the JVT-demonstrate that Qualcomm 
had sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances. 
Moreover, even if Qualcomm did not 
know that the asserted patents would “necessarily” 
be held unenforceable as a result of a breach of its 
disclosure duty, we conclude that alone would not 
shield it from the application of implied waiver in 
the SSO context where the district court found intentional 
nondisclosure in the face of a duty to 

FN7

speak.

FN7. Indeed, as previously mentioned, 
here the district court found clear and convincing 
evidence that 

Qualcomm intentionally organized a 
plan of action to shield the '104 and ' 767 
patents from consideration by the JVT 
with the anticipation that (1) the resulting 
H.264 standard would infringe those 
patents and (2) Qualcomm would then 
have an opportunity to be an indispensable 
licensor to anyone in the world 
seeking to produce an H.264-compliant 
product. 

Remedy Order at 1227. 

Qualcomm also argues that any “nondisclosure 
did not cause any harm to Broadcom or any other 
entity.” Appellant's Br. 55. Qualcomm submits that 
there is no harm because (1) “the jury's non-
infringement verdict conclusively establishes” that 
the asserted patents are not needed to produce 
H.264-compliant products, and (2) even if the as

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

serted patents were needed to practice the H.264 
standard, Qualcomm would be willing to license 
them. Appellant's Br. 56. We disagree. Even if 
Qualcomm agreed not to pursue an injunction in 
this case, injunctions are not the only type of harm. 
Forcing a party to accept a license and pay 
whatever fee the licensor demands, or to undergo 
the uncertainty and cost of litigation (which in this 
case was substantial), are significant burdens. 

Qualcomm further argues that “[t]he district 
court never found detrimental reliance by Broad-
com because of its misconception that such reliance 
is not an element of a defense premised on conduct 
that allegedly is objectively misleading to a reasonable 
person.” Appellant's Reply Br. 25. In essence, 
it appears that Qualcomm wants to benefit from its 
intentional nondisclosure of the asserted patents by 
arguing that Broadcom cannot succeed on an implied 
waiver defense without specific findings as to 
detrimental reliance by Broadcom. 

We disagree with Qualcomm's contention that 
the district court's findings in this case were insufficient 
to support the application of an implied 
waiver defense. The district court found that JVT 
participants understood the JVT IPR policies as imposing 
a disclosure duty, that Qualcomm participated 
in the JVT prior to release of the H.264 standard, 
and that Qualcomm was silent in the face of its 
disclosure duty. Indeed, the district court stated that 
“participants in the JVT project shared the aims and 
policies of the JVT and considered themselves obligated 
to identify IPR owned or known by them, 
whether or not they made technical proposals for 
study.” Waiver Order at *60. As the district court 
noted, “Broadcom, ignorant of the existence of the 
'104 and ' 767 patents, designed and is in the process 
of manufacturing numerous H.264-compliant 
products.” Remedy Order at 1248. In light of the record 
in this case in its entirety, it would be improper 
to allow Qualcomm to rely on the effect of its 
misconduct to shield it from the application of the 

FN8

equitable defense of implied waiver.

FN8. We note that Qualcomm argues that 

“Broadcom's conception of waiver would 
swallow the law of equitable estoppel.” 
Appellant's Reply Br. 24. While equitable 
estoppel may generally be an appropriate 
legal framework for analysis of breaches of 
disclosure duties in the SSO context, as 
Broadcom points out, that does not preclude 
the same underlying conduct from 
satisfying the defense of implied waiver. 
As previously discussed, the district court's 
findings in this case as to Qualcomm's intentional 
nondisclosure in the face of a 
duty to speak fully support the application 
of implied waiver. 

*1022 [11] In sum, we agree with the district 
court that, “[a] duty to speak can arise from a group 
relationship in which the working policy of disclosure 
of related intellectual property rights (‘IPR’) is 
treated by the group as a whole as imposing an obligation 
to disclose information in order to support 
and advance the purposes of the group.” Waiver 
Order at *19-20. Not only did the district court find 
that Qualcomm was silent in the face of a disclosure 
duty in the SSO context, it also found clear and 
convincing evidence that Qualcomm had knowledge, 
prior to the adoption of the H.264 standard in 
May 2003, that the JVT participants understood the 
policies as imposing a disclosure duty, that the asserted 
patents “reasonably might be necessary” to 
practice the H.264 standard, and that Qualcomm intentionally 
organized a plan to shield said patents 
from consideration by the JVT, planning to demand 
license fees from those seeking to produce 
H.264-compliant products. Then, after participating 
in the JVT and shielding the asserted patents from 
consideration during development of the H.264 
standard, Qualcomm filed a patent infringement 
lawsuit against Broadcom, alleging infringement 
primarily, if not solely, based on Broadcom's H.264 
compliance. In these circumstances, we conclude 
that it was within the district court's authority, sitting 
as a court of equity, to determine that Qualcomm's 
misconduct falls within the doctrine of 
waiver.

3. Equitable Estoppel 
[12] There remains the question of whether, 
even if implied waiver did not apply here, Qualcomm's 
conduct falls within another equitable doc-
trine-equitable estoppel. Indeed, Qualcomm argues 
that equitable estoppel, rather than waiver, in appropriate 
circumstances is the proper remedy for 
breach of SSO disclosure duties. Appellant's Br. 54 
(“This Court and others have recognized that equitable 
estoppel, in appropriate circumstances, is the 
proper defense when patent disclosure obligations 
to SSOs are breached.”). Qualcomm claims that 
Broadcom chose not to pursue equitable estoppel at 
trial, however, and is foreclosed from raising equitable 
estoppel on appeal because it did not cross-
appeal the preclusion of that defense. We disagree. 
At oral argument, Qualcomm's counsel asserted 
that Broadcom cannot now press an equitable estoppel 
defense because it “chose as a tactical matter 
to pursue this as a matter of waiver and not as a 
matter of equitable estoppel.” Oral Arg. at 6:35, 
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc. uscourts. 
gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3. Broadcom responded, 
however, by noting that it attempted to raise 
equitable estoppel as a defense at the trial court, but 
Qualcomm opposed the addition of this defense, asserting 
that there is no legal or factual basis for the 
application of equitable estoppel in this case. 
Broadcom argues, “Qualcomm cannot withhold 
evidence of its JVT participation, successfully oppose 
Broadcom's equitable estoppel defense making 
false factual assertions about its JVT participation, 
and then complain that its JVT misconduct is more 
amenable to an equitable estoppel defense than a 
waiver defense.” Appellee's Br. 57. 

In its answer to the complaint, Broadcom included 
the equitable defenses of waiver, laches, and 
“other applicable equitable doctrines.” Qualcomm 
then incorrectly*1023 asserted throughout discovery 
that it never participated in the JVT. As a result 
of Broadcom's investigation, however, it discovered 
a single publicly available document-a December 
2002 membership list for a JVT subcommittee in


cluding the email address of a Qualcomm employee-
indicating that Qualcomm had indeed participated 
in the JVT prior to the release of the H.264 
standard. Broadcom then submitted an interrogatory 
answer contending that Qualcomm is barred by, 
inter alia, the doctrines of equitable estoppel and 
implied license. Qualcomm subsequently moved for 
summary judgment on Broadcom's defenses of 
waiver, equitable estoppel, and implied license. In 
support of its summary judgment motion, Qualcomm 
argued that Broadcom did not sufficiently 
plead equitable estoppel or implied license, but 
even if it had there is no basis for these defenses 
because Qualcomm did not participate in the JVT 
prior to the release of the H.264 standard. Remedy 
Order at 1240 (noting that Qualcomm's motion for 
summary judgment stated, “[t]he facts are undisputed: 
QUALCOMM employees never participated, 
in any form, in the JVT until after the H.264 standard 
was already released,” and, “[t]here is no evidence 
that any QUALCOMM participant knew of 
the applicability of the patents-in-suit to the H.264 
standard prior to the initiation of this lawsuit”). 
Thus, Qualcomm represented to the district court 
that there was no basis for equitable estoppel or implied 
license because there was no basis for them in 
the facts and because they were insufficiently pled. 

Broadcom submits that “if Qualcomm had produced 
during discovery the 46,000 documents 
showing its participation in the JVT, the district 
court would almost surely have permitted Broad-
com to amend its answer to assert equitable estoppel, 
as Broadcom was permitted to do when new 
evidence of inequitable conduct came to light.” Appellee's 
Br. 56-57. We agree with Broadcom that 
Qualcomm cannot withhold evidence of its JVT 
participation, make false factual assertions about 
this participation to the district court in opposition 
to Broadcom's equitable estoppel defense, and then 
argue on appeal that Broadcom failed to sufficiently 
plead equitable estoppel. Surely Qualcomm cannot 
expect to benefit by concealing documents, misrepresenting 
facts throughout trial, and then claiming 
ex post that Broadcom should have raised a similar

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

equitable doctrine earlier. Although Broadcom's 
pleadings may have been deficient in certain respects, 
such deficiencies were caused, in significant 
measure, by Qualcomm's failure to disclose its participation 
in the H.264 standard-setting process. 
Under such extraordinary circumstances, any deficiencies 
in Broadcom's pleadings should not permit 
Qualcomm to escape the consequences of its malfeasance. 


[13] We also reject Qualcomm's argument that 
Broadcom cannot rely on equitable estoppel in this 
case because Broadcom did not cross-appeal the 
district court's preclusion of that defense. A cross-
appeal would be improper here because the alternative 
doctrine of equitable estoppel would not enlarge 
the judgment relative to the doctrine of waiver 
relied upon by the district court. See Voda v. Cordis 
Corp., 536 F.3d 1311, 1324 n. 4 (Fed.Cir.2008) 
(stating that “where an argument is merely an alternative 
basis to support a judgment of infringement, 
it is not a proper basis for cross-appeal and 
should be dismissed”); Howmedica Osteonics Corp. 

v. Wright Med. Tech., Inc., 540 F.3d 1337, 1343 n. 
2 (Fed.Cir.2008) (noting that the court “dismissed 
[a party's] cross-appeal as improper because it did 
not seek to enlarge the judgment but merely asserted 
an alternative ground to affirm the judgment”). 
Thus, Broadcom properly raised equitable *1024 
estoppel as an alternative ground to uphold the 
judgment, rather than a cross-appeal. 
Broadcom submits: 

If this Court determines that Broadcom's waiver 
defense should have been in the form of equitable 
estoppel, the proper remedy is to remand to the 
district court with instructions to amend the 
pleadings to conform to the evidence pursuant to 
Rule 15(b), or, alternatively, remand to the district 
court with instructions to reinstate Broad-
com's equitable estoppel defense, to reopen discovery 
on Qualcomm's JVT misconduct, and to 
conduct a separate hearing on that defense. 

Appellee's Br. 57 n. 16. We agree with Broad-

com that it is entitled to a remand with respect to 
equitable estoppel. However, because of our conclusion 
with respect to waiver, a remand to address 
equitable estoppel is not necessary here. 

4. Unenforceability Remedy 
[14] In its March 21, 2007 order, after finding 
that Qualcomm waived its rights to enforce the asserted 
patents against H.264 products by silence in 
the face of a disclosure duty, the district court discussed 
the proper remedy to apply in this case. The 
district court was unable to find guidance for an 
equitable remedy of waiver by a patentee, but it 
noted that “[i]nequitable conduct by an inventor 
and his/her agents before the PTO may result in a 
decree of unenforceability of the patent, but the 
remedy depends on equitable considerations arising 
from the circumstances involved.” Waiver Order at 
*61. The court reasoned that an equitable remedy to 
a finding of waiver should not be automatic; rather, 
it should be fashioned to give a fair, just and equitable 
response reflective of the offending conduct. 
Id. at *62. In light of this, the district court considered 
the extent of the materiality of the withheld 
information and the circumstances of the nondisclosure 
relating to the JVT proceedings. Id. 
The district court noted that the “theoretical 
remedies that appear vary from total unenforceability 
of the patents to no sanction of any kind.” Id. 
The court stated: 

The Court sees the obvious connection between 
the '104 and '767 patents and H.264 compliant 
products. Therefore, the Court is inclined to consider 
a remedy consisting of (1) independent unenforceability 
of the '104 and '767 patents against 
any H.264 compliant products, and (2) inclusion 
of the '104 and '767 patents in the MPEG LA patent 
pool, which receives royalties from H.264 
compliant producers that are divided between all 
owners of patents related to the H.264 standard 
who are members of the pool. 

Id. at *62-63. The court did not decide which 
remedy to apply in its March 21, 2007 order. In

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

stead, it scheduled an Order to Qualcomm to Show 
Cause why it should not order the aforementioned 
remedy. Id. at *63. 

On August 6, 2007, after a hearing on the Order 
to Show Cause, the district court entered an Order 
on Remedy for Finding of Waiver, ordering the 
'104 and ' 767 Patents (and their continuations, continuations-
in-part, divisions, reissues, and any other 
derivatives thereof) unenforceable against the 
world. In reaching this conclusion, the district court 
rejected Qualcomm's argument that Broadcom may 
not have any remedies beyond itself, because it 
raised waiver as an affirmative defense rather than 
as a counterclaim or cross-claim. The district court 
noted that this court has upheld the unenforceability 
of a patent to the world due to inequitable conduct 
even when pled as an affirmative *1025 defense. 
Remedy Order at 1217 (citing McKesson Info. Solutions, 
Inc. v. Bridge Med., Inc., 487 F.3d 897, 908, 
926 (Fed.Cir.2007); Semiconductor Energy Lab. 
Co. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 204 F.3d 1368, 1372, 
1378 (Fed.Cir.2000); Refac Int'l, Ltd. v. Lotus Dev. 
Corp., 81 F.3d 1576, 1578, 1585 (Fed.Cir.1996)). 

Qualcomm argues that the remedy of unenforceability 
entered on Broadcom's defense of 
waiver is contrary to law. It submits that once the 
jury returned a non-infringement verdict the district 
court lacked any legal basis to consider the affirmative 
defense of waiver. It appears to base this argument 
largely on the fact that Broadcom pled waiver 
only as an affirmative defense, as opposed to a 
counterclaim. Thus, Qualcomm argues that, because 
waiver was pled as an affirmative defense, it 
cannot result in a judgment of unenforceability. We 
disagree. It was entirely appropriate for the district 
court to address the defense of waiver after the jury 
returned a non-infringement verdict. As the district 
court noted, this court has upheld judgments of unenforceability 
based on inequitable conduct even 
where pled as an affirmative defense. We see no 
reason why an affirmative defense of waiver cannot 
similarly result in a judgment of unenforceability. 

[15] Broadcom also submits that “[t]he district 
court, sitting in equity, had the authority to grant relief 
as a result of Qualcomm's conduct.” Appellee's 
Br. 57. By analogy, it claims that successful assertion 
of the defenses of inequitable conduct, equitable 
estoppel, and patent misuse has resulted in unenforceability 
judgments. In response to Broad-
com's analogy to inequitable conduct, Qualcomm 
argues “the rationale for a remedy of unenforceability 
for inequitable conduct before the PTO-that 
such conduct taints the property right ab initio-is 
simply not present for waiver based on post-PTO 
conduct before a private SSO.” Appellant's Reply 
Br. 27. In response to the patent misuse analogy, 
Qualcomm states that “[w]hen patent misuse is 
proven, a court may temporarily suspend the own-
er's ability to enforce the patent while the improper 
practice and its effects remain ongoing.” Id. 

[16][17] In addition to the analogy to inequitable 
conduct, we find the remedy of unenforceability 
based on post-issuance patent misuse instructive 
in this case. As Qualcomm notes, the successful assertion 
of patent misuse may render a patent unenforceable 
until the misconduct can be purged; it 
does not render the patent unenforceable for all 
time. Appellant's Reply Br. 27. In B. Braun Medical, 
Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, this court stated: 

[T]he patent misuse doctrine is an extension of 
the equitable doctrine of unclean hands, whereby 
a court of equity will not lend its support to enforcement 
of a patent that has been misused. Patent 
misuse arose, as an equitable defense available 
to the accused infringer, from the desire to 
restrain practices that did not in themselves violate 
any law, but that drew anticompetitive 
strength from the patent right, and thus were 
deemed to be contrary to public policy. When 
used successfully, this defense results in rendering 
the patent unenforceable until the misuse is 
purged.

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

misuse renders the patent unenforceable until the 
misuse is purged; it does not, of itself, invalidate 
the patent.”). In light of the foregoing, we agree 
with Qualcomm that patent misuse does not render 
a patent unenforceable for all time. Contrary to 
Qualcomm's arguments, however, the limited*1026 
scope of unenforceability in the patent misuse context 
does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that 
an unenforceability remedy is unavailable in the 
waiver context in the present case. Instead, we conclude 
that a district court may in appropriate circumstances 
order patents unenforceable as a result 
of silence in the face of an SSO disclosure duty, as 
long as the scope of the district court's unenforceability 
remedy is properly limited in relation to the 
underlying breach. 

[18][19] While the scope of an unenforceability 
remedy in the patent misuse context is limited to 
rendering the patent unenforceable until the misuse 
is purged, the scope of the district court's unenforceability 
remedy in the present case was not limited 
in relation to Qualcomm's misconduct in the 
SSO context. The basis for Broadcom's waiver defense 
was Qualcomm's conduct before the JVT during 
development of the H.264 standard, including 
intentional nondisclosure of patents that it knew 
“reasonably might be necessary” to practice the 
standard. The district court correctly recognized 
that the remedy for waiver in the SSO context 
should not be automatic, but should be fashioned to 
give a fair, just, and equitable response reflective of 
the offending conduct. In determining the appropriate 
equitable remedy in this case, the district court 
properly considered the extent of the materiality of 
the withheld information and the circumstances of 
the nondisclosure relating to the JVT proceedings. 
While we agree with the district court that there is 
an “obvious connection between the '104 and '767 
patents and H.264 compliant products,” we do not 
discern such a connection between the asserted patents 
and products that are not H.264-compliant, and 
neither party points us to any such connection. 
Waiver Order at *62. 

Accordingly, based on the district court's findings, 
the broadest permissible unenforceability remedy 
in the circumstances of the present case would 
be to render the '104 and '767 Patents (and their 
continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, 
and any other derivatives thereof) unenforceable 
against all H.264-compliant products 
(including the accused products in this case, as well 
as any other current or future H.264-compliant 
products). Accordingly, we vacate the unenforceability 
remedy and remand with instructions to enter 
an unenforceability remedy limited in scope to any 
H.264-compliant products. 

E. Exceptional Case Determination 
[20][21][22] Under 35 U.S.C. § 285, a district 
court “in exceptional cases may award reasonable 
attorney fees to the prevailing party.” An exceptional-
case finding must be established by clear and 
convincing evidence. Forest Labs., Inc. v. Abbott 
Labs., 339 F.3d 1324, 1327 (Fed.Cir.2003). In review 
of a § 285 exceptional case determination, we 
review the district court's underlying factual findings 
for clear error and its legal conclusions without 
deference. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1088. The district 
court's determination of the award appropriate in an 
exceptional case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. 
Id. 

[23] Finding that Broadcom established this to 
be an exceptional case by clear and convincing 
evidence, the district court awarded Broadcom its 
attorney fees. As both parties agree, the district 
court based its § 285 exceptional case determination 
both on Qualcomm's (1) “bad faith participation” 
in the JVT, and (2) “litigation misconduct ... 
during discovery, motions practice, trial, and post-
trial proceedings.” Exceptional Case Order at *7. 
Qualcomm argues that the district court's award 
of attorney fees associated *1027 with the exceptional 
case determination must be vacated because 
it is based in part on Qualcomm's JVT-related 
activities. First, Qualcomm claims that the JVT 
misconduct findings are clear error. Second, Qualcomm 
argues that a patentee's bad-faith business

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004) 

conduct toward an accused infringer prior to litigation 
does not warrant a finding of exceptionality, 
and that at a minimum we should vacate and remand 
for the district court to reform the award to 
excise the JVT-misconduct findings. 

[24] First, the district court's JVT findings are 
not clear error. The district court was in the best position 
to determine the significance and implications 
of the record testimony in the first instance, 
and the cited testimony provides ample evidentiary 
support for its findings regarding JVT misconduct. 
For example, in support of its JVT misconduct findings, 
the district court relied upon emails between 
Qualcomm employees suggesting “extending” 
Qualcomm's patents in order to cover the standard 
being developed by the JVT. Remedy Order at 
1228. The district court also relied upon emails 
suggesting “monitoring” the JVT “from a distance” 
and refraining from making any submissions, which 
would include patent disclosures, to a JVT parent 
body. Id. The district court discussed these and 
many other pieces of evidence relating to the JVT 
misconduct in detail in its opinions. We are not persuaded 
by Qualcomm's claim that the cited evidence 
was insufficient. 
Second, as previously discussed, the district 
court found clear and convincing evidence that 
Qualcomm intentionally organized a plan of action 
to shield the '104 and '767 Patents from consideration 
by the JVT with the anticipation that it would 
then have the opportunity to become an indispensable 
licensor to anyone in the world seeking to produce 
H.264-compliant products. The district court's 
litigation misconduct findings-which were based on 
the repeated false claims during discovery, trial, 
and post-trial, by Qualcomm's attorneys and witnesses 
that Qualcomm did not participate in the 
JVT in the development of the H.264 standard-
represented the culmination of this plan. Qualcomm 
is correct that this court has refused to uphold an 
exceptional case award “based on a patentee's bad-
faith business conduct toward an accused infringer 
prior to litigation.” Forest Labs. 339 F.3d at 1329. 

In our view, the litigation misconduct findings were 
sufficient standing alone to support the exceptional 
case determination here, and in the circumstances 
of the present case it was not error for the district 
court to additionally consider the related JVT misconduct, 
which was an important predicate to understanding 
and evaluating the litigation misconduct. 


III. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing analysis, we agree with 
the district court that Qualcomm had a duty to disclose 
the asserted patents to the JVT, that it 
breached its disclosure duty, and that Broadcom 
was entitled to an award of attorney fees associated 
with the court's exceptional case determination. Because 
the scope of the remedy of unenforceability 
as applying to the world was too broad, however, 
we vacate the unenforceability judgment and remand 
with instructions to narrow the scope of unenforceability 
to H.264-compliant products. Accordingly, 
we affirm-in-part (duty to disclose, 
breach of duty, exceptional case determination), vacate-
in-part (unenforceability scope), and remand.

DBC, LLC (“DBC”) appeals from a final decision 
of the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
(“the Board”), which affirmed the examiner's rejection 
of all pending claims as obvious under 35 

U.S.C. § 103. Ex parte DBC, No.2007-1907, 2007 
WL 2433106 (B.P.A.I. Aug. 24, 2007) (“ Decision 
”). Because substantial evidence supports the 
Board's determination that the claims would have 
been obvious, and because DBC has waived challenging 
the appointment of the administrative patent 
judges who presided over its appeal, we affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
This case involves juice made from the fruit of 
the mangosteen tree (known scientifically as the 
Garcinia mangostana L. *1376 tree), an exotic 
plant thought to originate from Southeast Asia. The 
mangosteen fruit, which is botanically unrelated to 
the mango, is reputed to be one of the best tasting 
of all tropical fruits. U.S. Patent No. 6,730,333 
(“the '333 patent”), col. 1, ll. 22-23. The '333 patent 
states that the pericarp or rind of the mangosteen 
fruit-although very bitter-is known in folk medicine 
to treat conditions such as intestinal and skin ailments. 
Id., col. 1, ll. 33-34, 48-53. As a result of its 
use in folk medicine, the medicinal properties of 
the mangosteen tree have been studied in numerous 
pharmacological and clinical studies. Id., col. 1, l. 
58-col. 2, l. 18. According to the patent, these studies 
have isolated in the mangosteen tree and its fruit 
chemical constituents known as xanthones, biologically 
active compounds that are receiving increased 
attention as potentially able to provide a 
variety of health benefits. Id. 

DBC is the owner of the '333 patent, which issued 
on May 4, 2004. The patent is directed to a 
“nutraceutical composition[ ] comprising a mixture 

of the pulp and pericarp of the mangosteen fruit.” 
Id., col. 1, ll. 11-13. A nutraceutical is defined in 
the patent as “any compound[ ] or chemical[ ] that 
can provide dietary or health benefits when consumed 
by humans or animals.” Id., col. 3, ll. 59-61. 
Claim 1 is representative of the invention: 

1. A nutraceutical beverage comprising: 
pericarp from fruit of a Garcinia mangostana 

L. tree; a first juice from fruit of a Garcinia 
mangostana L. tree; and at least one second 
juice selected from the group consisting of fruit 
juice and vegetable juice. 
On October 14, 2004, the United States Patent 
and Trademark Office (“PTO”) granted a third 
party's request for ex parte reexamination of the ' 
333 patent. During reexamination, the examiner rejected 
all claims of the '333 patent as obvious over 
a combination of seven prior art references: (1) Japanese 
Patent 11043442 (“JP '442”); (2) Japanese 
Patent 08208501 (“JP '501”); (3) James A. Duke & 
Judith L. duCellier, CRC Handbook of Alternative 
Cash Crops (1993) (“Duke”); (4) J.F. Caius, The 
Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of India (1986); 

(5) Keigo Nakatani et al., Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase 
and Prostaglandin ESynthesis by

<<gamma>>-mangostin, a Xanthone Derivative in 
Mangosteen, in c6 Rat Glioma Cells, 63 Biochemical 
Pharmacology 73 (2002); (6) K.R. Kirtikar & 

B.D. Basu, Indian Medicinal Plants (1999); and (7) 
Othman Yaacob & H.D. Tindall, Mangosteen Cultivation 
(1995) (“Yaacob”). Of these seven references, 
JP '442 was the only reference not before the 
original examiner who found the claims of the '333 
patent application patentable. 
In response to the examiner's rejection of the 
claims during reexamination, DBC submitted three 
declarations pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.132 to 
provide objective evidence of nonobviousness. 
These declarations attempted to demonstrate the 
success of the commercial embodiment of the patented 
invention, known commercially as XanGo™ 
juice. The examiner was not persuaded by DBC's

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

evidence, however, and following a telephonic interview, 
made the rejection final. 

DBC appealed the examiner's final rejection to 
the Board. The Board agreed with the examiner that 
the seven prior art references in the record rendered 
obvious all pending claims. The Board also concluded 
that DBC's proffered evidence of commercial 
success was not sufficient to overcome the 
prima facie showing of obviousness. As a result, 
the Board affirmed the examiner's rejection of the 
pending claims as obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103. 

*1377 DBC timely appealed. We have jurisdiction 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(4)(A). 

II. DISCUSSION 
A. Standard of Review 
[1][2][3] A claimed invention is unpatentable if 
the differences between it and the prior art are such 
that the subject matter as a whole would have been 
obvious at the time the invention was made to a 
person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art. 35 

U.S.C. § 103(a); see also generally KSR Int'l Co. v. 
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 
L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). The ultimate determination of 
whether an invention would have been obvious is a 
legal conclusion based on underlying findings of 
fact. In re Dembiczak, 175 F.3d 994, 998 
(Fed.Cir.1999), abrogated on other grounds by In 
re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2000). 
We review the Board's ultimate determination of 
obviousness de novo. Id. We review the Board's underlying 
factual findings for substantial evidence. 
Gartside, 203 F.3d at 1316. 
B. Analysis 
DBC challenges the Board's decision on three 
FN1

primary grounds.First, DBC contends that the 
Board erred in finding a prima facie case of obviousness 
based on a substantial new question of patentability. 
Next, it contends that even if the Board 
properly found a prima facie case of obviousness, it 
erred by concluding that the submitted evidence of 
commercial success was insufficient to rebut the 
prima facie case. Finally, DBC argues that even if 

the Board correctly affirmed the examiner's rejection 
of the claims as obvious, its decision must nevertheless 
be vacated because two members of the 
panel that heard the appeal were unconstitutionally 
appointed. We address each contention in turn, beginning 
with DBC's challenge under the Appointments 
Clause. 

FN1. DBC also makes a number of arguments 
related to its contention that various 
aspects of the Board's decision qualify as 
new grounds of rejection. We have considered 
those arguments but find them unpersuasive. 
We also observe that DBC 
failed to request rehearing or reopening of 
prosecution pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 41.77, 
which it could have done had it believed 
that the Board made a new ground of rejection 
in affirming the examiner. 

1. Appointments Clause 
[4] DBC argues that regardless of the merits of 
the underlying rejection, the decision of the Board 
must be vacated because two of the administrative 
patent judges on the panel were appointed unconstiFN2


tutionally.The government counters that DBC 
waived this issue by failing to raise it either before 

FN3

the Board or in its opening brief in this appeal.
We agree with the government that DBC waived 
the issue by failing to raise it before the Board. 

FN2. DBC first raised this argument in a 
supplemental brief filed after briefing in 
this case was completed. 

FN3. The government contends, alternatively, 
that Congress has already remedied 
the problem by enacting legislation providing 
a defense to a challenge to the appointment 
of an administrative patent judge that 
the administrative patent judge was acting 
as a “de facto officer.” Because we conclude 
that DBC has waived the argument, 
we need not and do not address this contention.

545 F.3d 1373, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1123 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

In an article published in 2007, Professor John 

F. Duffy of the George Washington University Law 
School contended that legislation enacted in 2000 
and delegating the power to appoint administrative 
patent judges to the Director of the PTO (“the Director”) 
instead of the Secretary of Commerce 
(“Secretary”) was constitutionally infirm under the 
Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. 
See *1378 John F. Duffy, Are Administrative Patent 
Judges Constitutional?, 2007 Patently-O Patent 
L.J. 21, 21 (2007). Professor Duffy argued that the 
Director may not constitutionally be delegated the 
power to appoint administrative patent judges, who 
are “inferior Officers” in the words of the Appointments 
Clause, because the Appointments Clause 
vests that authority only to “the President alone, in 
the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” 
Id. at 21-25. DBC relies upon Professor 
Duffy's theory here in arguing that because the administrative 
patent judges were unconstitutionally 
appointed, the Board's decision must be vacated. As 
noted above, DBC did not raise its objection to the 
manner of appointment to the Board itself. The 
threshold question thus presented is whether its 
failure to do so resulted in a waiver of the challenge. 
[5] It is well-established that a party generally 
may not challenge an agency decision on a basis 
that was not presented to the agency. See Woodford 
v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 
L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) ( “As a general rule ... courts 
should not topple over administrative decisions unless 
the administrative body not only has erred, but 
has erred against objection made at the time appropriate 
under its practice.”) (quoting United States v. 
L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 
67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952) (emphasis omitted)). In L.A. 
Tucker, for example, the Interstate Commerce 
Commission approved an application to extend a 
motor carrier route. An examiner of the agency recommended 
that the application be granted, and a 
division of the Commission approved the recommendation. 
L.A. Tucker, which had opposed the application, 
requested, but was denied, reconsideration 
by the full Commission. L.A. Tucker then petitioned 
for further relief, which was also denied. It 
then filed suit in district court challenging the 
agency's grant of the application. Before the district 
court, L.A. Tucker raised for the first time the argument 
that the Commission's action was invalid because 
the examiner had not been properly appointed 
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. The 
district court permitted L.A. Tucker to make the argument, 
and invalidated the agency's action on that 
basis. 

The Supreme Court appeal raised the single 
question “whether such an objection, first made at 
that stage of the proceedings, was not erroneously 
entertained.” L.A. Tucker, 344 U.S. at 35, 73 S.Ct. 

67. Reversing the district court, the Supreme Court 
found L.A. Tucker's objection untimely, characterizing 
its challenge to the examiner's appointment as 
“clearly an afterthought, brought forward at the last 
possible moment to undo the administrative proceedings 
without consideration of the merits and 
[which] can prevail only from technical compulsion 
irrespective of considerations of practical justice.” 
Id. at 36, 73 S.Ct. 67. Finding the objection untimely, 
the Court reasoned that “orderly procedure 
and good administration require that objections to 
the proceedings of an administrative agency be 
made while it has opportunity for correction in order 
to raise issues reviewable by the courts.” Id. at 
37, 73 S.Ct. 67. 
As the Supreme Court later explained in Wood-
ford, the requirement that a party object to an 
agency prior to attacking that agency's action in 
court serves two primary purposes. See Woodford, 
548 U.S. at 89, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (discussing administrative 
exhaustion vis-àvis the Prison Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995). First, it “gives [the] agency an 
opportunity to correct its own mistakes ... before it 
is haled into federal court, and [thus] discourages 
disregard of [the agency's] procedures.” Id. at 89, 
126 S.Ct. 2378 (last modification in original, internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). If 
DBC had raised this *1379 issue in its appeal be

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

fore the Board, the Board would have had an opportunity 
to consider and cure the alleged constitutional 
infirmity. Under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b), the Director 
has authority to designate the members of Board 
panels. The Director has delegated that authority to 
the Chief Administrative Patent Judge. See Manual 
of Patent Examining Procedure § 1002.02(f) (8th 
ed., rev.6, Sept. 2007), available at http:// www. 
uspto. gov/ web/ offices/ pac/ mpep/ mpep_ e 8 r 5_ 
1000. pdf. According to the Board's standard operating 
procedures, the Chief Administrative Patent 
Judge “will approve a revised designation” of the 
judges on any particular panel “[w]hen satisfied 
that there is good reason to change the panel 
already designated.” Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences, Standard Operating Procedure 1 
(Revision 12): Assignment of Judges to Merits Panels, 
Motions Panels, and Expanded Panels at 6 
(Aug. 10, 2005), available at http:// www. uspto. 
gov/ go/ dcom/ bpai/ sop 1. pdf. As evidenced by 
DBC's supplemental brief and its attachments, DBC 
was able to determine, based on the appointment 
dates of the administrative patent judges in question, 
that they were appointed by the Director and 
thus subject to an Appointments Clause challenge. 
Thus, nothing prevented DBC from taking steps 
while this case was before the Board to ascertain 
the appointment status of the administrative patent 
judges assigned to its case. Even if DBC did not 
learn of the judges assigned to its panel until oral 
argument or until a decision was issued, it still had 
an opportunity to challenge the composition of the 
panel in a post-argument submission or in a motion 
for reconsideration. If DBC had timely raised this 
issue before the Board, the Board could have evaluated 
and corrected the alleged constitutional infirmity 
by providing DBC with a panel of administrative 
patent judges appointed by the Secretary. Of 
course, the Board may not have corrected the problem, 
or even acknowledged that the problem existed. 
But in that case, DBC would have preserved its 
right to appeal the issue. 

The second purpose for requiring that a party 
make an objection to the agency is that it promotes 

judicial efficiency, as “[c]laims generally can be resolved 
much more quickly and economically in 
proceedings before [the] agency than in litigation in 
federal court.” Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89, 126 S.Ct. 
2378. The relief DBC seeks with respect to this 
claim is for a properly appointed panel of administrative 
patent judges to review the examiner's rejection 
of its claims. If DBC had objected to the 
Board, instead of to this court in the first instance, 
it could have obtained relief immediately, and thus 
avoided the unnecessary expenditure of the administrative 
resources of the original Board panel, the 
judicial resources of this court, and the substantial 
delay and costs incurred in prosecuting this appeal. 

[6] While the foregoing supports the conclusion 
that DBC has waived challenging the appointments, 
there is one final inquiry that nonetheless remains. 
Because we retain discretion to reach issues 
raised for the first time on appeal, we must consider 
whether this is one of those exceptional cases that 
warrants consideration of the Appointments Clause 
issue despite its tardy presentation. See Golden 
Bridge Tech., Inc. v. Nokia, Inc., 527 F.3d 1318, 
1322-23 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“While appellate courts 
are given the discretion to decide when to deviate 
from th[e] general rule of waiver, we have explained 
that ‘prudential considerations' articulated 
by the Supreme Court counsel against hearing new 
arguments for the first time on appeal absent limited 
circumstances.”) (internal citations omitted); 
see also Golden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson 
Co., 365 F.3d 1054, 1062 (Fed.Cir.2004). 

*1380 The Supreme Court itself has, in “rare 
cases,” exercised its discretion to review a constitutional 
challenge not timely raised before the lower 
tribunal. See, e.g., Freytag v. Comm'r, 501 U.S. 
868, 879, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991); 
see also Nguyen v. United States, 539 U.S. 69, 78, 
123 S.Ct. 2130, 156 L.Ed.2d 64 (2003); Glidden 
Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 536, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 8 
L.Ed.2d 671 (1962). Like this case, Freytag, Nguyen, 
and Glidden involved constitutional challenges 
under the Appointments Clause. The Supreme

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

Court has never indicated that such challenges must 
be heard regardless of waiver. See Freytag, 501 

U.S. at 893, 111 S.Ct. 2631 (Scalia, J., concurring 
in part and concurring in the judgment) (observing 
that the court did not create a general rule excusing 
waiver). Rather, the Court has proceeded on a caseby-
case basis, determining whether the circumstances 
of the particular case warrant excusing the 
failure to timely object. See id., 501 U.S. at 879, 
111 S.Ct. 2631 (“We conclude that this is one of 
those rare cases in which we should exercise our 
discretion to hear petitioners' challenge to the constitutional 
authority of the Special Trial Judge.”). 
DBC has recognized that our excusal of its waiver 
is discretionary, see Oral Arg. at 2:20-2:22, available 
at http:// oralarguments. cafc. uscourts. gov/ 
mp 3/ 2008-1120. mp 3, but nevertheless urges us 
to consider the merits of its Appointments Clause 
challenge. 
We decline DBC's invitation to consider a challenge 
it failed to timely raise, as we do not view the 
circumstances of this case to warrant such an exceptional 
measure. Primarily, we reemphasize that 
while this issue could have been raised before the 
Board, it was not. Although DBC may not have appreciated 
the argument until discovering Professor 

FN4

Duffy's article,that article was not an intervening 
change in law or facts, nor was it based on any 
legal or factual propositions that were not knowable 
to DBC when it was proceeding before the Board. 
We are not persuaded to overlook DBC's lack of diligence 
to present an issue of which it was, or 
should have been, aware. To permit litigants like 
DBC to raise such issues for the first time on appeal 
would encourage what Justice Scalia has referred to 
as sandbagging, i.e., “suggesting or permitting, for 
strategic reasons, that the trial court pursue a certain 
course, and later-if the outcome is unfavorable-
claiming that the course followed was reversible error.” 
Freytag, 501 U.S. at 895, 111 S.Ct. 2631 
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the 
judgment). 

FN4. Professor Duffy's article was pub


lished on July 23, 2007, over one month 
before the Board issued the decision from 
which DBC appeals (and over six months 
prior to DBC filing its opening brief here). 
Although we do not consider the article to 
have any effect on DBC's obligation to 
raise the issue, we note that even if it 
somehow gave DBC a fresh opportunity to 
present the objection, DBC failed to diligently 
do so. 

We also consider the remedial action taken by 
Congress to weigh against considering the waived 
challenge. On August 12, 2008, the President 
signed into law legislation that redelegated the 
power of appointment to the Secretary, thereby 
eliminating the issue of unconstitutional appointments 
going forward. Pub.L. No. 110-313, § 
1(a)(1)(B), 122 Stat. 3014, 3014 (2008) (codified at 
35 U.S.C. § 6(a)). The legislation also includes a 
provision attempting retroactive correction of the 
Director's appointments by providing “a defense to 
a challenge to the appointment of an administrative 
patent judge on the basis of the judge's having been 
originally appointed by the Director that the administrative 
patent judge so appointed was acting as a 
de facto officer.” Pub.L. No. 110-313, § 1(a)(1)(C), 
122 Stat. 3014, 3014 (2008) (codified at 35 U.S.C. 
§ 6(d)). *1381 While we take no position on the 
constitutionality of that defense, Congress's action 
in fixing the problem prospectively means that our 
decision will not affect cases decided by future panels 
of the Board. This argues against our exercising 
discretion to address the issue. 

Finally, DBC has not made any allegation of 
incompetence or other impropriety regarding the 
administrative patent judges who heard its appeal, 
nor has it alleged that these judges are somehow 
unqualified to serve in the position. Indeed, the 
Secretary, acting under the new statute, has reappointed 
the administrative patent judges involved 
in DBC's appeal. Thus, even if we were to exercise 
our discretion to consider DBC's constitutional argument, 
conclude that the judges were improperly

appointed, and remand to the Board for reconsideration 
by a properly appointed panel, there is nothing 
to suggest that the Board would do anything 
other than simply (and legitimately) assign the case 
to the same panel. The fact that we have affirmed 
the merits of the Board's action in this case also 
speaks against our exercising discretion and needlessly 
protracting the reexamination of the present 
patent. 

We conclude that the circumstances presented 
here do not warrant the exercise of our discretion to 
hear DBC's Appointments Clause challenge. 

2. Prima Facie Case of Obviousness 
[7] A patent may not issue “if the differences 
between the subject matter sought to be patented 
and the prior art are such that the subject matter as 
a whole would have been obvious at the time the 
invention was made to a person having ordinary 
skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.” 
35 U.S.C. § 103(a); see also generally KSR, 
550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705. As 
noted above, obviousness is a question of law based 
on underlying facts. Dembiczak, 175 F.3d at 998. 
The Board concluded that the prior art relied upon 
by the examiner established a prima facie case of 
obviousness: 
Of record in the rejection is JP '442, which discusses 
the known medicinal qualities of pericarp. 
Of particular interest is Example 6, found on 
page 16 of the translation, which describes a 
drink which includes orange juice, water, and an 
extract of pericarp. 

JP '442 describes health benefits of its composition; 
consequently it is a nutraceutical according 
to the Appellant's definition in the Specification. 
Example 6 of JP '443 [sic] includes pericarp from 
fruit of a Garcinia mangostana L. tree in the 
form of a medicinal extract. Example 6 also includes 
orange juice, which is a juice selected 
from the group consisting of fruit juice and vegetable 
juice. 

Thus, the only difference between the single 
closest piece of prior art of record and instant 
claim 1 is the addition of juice from fruit of a 
Garcinia mangostana L. tree into the drink. 

*** 

Duke describes that Garcinia Mangostana L. is 
“cultivated for its fruit, which has a flavor suggestive 
of strawberry and grape; said to be the 
most delicious of all tropical fruits.” Yaacob describes 
mangosteen fruits as “one of the finest 
flavored fruits in the world, outranking all other 
tropical fruits; the mangosteen has therefore 
justly earned the popular title of ‘Queen of 
Fruits.’ ” 

We agree with the Examiner that these references 
provide ample motivation to combine mangosteen 
juice, another fruit or vegetable juice, 
and mangosteen pericarp in a beverage, to cover 
up the taste of the mangosteen rind.

omitted). 

On appeal, DBC primarily argues that the 
Board failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness 
based upon a substantial new question of 
patentability because the JP '442 reference is cumu

lative and non-analogous art.DBC argues that 
since JP '442 was the only new prior art reference 
cited during reexamination, it cannot raise a substantial 
new question of patentability. In In re 
Hiniker Co., we suggested that a reference that 
“was not material to the question of obviousness ... 
or ... was cumulative with any old art” was not sufficient 
to create a substantial new question of patentability. 
150 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1998). Relying 
on this passage, DBC contends that JP '442 is 
not material to obviousness and is cumulative over 
the prior art references that were before the examiner 
during the original prosecution. We disagree 
with DBC on both points. 

FN5. DBC also argues that the Board's de

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

cision constitutes a new ground of rejection 
because the Board cited the English 
translation of JP ' 442, while only the English 
translation of the abstract of that document 
was before the examiner. We discern 
no merit in this argument. As we discuss 
infra, the Board's use of the example in the 
translation goes no farther than, and 
merely elaborates upon, what is taught by 
the abstract. 

The abstract of JP '442 describes a composition 
designed to be resistant to legionella bacteria and 
which includes one or more extracts from a number 
of fruits and other biological products, one of 
which is mangosteen rind. The examiner observed, 
in his answer before the Board, that “[i]f you want 
to consume the rind, it was known in the prior art to 
mix it with a fruit such as strawberry as taught by 
JP '442 (abstract).” J.A. at 3735; see also id. at 
3735-36 (“The key piece of art is JP '442 which 
clearly teaches mangosteen rind and raspberry, 
strawberry and/or blackberry in the same composition.”). 
The Board similarly concluded that the reference 
teaches “a legionella bacteria disinfection 
agent and ingestible compositions, e.g., drinks, that 
contain the disinfection agent.” Decision at 5. Thus, 
as both the examiner and the Board recognized, the 
abstract teaches mixing the mangosteen rind in a 
composition with fruits and fruit juices to obtain a 
legionella resistant composition (a nutraceutical under 
the '333 patent's definition of the word). Because 
it teaches a nutraceutical beverage combining 
fruits and fruit juices and mangosteen rind in the 
same composition, JP '442 is plainly material to 
patentability. 

[8] DBC also contends that JP '442 is cumulative 
over JP '501, which “describes the reconstitution 
of the [mangosteen] extract into a drug and 
states that the drug can take any suitable form for 
administration including as a syrup, solution, or 
suspension with a carrier.” Decision at 6. But, as is 
plain from JP '501, that reference does not teach 
that mangosteen rind (or extract) can be made into a 
composition with fruits or fruit juices, only that it 
can be made into a “syrup, solution, or suspension 
with a carrier.” Because JP '442 is the only reference 
that teaches that the mangosteen rind can be 
combined with fruits and fruit juices to make a nutraceutical 
composition, it is not cumulative with respect 
to any of the prior art references that were before 
the original examiner. We thus reject DBC's 
argument that JP '442 does not raise a substantial 
new question of patentability. 

DBC does not appear to challenge the Board's 
prima facie case of obviousness per se, only that it 
was not based upon a substantial new question of 
patentability. Because we have rejected that argument, 
and because JP '442, together with the other 
references cited, is substantial evidence*1383 fully 
supporting the Board's finding of a prima facie case 
of obviousness, we affirm that portion of the 
Board's decision. 

3. Secondary Considerations 
[9] During reexamination, and in response to 
the examiner's rejection of the pending claims, 
DBC submitted three declarations pursuant to 37 
C.F.R. § 1.132 in an effort to demonstrate the commercial 
success of XanGo™ juice. These declarations, 
made by Kent Wood, Craig Johanson, and 
Stephen Bean-officers and employees of XanGo, 
LLC (“XanGo”), the exclusive licensee of DBC and 
marketer of XanGo™ juice-described, among other 
things, the ingredients in XanGo™ juice and the 
process for making it. Those statements were 
offered in an attempt to show that the juice is made 
according to the claims of the ' 333 patent. The submitted 
declarations also demonstrated that 
XanGo™ juice enjoyed $130 million in gross sales 
during the first two years it was on the market, and 
that XanGo's advertising budget represented only a 
small fraction of sales. 
The Board was unpersuaded by DBC's evidence, 
finding that it was insufficient to overcome 
the strong prima facie case of obviousness. Decision 
at 30. In particular, the Board found that:

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 11 

545 F.3d 1373, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1123 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

The Appellants have not established with credible 
and persuasive evidence what product was 
marketed and when. The Appellants have not established 
that the product which was sold is commensurate 
in scope with the scope of the claims 
for which protection is sought. Finally, the Appellants 
have not persuaded us that the sales are a 
result of anything other than network marketing, 
the increasing popularity of mangosteen, and improved 
availability of the mangosteen fruit in 
general. 

Accordingly, we find that the evidence of commercial 
success is insufficient to persuade us of 
the unobviousness of the claimed subject matter, 
which differs from the prior art only in the addition 
of a known, tasty, mangosteen juice. 

Id. DBC makes several arguments to support 
its contention that the Board erred in finding that its 
evidence of commercial success did not overcome 
the prima facie case of obviousness. 

[10] First, DBC argues that the Board erred by 
concluding that the evidence failed to show that 
XanGo™ juice was commensurate with the claims. 
On this point, we agree with DBC. The Board concluded 
that the Bean declaration, which proffered 
that XanGo™ juice was commensurate in scope 
with the claims of the ' 333 patent, was not worthy 
of credibility: 
Mr. Bean's Declaration provides no persuasive 
evidence of any real personal knowledge of the 
contents of XanGo™ for the relevant time frame 
for claimed commercial success. For example, no 
chemical analyses, product batch sheets, manufacturing 
records, sales records, or the like are 
provided in support of any specific testimony that 
the commercially sold XanGo™ product contains 
the listed ingredients.... In sum, we do not find 
paragraph 5 [listing the ingredients] to be persuasive 
or credible. 

Decision at 27. In his declaration, Bean avers 
personal knowledge of the contents of XanGo™ 

juice, based on discussions with employees, contractors, 
and officers of DBC. J.A. at 343. Under 
the circumstances of this case, no more is required 
to demonstrate that the XanGo™ juice falls within 
the scope of the claims, particularly when the 
product label itself demonstrates as much. 

[11] The Board also called Bean's credibility 
into question because, when stating that XanGo™ 
juice was commensurate with the claims, he did not 
state that it also included a vegetable juice. Apparently,*
1384 the Board thought that the commercial 
embodiment of the claim must contain both a fruit 
juice and a vegetable juice since the claim recites 
“at least one second juice selected from the group 
consisting of fruit juice and vegetable juice.” On 
this point, the Board also erred. DBC need not sell 
every conceivable embodiment of the claims in order 
to rely upon evidence of commercial success, so 
long as what was sold was within the scope of the 
claims. See Applied Materials, Inc. v. Adv. Semiconductor 
Materials Am., Inc., 98 F.3d 1563, 1570 
(Fed.Cir.1996) (“[A] patentee need not show that 
all possible embodiments within the claims were 
successfully commercialized in order to rely on the 
success in the marketplace of the embodiment that 
was commercialized.”). 
Next, DBC argues that the Board erred when it 
found no nexus between the claimed invention and 
the submitted evidence of commercial success. Related 
to this argument, DBC also claims the Board 
erred when it suggested that the commercial success 
of XanGo™ juice may be attributable to other 
factors, such as aggressive network marketing. The 
Board concluded that although $130 million in 
sales in two years was a substantial figure, there 
was “no persuasive evidence tying those sales to 
the claimed subject matter.” Decision at 29. Elaborating 
on this point, the Board observed that the 
evidence in the record suggested that the success of 
XanGo™ juice may be due to other factors-for example, 
the increasing popularity of the mangosteen 
fruit in general. Id. Based on this increasing popularity, 
it observed that there was “no evidence

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 12 

545 F.3d 1373, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1123 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373) 

comparing the growth in sales of XanGo™ to the 
growth in sales of mangosteen juice in general.” Id. 
The Board also highlighted the marketing structure 
of XanGo, which is a “network marketing company” 
that pays substantial commissions for sales, 
and noted that “[h]ow much of the commercial success 
is due to aggressive network marketing in the 
form of sales commissions and bonuses is unexplained 
by the Appellants.” Id. at 30. In light of 
these infirmities in DBC's submitted evidence, the 
Board found it insufficient to upset the prima facie 
case of obviousness. 

The Board's conclusion is supported by substantial 
evidence. We have held on a number of occasions 
that evidence of commercial success alone 
is not sufficient to demonstrate nonobviousness of a 
claimed invention. Rather, the proponent must offer 
proof “that the sales were a direct result of the 
unique characteristics of the claimed invention-as 
opposed to other economic and commercial factors 
unrelated to the quality of the patented subject matter.” 
In re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 140 
(Fed.Cir.1996); see also In re GPAC Inc., 57 F.3d 
1573, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1995) (“For objective evidence 
to be accorded substantial weight, its proponent 
must establish a nexus between the evidence and 
the merits of the claimed invention.”). Here, DBC 
has done little more than submit evidence of sales. 
However substantial those sales, that evidence does 
not reveal in any way that the driving force behind 
those sales was the claimed combination of mangosteen 
fruit, mangosteen rind extract, and fruit or 
vegetable juice. Nor is there any evidence that sales 
of XanGo™ juice were not merely attributable to 
the increasing popularity of mangosteen fruit or the 
effectiveness of the marketing efforts employed. 
For the foregoing reasons, we cannot conclude that 
the Board's decision is unsupported by substantial 
evidence. We thus affirm that portion of the Board's 
decision. 

III. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the 
Board is 

AFFIRMED.

Dr. Kenneth Alonso appeals a decision of the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office Board 
of Patent Appeals and Interferences (“Board”) sustaining 
in part the examiner's final rejection of 
claim 92 of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/469,749 
(“'749 Application”). In its decision, the Board reversed 
the examiner's rejection of claim 92 for lack 
of enablement and sustained the rejection as invalid 
for lack of adequate written description. Ex parte 
Alonso, No.2006-2148 (B.P.A.I. July 25, 2007) (“ 
Decision ”). We affirm. 

I. BACKGROUND 
An arsenal of antibodies generated by the immune 
system defends the human body against illnesses 
caused by bacteria and cancerous cells and 
other invasive agents. Antibodies are large, Y-

shaped molecules secreted by white blood cells 
known as “B lymphocytes,” or “B-cells.” Antibodies 
are capable of binding to the surfaces of foreign 
cells or other substances known as “antigens.” The 
specific location on the surface of the antigen 
where the antibody attaches is termed the 
“epitope.” The arms of the Y-shaped molecule bind 
to the epitope with specificity. Antibodies that bind 
to the same epitope are said to have the same 
“idiotype.” Monoclonal antibodies (“MAbs”) are 
derived from a single precursor and have a single 
idiotype. They are produced using “hybridoma” 
(fusion) technology. A human-to-human hybridoma 
is created by fusing a human tumor cell to an antibody-
producing human B-cell, resulting in secretion 
by the B-cell of monoclonal antibodies with 
identical affinity and specificity to a given epitope 
on the surface of the tumor cell. 

On June 6, 1995, Dr. Alonso filed the '749 Application 
entitled, “Method of Producing Human-
Human Hybridomas, The Production of Monoclonal 
and Polyclonal Antibodies Therefrom, and 

FN1

Therapeutic Use Thereof.” The claimed invention 
recites*1018 a method for treating neurofibrosarcoma, 
a rare cancer of the sheath of a peripheral 
nerve, that uses human monoclonal antibodies 
targeted at a patient's tumor. Claim 92 of the 
'749 Application discloses 

FN1. Alonso claimed priority to an application 
he filed seven years earlier involving 
similar subject matter. 

[a] method of treating neurofibrosarcoma in a human 
by administering an effective amount of a 
monoclonal antibody idiotypic to the neurofibrosarcoma 
of said human, wherein said 
monoclonal antibody is secreted from a human-
human hybridoma derived from the neurofibrosarcoma 
cells. 
In Example 1 of the '749 Specification, Alonso 
described the preparation of a tumor cell suspension 
from the sample of a tumor and the subsequent 
sensitization of human spleen cells. The sensitized

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1015) 

spleen cells are fused with an immortalized cell line 
(e.g., a fetal marrow line, a lymphoblastoid line, or 
a plasma cell line from myeloma). The resulting 
cells are screened for hybridomas that secrete antibodies 
specifically reactive with the sensitizing tumor 
cells (and non-reactive with a range of other 
tissues and cell types). Example 2 disclosed the results 
of an experiment conducted by Alonso in treating 
Melanie Brown, a patient with neurofibrosarcoma. 
Adult spleen cells were sensitized with cells 
from Brown's tumor. The resulting hybridoma 
secreted monoclonal antibodies, which reacted with 
a 221 KiloDalton tumor surface antigen. The spleen 
line (AS-151), the lymphoblast fusion line 
(BM-95), and the hybridoma (HB983) were deposited 
with the American Type Culture Collection in 
September of 1998. The antibody from the hybridoma 
line was deposited with the Food and Drug 

FN2

Administration.

FN2. Alonso infused Brown with 100 mg 
of the antibody, and cancerous lesions in 
her lungs were cleared within twenty-four 
hours. In addition, Brown's brain tumor became 
necrotic within seven days, and she 
experienced a one-month regression of her 
cancer. 

The examiner rejected claim 92 as lacking adequate 
written descriptive support for the broad 
genus of antibodies encompassed by the claim language. 


Applicant is reminded that the disclosure only describes 
the preparation of a single Mab produced 
by the hybridoma cell line HB983. However, the 
claims are directed toward a much larger genus of 
molecules (i.e., Mabs that bind to a neurofibrosarcoma), 
not a specific Mab identified by 
the deposited hybridoma.... The crux of the rejection 
is whether or not applicant has provided sufficient 
support for the broadly claimed genus of 
therapeutic antibodies. As set forth in the rejection, 
the skilled artisan would reasonably conclude 
that applicant was clearly not in possession 
of the claimed genus of compounds. Applicant 

should direct the claim language toward the only 
described embodiment (e.g., a Mab produced by 
hybridoma HB983). 

The Board affirmed the rejection, agreeing that 
Alonso had not adequately described the claimed 
invention because the “single antibody described in 
the Specification is insufficiently representative to 
provide adequate written descriptive support for the 
genus of antibodies required to practice the claimed 
invention.” Decision, slip op. at 7. 

II. DISCUSSION 
[1][2][3][4] Whether an applicant has complied 
with the written description requirement is a finding 
of fact, to be analyzed from the perspective of 
one of ordinary skill in the art as of the date of the 
filing of the application. Regents of the Univ. of 
Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559, 1566 
(Fed.Cir.1997); *1019Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 
935 F.2d 1555, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1991). This Court reviews 
the Board's factual determinations under a 
substantial evidence standard. In re Gartside, 203 
F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2000). “Substantial evidence” 
is relevant evidence that “a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” 
Id. at 1312 (citation omitted). In making the assessment, 
we examine “the record as a whole, taking into 
account evidence that both justifies and detracts 
from an agency's decision.” Id. That a fact finder 
could draw “two inconsistent conclusions from the 
evidence does not prevent an administrative 
agency's finding from being supported by substantial 
evidence.” Id. (citation omitted). Rather, the 
Board's decision must be affirmed if any 
“reasonable fact finder could have arrived at the 
[same] decision.” Id. 

[5] The written description requirement of 35 
U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1, is straightforward: “The specification 
shall contain a written description of the invention....” 
To satisfy this requirement, the specification 
must describe the invention in sufficient 
detail so “that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude 
that the inventor invented the claimed invention 
as of the filing date sought.” Lockwood v. Am.

v. Frank, 52 F.3d 1035, 1039 (Fed.Cir.1995). 

[6][7] The requirement “serves a teaching function, 
as a ‘quid pro quo ’ in which the public is given 
‘meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded 
from practicing the invention for a limited 
period of time.’ ” Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. 
Searle & Co., Inc., 358 F.3d 916, 922 
(Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen


FN3

Probe Inc., 323 F.3d 956, 970 (Fed.Cir.2002)).
The Board framed the issue raised by the '749 Application 
as follows. 


FN3. The requirement is rigorous, but not 
exhaustive: “[I]t is unnecessary to spell out 
every detail of the invention in the specification; 
only enough must be included to 
convince a person of skill in the art that the 
inventor possessed the invention.” LizardTech, 
424 F.3d at 1345. 

[W]hether the single monoclonal antibody described 
in the Specification is representative of 
the genus of monoclonal antibodies required to 
practice the claimed treatment method. That, in 
turn, depends on whether or not the antibodies 
(and the antigens they bind) would have been expected 
to vary substantially within the genus. The 
greater the variation in the genus, the less representative 
any particular antibody would be. 
Decision, slip op. at 6. 

The Board properly characterized the relevant 
genus as the “genus of antibodies specific to neurofibrosarcoma 
cells.” Id. A genus can be described 
by disclosing: (1) a representative number of species 
in that genus; or (2) its “relevant identifying 
characteristics,” such as “complete or partial structure, 
other physical and/or chemical properties, 
functional characteristics when coupled with a 
known or disclosed correlation between function 
and structure, or some combination of such characteristics.” 
Enzo, 323 F.3d at 964. 

Relying principally on two scientific articles, 

including one authored by Alonso himself, the 

Board determined that 

[t]here is ample evidence of record that the specificities 
of antibodies falling within the scope of 
the genus (and the structures of the antigens they 
bind) would be expected to vary substantially. 

FN4

For example, Osband provides evidence 
*1020 of a recognition in the art that considerable 
antigenic “heterogeneity of tumors both between 
patients and metastatic sites within a single patient” 
is to be expected. In addition, an article au


FN5

thored by [Alonso] acknowledges that “[t]he 
efficacy of antibody therapy is thought to be related 
to tumor burden as well as to idiotypic 
change in the original tumor. ” This acknowledged 
heterogeneity is reflected in the goal of 
the claimed method-to raise customized antibodies 
to possibly unique antigens on a particular patient's 
tumor.

Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against Tumor 
Surface Antigen in the Treatment of

Finally, as discussed above, for purposes of satisfying 
the written description requirement, it is not 
enough merely to disclose a method of making 
and identifying compounds capable of being used 
to practice the claimed invention. That is, it is not 
enough to describe[ ] the procedure for making a 
human-human hybridoma from neurofibrosarcoma, 
and teach how to determine whether a given 
antibody, specific to a patient's neurofibrosarcoma, 
will function in the claimed method. We 
find that the single antibody described in the Specification 
is insufficiently representative to

provide adequate written descriptive support for 
the genus of antibodies required to practice the 
claimed invention. 
Decision, slip op. at 6-7 (internal quotation marks 
and citations omitted, footnotes supplemented). 

[8] The Board's conclusion is supported by 
substantial evidence. The articles relied upon by the 
Board confirm the hypothesis that the antibodies required 
to perform Alonso's claimed method vary 
substantially in their composition. We have previously 
held in a similar context that “a patentee of a 
biotechnological invention cannot necessarily claim 
a genus after only describing a limited number of 
species because there may be unpredictability in the 
results obtained from species other than those specifically 
enumerated.” Noelle v. Lederman, 355 
F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2004). 
In another similar case, we evaluated claims 
directed to a method of determining whether a drug 
could selectively inhibit the activity of COX-2, a 
cyclooxygenase thought to be responsible for inflammation 
associated with arthritis. See Rochester, 
358 F.3d at 917-18. One of the claims at issue was 
directed to “a method for selectively inhibiting 
[COX-2] activity in a human host, comprising administering 
a non-steroidal compound that selectively 
inhibits activity of the [COX-2] gene product 
to a human host in need of such treatment.” Id. at 

918. We found that the specification lacked written 
descriptive support, agreeing with the district court 
that 
it is clear from reading the patent that one critical 
aspect of the method-a compound that selectively 
inhibits [COX-2] activity-was hypothetical, for it 
is clear that the inventors had neither possession 
nor knowledge of such a compound.... [T]he 
claimed method depends upon finding a compound 
that selectively inhibits [COX-2] activity. 
Without such a compound, it is impossible to 
practice the claimed method of treatment. 

Id. at 926. We further noted that the specification 
contained “no disclosure of any method for 

making even a single ‘non-steroidal compound that 
selectively inhibits *1021 activity of the [COX-2] 
gene product,’ ” and failed to “steer the skilled 
practitioner toward compounds that can be used to 
carry out the claimed methods.” Id. at 928, 929. 

[9][10] Alonso attempts to distinguish his 
claimed invention from Rochester by emphasizing 
that he reduced his method to practice and identified 
the resulting compound. We are not persuaded 
by the distinction. “[P]roof of a reduction to practice, 
absent an adequate description in the specification 
of what is reduced to practice, does not serve 
to describe or identify the invention for purposes of 
[the written description requirement].” Enzo, 323 

FN6

F.3d at 969.Moreover, while it is true that 
Rochester disclosed no compounds that worked 
with the claimed method, the one compound disclosed 
by Alonso cannot be said to be representative 
of a densely populated genus. 

FN6. The reduction-to-practice argument 
also implicates § 112's enablement requirement. 
The Board reversed the examiner's 
rejection of claim 92 for lack of enablement. 
See Decision, slip op. at 12. Alonso 
argues that the Board's findings as to sufficiency 
of description and enablement are at 
odds with one another. It is true that the 
written description and enablement requirements 
“usually rise and fall together. 
That is, a recitation of how to make and 
use the invention across the full breadth of 
the claim is ordinarily sufficient to demonstrate 
that the inventor possesses the full 
scope of the invention, and vice versa.” 
LizardTech, 424 F.3d at 1345. However, 
we have been clear that “[a]lthough the 
legal criteria of enablement and written description 
are related and are often met by 
the same disclosure, they serve discrete 
legal requirements.” Capon v. Eshhar, 418 
F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2005). “[A]n invention 
may be enabled even though it has 
not been described.” Rochester, 358 F.3d

545 F.3d 1015, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1849 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1015) 

at 921. 

In Rochester, we reasoned that while the specification 


describes what can be done with any compounds 
that may potentially be identified through those 
assays, including formulation into pharmaceuticals, 
routes of administration, estimation of effective 
dosage, and suitable dosage forms ... the 
'850 patent does not disclose just which peptides, 
polynucleotides, and small organic molecules 
have the desired characteristics of selectively inhibiting 
[COX-2]. Without such disclosure the 
claimed methods cannot be said to have been described. 


Rochester, 358 F.3d at 927 (internal citation 
and quotation marks omitted). We additionally 
found that Rochester had failed to present any evidence 
that one skilled in the art would have been 
able to isolate and identify any given compound 
based on Rochester's “vague functional description....” 
Id. at 928. Even more recently, we held that 
the written disclosure requirement was not met 
where the claims at issue covered a broad “genus of 
recombinant plasmids that contain coding sequences 
for DNA polymerase ... from any bacterial 
source, [but] the narrow specifications of the 
[relevant patents] only disclose[d] the ... gene coding 
sequence from one bacterial source....” Carnegie 
Mellon Univ. v. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 541 
F.3d 1115, 1125 (Fed.Cir.2008) (emphasis added). 

The same is true here. The specification of the 
'749 Application does not characterize the antigens 
to which the monoclonal antibodies must bind; it 
discloses only the molecular weight of the one antigen 
identified in Example 2. This is clearly insuffi


FN7

cient.The specification teaches nothing about 
the structure, epitope characterization, binding affinity, 
specificity, or pharmacological properties 
common to the *1022 large family of antibodies 
implicated by the method. While Alonso's claim is 
written as a method, the antibodies themselves are 
described in purely structural language-“a mono


clonal antibody idiotypic to the neurofibrosarcoma 
of said human.” This sparse description of antibody 
structure in the claim stands in stark contrast to the 
detailed method of making the antibodies found in 
the specification. 

FN7. It bears mentioning that the examiner 
encouraged Alonso to amend his claims to 
cover only the MAb produced by the identified 
hybridoma. 

The Eli Lilly decision is also instructive. In Eli 
Lilly, the University of California laid claim to all 
vertebrate insulin cDNAs, including the human insulin 
cDNA, although it had identified only the 
cDNA for rat insulin. See Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at 

FN8

1567.We ruled that the written description requirement 
was not met because “a description of rat 
insulin cDNA is not a description of the broad 
classes of vertebrate or mammalian insulin cDNA.” 
Id. at 1568. As in Eli Lilly, the specification of the 
'749 Application contains information about only 

FN9

one compound.

FN8. The claims at issue in Eli Lilly were 
directed to “a recombinant plasmid replicable 
in [a] procaryotic host containing 
within its nucleotide sequence a subsequence 
having the structure of the reverse 
transcript of an mRNA of a vertebrate, 
which mRNA encodes insulin.” Eli 
Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1563 (emphasis in original). 


FN9. Alonso cites In re Herschler, 591 
F.2d 693 (CCPA 1979), where our predecessor 
court held that the disclosure of a 
single corticosteroid was sufficient to describe 
the genus of physiologically active 
steroids that could be used in practicing the 
claimed invention. The court based its decision 
on the fact that the class of implicated 
compounds was “chemically quite 
similar.” Id. at 701. Alonso argues that the 
same is true with respect to the antibodies 
generated by a patient's specific neur

ofibrosarcoma. However, he points to no 
evidence in the record corroborating his 
“similarity” thesis. 

Apart from the representative number of species 
test applied by the Board, we have found adequate 
written descriptive support for a claimed invention 
where the disclosure specifies “relevant 
identifying characteristics,” such as “complete or 
partial structure, other physical and/or chemical 
properties, functional characteristics when coupled 
with a known or disclosed correlation between 
function and structure, or some combination of 
such characteristics. ” Enzo, 323 F.3d at 964 
(emphasis in original). Alonso argues that there is a 
well-known correlation between the structure and 
function of the neurofibrosarcoma-specific antibodies 
generated by his disclosed treatment method. He 
maintains that the members of the genus of antibodies 
directed to a particular patient's tumor share the 
same function-they each bind to a patient's neurofibrosarcoma, 
thereby bolstering the patient's immune 
mechanism and stimulating an attack on the 
tumor cells. As for structure, Alonso argues that because 
monoclonal antibodies are secreted from a 
hybridoma made from a particular neurofibrosarcoma, 
the antibodies are necessarily specific. He 
further argues that there is a “well-known correlation 
between human antibody structure and antibody 
function.” 

Alonso did not raise this structure-function correlation 
argument in the proceedings before the 
Board. “Failure to advance legal theories before the 
[B]oard constitutes a failure to ‘make a complete 
presentation of the issues,’ and permitting a party to 
raise those theories for the first time [after the 
agency has rendered its final decision] would be 
both inefficient and ‘wasteful of administrative and 
judicial resources.’ ” Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc. 

v. Medtronic Vascular, Inc., 497 F.3d 1293, 1298 
(Fed.Cir.2007). Accordingly, we will not consider 
FN10

this newly minted argument on appeal.

FN10. Even were we tempted to consider 
the argument, Alonso would not be entitled 

to relief. In Noelle, the applicant claimed a 
human monoclonal antibody (or fragment 
thereof) secreted from a particular hybridoma 
that binds to an antigen expressed 
on activated T-cells. The application did 
not, however, disclose any structural information 
about the human antigen. 
Noelle, 355 F.3d at 1345-46. It described 
only the mouse antigen. We concluded that 
the function-structure correlation test was 
not met. 

If [the applicant] had sufficiently described 
the human form of CD40CR antigen, 
he could have claimed its antibody 
by simply stating its binding affinity for 
the “fully characterized” antigen. [The 
applicant] did not describe human 
CD40CR antigen. Therefore, [the applicant] 
attempted to define an unknown by 
its binding affinity to another unknown. 

Noelle, 355 F.3d at 1349. As Alonso has 
not pointed to any structure for his 
claimed antibodies, there is no structure 
to which he may correlate the function 
of his claimed antibodies. 

*1023 III. CONCLUSION 
For the aforementioned reasons, the decision of 
the Board is affirmed. 

AFFIRMED.

Federal Circuit. 
In re Bernard L. BILSKI and Rand A. Warsaw. 


No. 2007-1130. 
Oct. 30, 2008. 


Background: Patent applicants challenged denial 
of patent application for method of hedging risk in 
field of commodities trading based on lack of patent-
eligible subject matter. The Patent and Trademark 
Office, Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, 
2006 WL 5738364, sustained rejection of all 
claims in application. Applicants appealed. 

Holdings: Following sua sponte order of review en 
banc, the Court of Appeals, Michel, Chief Judge, 
held that: 

(1) machine-or-transformation test, rather than test 
determining whether claim recited algorithm applied 
in any manner to physical elements or process 
steps, was applicable test for determining patent-
eligibility of process claims, abrogating, In re Freeman, 
573 F.2d 1237, In re Walter, 618 F.2d 758, 
and In re Abele, 684 F.2d 902; 
(2) machine-or-transformation test, rather than 
“useful, concrete and tangible result” inquiry, was 
proper test to apply to determine patent-eligibility 
of process claims, abrogating In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 
1526, State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature 
Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368, and AT&T 
Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d 
1352; and 
(3) claim was not drawn to patent-eligible subject 
matter under transformation branch of machine-
or-transformation test. 
Affirmed. 

Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring, in 
which Linn, Circuit Judge, joined. 

Newman, Circuit Judge, filed opinion dissenting.

The proper inquiry to determine patent-eligibility 
of process claims is not whether the process 
claim recites sufficient physical steps, but rather 
whether the claim meets the machine-

to the analysis whether process steps performed by 
software on a computer are sufficiently physical. 35

Bilski, No.2002-2257, 2006 WL 5738364 (B.P.A.I. 
Sept. 26, 2006) (“ Board Decision ”). Specifically, 
Applicants argue that the examiner erroneously rejected 
the claims as not directed to patent-eligible 
subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101, and that the 
Board erred in upholding that rejection. The appeal 
was originally argued before a panel of the court on 
October 1, 2007. Prior to disposition by the panel, 
however, we sua sponte ordered en banc review. 
Oral argument before the en banc court was held on 
May 8, 2008. We affirm the decision of the Board 
because we conclude that Applicants' claims are not 
directed to patent-eligible subject matter, and in doing 
so, we clarify the standards applicable in determining 
whether a claimed method constitutes a 
statutory “process” under § 101. 

I. 
Applicants filed their patent application on 
April 10, 1997. The application contains eleven 
claims, which Applicants argue together here. 
Claim 1 reads: 

A method for managing the consumption risk 
costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider 
at a fixed price comprising the steps of: 

(a) initiating a series of transactions between 
said commodity provider and consumers of 
said commodity wherein said consumers purchase 
said commodity at a fixed rate based 
upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding 
to a risk position of said consumer; 
(b) identifying market participants for said 
commodity having a counter-risk position to 
said consumers; and 
(c) initiating a series of transactions between 
said commodity provider and said market participants 
at a second fixed rate such that said 
series of market participant transactions balances 
the risk position of said series of consumer 
transactions 
'892 application cl.1. In essence, the claim is 

for a method of hedging risk in the field of commodities 
trading. For example, coal power plants 
(i.e., the “consumers”) purchase coal to produce 
electricity and are averse to the risk of a spike in 
demand for coal since such a spike would increase 
the price and their costs. Conversely, coal mining 
companies (i.e., the “market participants”) are 
averse to the risk of a sudden drop in demand for 
coal since such a drop would reduce their sales and 
depress prices. The claimed method envisions an 
*950 intermediary, the “commodity provider,” that 
sells coal to the power plants at a fixed price, thus 
isolating the power plants from the possibility of a 
spike in demand increasing the price of coal above 
the fixed price. The same provider buys coal from 
mining companies at a second fixed price, thereby 
isolating the mining companies from the possibility 
that a drop in demand would lower prices below 
that fixed price. And the provider has thus hedged 
its risk; if demand and prices skyrocket, it has sold 
coal at a disadvantageous price but has bought coal 
at an advantageous price, and vice versa if demand 
and prices fall. Importantly, however, the claim is 
not limited to transactions involving actual commodities, 
and the application discloses that the recited 
transactions may simply involve options, i.e., 
rights to purchase or sell the commodity at a particular 
price within a particular timeframe. See J.A. at 
86-87. 

The examiner ultimately rejected claims 1-11 
under 35 U.S.C. § 101, stating: “[r]egarding ... 
claims 1-11, the invention is not implemented on a 
specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract 
idea and solves a purely mathematical problem 
without any limitation to a practical application, 
therefore, the invention is not directed to the 
technological arts.” See Board Decision, slip op. at 

3. The examiner noted that Applicants had admitted 
their claims are not limited to operation on a computer, 
and he concluded that they were not limited 
by any specific apparatus. See id. at 4. 
On appeal, the Board held that the examiner 
erred to the extent he relied on a “technological

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

arts” test because the case law does not support 
such a test. Id. at 41-42. Further, the Board held 
that the requirement of a specific apparatus was 
also erroneous because a claim that does not recite 
a specific apparatus may still be directed to patent-
eligible subject matter “if there is a transformation 
of physical subject matter from one state to another.” 
Id. at 42. Elaborating further, the Board stated: 
“ ‘mixing’ two elements or compounds to produce a 
chemical substance or mixture is clearly a statutory 
transformation although no apparatus is claimed to 
perform the step and although the step could be performed 
manually.” Id. But the Board concluded that 
Applicants' claims do not involve any patent-eligible 
transformation, holding that transformation of 
“non-physical financial risks and legal liabilities of 
the commodity provider, the consumer, and the 
market participants” is not patent-eligible subject 
matter. Id. at 43. The Board also held that Applicants' 
claims “preempt[ ] any and every possible way 
of performing the steps of the [claimed process], by 
human or by any kind of machine or by any combination 
thereof,” and thus concluded that they only 
claim an abstract idea ineligible for patent protection. 
Id. at 46-47. Finally, the Board held that Applicants' 
process as claimed did not produce a 
“useful, concrete and tangible result,” and for this 
reason as well was not drawn to patent-eligible subject 
matter. Id. at 49-50. 

Applicants timely appealed to this court under 
35 U.S.C. § 141. We have jurisdiction under 28 

U.S.C. § 1295(a)(4)(A). 
II. 
[1][2][3][4] Whether a claim is drawn to patent-
eligible subject matter under § 101 is a 
threshold inquiry, and any claim of an application 
failing the requirements of § 101 must be rejected 
even if it meets all of the other legal requirements 
of patentability. In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 1365, 

FN1 

1371 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting *951Parker v. 
Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 593, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 
L.Ed.2d 451 (1978)); In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952, 
960 (CCPA 1979), vacated as moot sub nom. Dia


mond v. Chakrabarty, 444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct. 
696, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980). Whether a claim is 
drawn to patent-eligible subject matter under § 101 
is an issue of law that we review de novo. Comiskey, 
499 F.3d at 1373; AT & T Corp. v. Excel Commc'ns, 
Inc., 172 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed.Cir.1999). 
Although claim construction, which we also review 
de novo, is an important first step in a § 101 analysis, 
see State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin. 
Group, 149 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed.Cir.1998) (noting 
that whether a claim is invalid under § 101 “is a 
matter of both claim construction and statutory construction”), 
there is no claim construction dispute in 
this appeal. We review issues of statutory interpretation 
such as this one de novo as well. Id. 

FN1. Although our decision in Comiskey 
may be misread by some as requiring in 
every case that the examiner conduct a § 
101 analysis before assessing any other issue 
of patentability, we did not so hold. As 
with any other patentability requirement, 
an examiner may reject a claim solely on 
the basis of § 101. Or, if the examiner 
deems it appropriate, she may reject the 
claim on any other ground(s) without addressing 
§ 101. But given that § 101 is a 
threshold requirement, claims that are 
clearly drawn to unpatentable subject matter 
should be identified and rejected on that 
basis. Thus, an examiner should generally 
first satisfy herself that the application's 
claims are drawn to patent-eligible subject 
matter. 

A. 
As this appeal turns on whether Applicants' invention 
as claimed meets the requirements set forth 
in § 101, we begin with the words of the statute: 

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful 
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of 
matter, or any new and useful improvement 
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to 
the conditions and requirements of this title.

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

35 U.S.C. § 101. The statute thus recites four 
categories of patent-eligible subject matter: processes, 
machines, manufactures, and compositions 
of matter. It is undisputed that Applicants' claims 
are not directed to a machine, manufacture, or com


FN2

position of matter.Thus, the issue before us involves 
what the term “process” in § 101 means, and 
how to determine whether a given claim-and Applicants' 
claim 1 in particular-is a “new and useful 

FN3

process.” 

FN2. As a result, we decline to discuss In 
re Nuijten because that decision primarily 
concerned whether a claim to an electronic 
signal was drawn to a patent-eligible manufacture. 
500 F.3d 1346, 1356-57 
(Fed.Cir.2007). We note that the PTO did 
not dispute that the process claims in Nuijten 
were drawn to patent-eligible subject 
matter under § 101 and allowed those 
claims. 

FN3. Congress provided a definition of 
“process” in 35 U.S.C. § 100(b): “The term 
‘process' means process, art or method, 
and includes a new use of a known process, 
machine, manufacture, composition 
of matter, or material.” However, this provision 
is unhelpful given that the definition 
itself uses the term “process.” 

As several amici have argued, the term 
“process” is ordinarily broad in meaning, at least in 
general lay usage. In 1952, at the time Congress 

FN4

amended § 101 to include “process,” the ordinary 
meaning of *952 the term was: “[a] procedure 
... [a] series of actions, motions, or operations 
definitely conducing to an end, whether voluntary 
or involuntary.” WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL 
DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH 
LANGUAGE 1972 (2d ed.1952). There can be no 
dispute that Applicants' claim would meet this 
definition of “process.” But the Supreme Court has 
held that the meaning of “process” as used in § 101 
is narrower than its ordinary meaning. See Flook, 
437 U.S. at 588-89, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (“The holding [in 

Benson ] forecloses a purely literal reading of § 101 
.”). Specifically, the Court has held that a claim is 
not a patent-eligible “process” if it claims “laws of 
nature, natural phenomena, [or] abstract ideas.” 

Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 185, 101 S.Ct. 
1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981) (citing Flook, 437 

U.S. at 589, 98 S.Ct. 2522, and Gottschalk v. Benson, 
409 U.S. 63, 67, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 
FN5

(1972)). Such fundamental principles are “part 
of the storehouse of knowledge of all men ... free to 
all men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk 
Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 
130, 68 S.Ct. 440, 92 L.Ed. 588 (1948); see also Le 
Roy v. Tatham, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 175, 14 
L.Ed. 367 (1852) (“A principle, in the abstract, is a 
fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; 
these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in 
either of them an exclusive right.”). “Phenomena of 
nature, though just discovered, mental processes, 
and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, 
as they are the basic tools of scientific and 
technological work.” Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 
S.Ct. 253; see also Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1378-79 
(holding that “mental processes,” “processes of human 
thinking,” and “systems that depend for their 
operation on human intelligence alone” are not patent-
eligible subject matter under Benson ). 

FN4. The Patent Act of 1793 originally 
used the term “art” rather than “process,” 
which remained unchanged until Congress 
enacted the current version of § 101 in 
1952. But the Supreme Court has held that 
this change did not alter the scope of patent 
eligibility over processes because “[i]n 
the language of the patent law, [a process] 
is an art.” Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 
182-84, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 
(1981) (quoting Cochrane v. Deener, 94 

U.S. 780, 787-88, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1877)); 
see also Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1375. 
FN5. As used in this opinion, 
“fundamental principles” means “laws of 
nature, natural phenomena, and abstract

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

ideas.” 

The true issue before us then is whether Applicants 
are seeking to claim a fundamental principle 
(such as an abstract idea) or a mental process. 
And the underlying legal question thus presented is 
what test or set of criteria governs the determination 
by the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) 
or courts as to whether a claim to a process is patentable 
under § 101 or, conversely, is drawn to unpatentable 
subject matter because it claims only a 
fundamental principle. 

The Supreme Court last addressed this issue in 
1981 in Diehr, which concerned a patent application 
seeking to claim a process for producing cured 
synthetic rubber products. 450 U.S. at 177-79, 101 
S.Ct. 1048. The claimed process took temperature 
readings during cure and used a mathematical algorithm, 
the Arrhenius equation, to calculate the 
time when curing would be complete. Id. Noting 
that a mathematical algorithm alone is unpatentable 
because mathematical relationships are akin to a 
law of nature, the Court nevertheless held that the 
claimed process was patent-eligible subject matter, 
stating: 

[The inventors] do not seek to patent a mathematical 
formula. Instead, they seek patent protection 
for a process of curing synthetic rubber. Their 
process admittedly employs a well-known mathematical 
equation, but they do not seek to preempt 
the use of that equation. Rather, they seek 
only to foreclose from others the use of that equation 
in conjunction with all of the other steps in 
their claimed process. 

*953Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (emphasis ad


FN6 

ded) . The Court declared that while a claim 
drawn to a fundamental principle is unpatentable, 
“an application of a law of nature or mathematical 
formula to a known structure or process may well 
be deserving of patent protection.” Id. (emphasis in 
original); see also Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio 
Corp. of Am., 306 U.S. 86, 94, 59 S.Ct. 427, 83 
L.Ed. 506 (1939) (“While a scientific truth, or the 

mathematical expression of it, is not a patentable 
invention, a novel and useful structure created with 
the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.”). 

FN6. Mathematical algorithms have, in 
other cases, been identified instead as abstract 
ideas rather than laws of nature. See, 
e.g., State St., 149 F.3d at 1373. Whether 
either or both views are correct is immaterial 
since both laws of nature and abstract 
ideas are unpatentable under § 101. Diehr, 
450 U.S. at 185, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 

The Court in Diehr thus drew a distinction 
between those claims that “seek to pre-empt the use 
of” a fundamental principle, on the one hand, and 
claims that seek only to foreclose others from using 
a particular “application ” of that fundamental principle, 
on the other. 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
Patents, by definition, grant the power to exclude 
others from practicing that which the patent claims. 
Diehr can be understood to suggest that whether a 
claim is drawn only to a fundamental principle is 
essentially an inquiry into the scope of that exclusion; 
i.e., whether the effect of allowing the claim 
would be to allow the patentee to pre-empt substantially 
all uses of that fundamental principle. If so, 
the claim is not drawn to patent-eligible subject 
matter. 

In Diehr, the Court held that the claims at issue 
did not pre-empt all uses of the Arrhenius equation 
but rather claimed only “a process for curing rubber 
... which incorporates in it a more efficient solution 
of the equation.” 450 U.S. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
The process as claimed included several specific 
steps to control the curing of rubber more precisely: 
“These include installing rubber in a press, closing 
the mold, constantly determining the temperature of 
the mold, constantly recalculating the appropriate 
cure time through the use of the formula and a digital 
computer, and automatically opening the press 
at the proper time.” Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
Thus, one would still be able to use the Arrhenius 
equation in any process not involving curing rubber, 
and more importantly, even in any process to

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

cure rubber that did not include performing “all of 
the other steps in their claimed process.” See id.; 
see also Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707, 729, 26 
L.Ed. 279 (1880) (holding patentable a process of 
breaking down fat molecules into fatty acids and 
glycerine in water specifically requiring both high 
heat and high pressure since other processes, 
known or as yet unknown, using the reaction of water 
and fat molecules were not claimed). 

In contrast to Diehr, the earlier Benson case 
presented the Court with claims drawn to a process 
of converting data in binary-coded decimal 
(“BCD”) format to pure binary format via an algorithm 
programmed onto a digital computer. Benson, 
409 U.S. at 65, 93 S.Ct. 253. The Court held 
the claims to be drawn to unpatentable subject matter: 


It is conceded that one may not patent an idea. 
But in practical effect that would be the result if 
the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure 
binary numerals were patented in this case. The 
mathematical formula involved here has no substantial 
practical application except in connection 
with a digital computer, which means that if the 
judgment below is affirmed, the patent would 
wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula*954 
and in practical effect would be a patent on the 
algorithm itself. 

Id. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253 (emphasis added). 
Because the algorithm had no uses other than those 
that would be covered by the claims (i.e., any conversion 
of BCD to pure binary on a digital computer), 
the claims pre-empted all uses of the algorithm 
and thus they were effectively drawn to the 
algorithm itself. See also O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. 
(15 How.) 62, 113, 14 L.Ed. 601 (1853) (holding 
ineligible a claim pre-empting all uses of electromagnetism 
to print characters at a distance). 

The question before us then is whether Applicants' 
claim recites a fundamental principle and, if 
so, whether it would pre-empt substantially all uses 
of that fundamental principle if allowed. Unfortu


nately, this inquiry is hardly straightforward. How 
does one determine whether a given claim would 
pre-empt all uses of a fundamental principle? Analogizing 
to the facts of Diehr or Benson is of limited 
usefulness because the more challenging process 
claims of the twenty-first century are seldom 
so clearly limited in scope as the highly specific, 
plainly corporeal industrial manufacturing process 
of Diehr; nor are they typically as broadly claimed 
or purely abstract and mathematical as the algorithm 
of Benson. 

[5][6] The Supreme Court, however, has enunciated 
a definitive test to determine whether a process 
claim is tailored narrowly enough to encompass 
only a particular application of a fundamental 
principle rather than to pre-empt the principle itself. 
A claimed process is surely patent-eligible under § 
101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, 
or (2) it transforms a particular article into 
a different state or thing. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 
70, 93 S.Ct. 253 (“Transformation and reduction of 
an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is the clue to 
the patentability of a process claim that does not include 
particular machines.”); Diehr, 450 U.S. at 
192, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (holding that use of mathematical 
formula in process “transforming or reducing 
an article to a different state or thing” constitutes 
patent-eligible subject matter); see also Flook, 437 

U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (“An argument can 
be made [that the Supreme] Court has only recognized 
a process as within the statutory definition 
when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or 
operated to change materials to a ‘different state or 
thing’ ”); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 
L.Ed. 139 (1876) (“A process is ... an act, or a 
series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to 
be transformed and reduced to a different state or 
FN7

thing.”).A claimed process involving a fundamental 
principle that uses a particular machine or 
apparatus would not pre-empt uses of the principle 
that do not also use the specified machine or apparatus 
in the manner claimed. And a claimed process 
that transforms a particular article to a specified 
different state or thing by applying a fundamental

principle would not pre-empt the use of the principle 
to transform any other article, to transform the 
same article but in a manner not covered by the 
claim, or to do anything other than transform the 
specified article. 

FN7. While the Court did not give explicit 
definitions of terms such as “tied to,” 
“transforms,” or “article,” a careful analysis 
of its opinions and the subsequent jurisprudence 
of this court applying those decisions, 
discussed infra, informs our understanding 
of the Court's machine-
or-transformation test. 

The process claimed in Diehr, for example, 
clearly met both criteria. The process operated on a 
computerized rubber curing apparatus and transformed 
raw, uncured rubber into molded, cured 
rubber products. *955Diehr, 450 U.S. at 184, 187, 
101 S.Ct. 1048. The claim at issue in Flook, in contrast, 
was directed to using a particular mathematical 
formula to calculate an “alarm limit”-a value that 
would indicate an abnormal condition during an unspecified 
chemical reaction. 437 U.S. at 586, 98 
S.Ct. 2522. The Court rejected the claim as drawn 
to the formula itself because the claim did not include 
any limitations specifying “how to select the 
appropriate margin of safety, the weighting factor, 
or any of the other variables ... the chemical processes 
at work, the [mechanism for] monitoring of 
process variables, or the means of setting off an 
alarm or adjusting an alarm system.” See id. at 586, 
595, 98 S.Ct. 2522. The claim thus was not limited 
to any particular chemical (or other) transformation; 
nor was it tied to any specific machine or apparatus 
for any of its process steps, such as the selection 
or monitoring of variables or the setting off 

FN8

or adjusting of the alarm.See id. 

FN8. To the extent it may be argued that 
Flook did not explicitly follow the machine-
or-transformation test first articulated 
in Benson, we note that the more recent 
decision in Diehr reaffirmed the machine-
or-transformation test. See Diehr, 

450 U.S. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
Moreover, the Diehr Court explained that 
Flook “presented a similar situation” to 
Benson and considered it consistent with 
the holdings of Diehr and Benson. Diehr at 
186-87, 189, 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048. We 
thus follow the Diehr Court's understanding 
of Flook. 

A canvas of earlier Supreme Court cases reveals 
that the results of those decisions were also 
consistent with the machine-or-transformation test 
later articulated in Benson and reaffirmed in Diehr. 
See Tilghman, 102 U.S. at 729 (particular process 
of transforming fats into constituent compounds 
held patentable); Cochrane, 94 U.S. at 785-88 
(process transforming grain meal into purified flour 
held patentable); Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) at 113 
(process of using electromagnetism to print characters 
at a distance that was not transformative or tied 
to any particular apparatus held unpatentable). Interestingly, 
Benson presents a difficult case under 
its own test in that the claimed process operated on 
a machine, a digital computer, but was still held to 

FN9

be ineligible subject matter.However, in Benson, 
the limitations tying the process to a computer 
were not actually limiting because the fundamental 
principle at issue, a particular algorithm, had no 
utility other than operating on a digital computer. 
Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253. Thus, the 
claim's tie to a digital computer did not reduce the 
pre-emptive footprint of the claim since all uses of 
the algorithm were still covered by the claim. 

FN9. We acknowledge that the Supreme 
Court in Benson stated that the claims at 
issue “were not limited ... to any particular 
apparatus or machinery.” 409 U.S. at 64, 
93 S.Ct. 253. However, the Court immediately 
thereafter stated: “[The claims] purported 
to cover any use of the claimed 
method in a general-purpose digital computer 
of any type.” Id. And, as discussed 
herein, the Court relied for its holding on 
its understanding that the claimed process

pre-empted all uses of the recited algorithm 
because its only possible use was 
on a digital computer. Id. at 71-72, 93 
S.Ct. 253. The Diehr Court, in discussing 
Benson, relied only on this latter understanding 
of the Benson claims. See Diehr, 
450 U.S. at 185-87, 101 S.Ct. 1048. We 
must do the same. 

B. 
FN10

Applicants and several amici have argued 
that the Supreme Court did not intend the machine-
or-transformation test to be the sole test governing 
§ 101 analyses. As already noted, however, 
the Court explicitly stated in Benson that 
“[t]ransformation and reduction of an article ‘to a 
*956 different state or thing’ is the clue to the patentability 
of a process claim that does not include 

FN11

particular machines.” 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 
253 (emphasis added). And the Court itself later 
noted in Flook that at least so far it had “only recognized 
a process as within the statutory definition 
when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or 
operated to change materials to a ‘different state or 
thing.’ ” 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522. Finally, 
the Court in Diehr once again applied the 
machine-or-transformation test in its most recent 
decision regarding the patentability of processes 
under § 101. 450 U.S. at 184, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 

FN10. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Am. 
Intellectual Prop. Law Ass'n at 17-21; Br. 
of Amicus Curiae Regulatory Datacorp, 
Inc. at 10-15. 

FN11. We believe that the Supreme Court 
spoke of the machine-or-transformation 
test as the “clue” to patent-eligibility because 
the test is the tool used to determine 
whether a claim is drawn to a statutory 
“process”-the statute does not itself explicitly 
mention machine implementation or 
transformation. We do not consider the 
word “clue” to indicate that the machine-
or-implementation test is optional or 
merely advisory. Rather, the Court de


scribed it as the clue, not merely “a” clue. 
See Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253. 

We recognize, however, that the Court was initially 
equivocal in first putting forward this test in 
Benson. As the Applicants and several amici point 
out, the Court there stated: 

It is argued that a process patent must either be 
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must 
operate to change articles or materials to a 
‘different state or thing.’ We do not hold that no 
process patent could ever qualify if it did not 
meet the requirements of our prior precedents. 

Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. In Flook, 
the Court took note that this statement had been 
made in Benson but merely stated: “As in Benson, 
we assume that a valid process patent may issue 
even if it does not meet [the machine-
or-transformation test].” 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 
S.Ct. 2522 (emphasis added). And this caveat was 
not repeated in Diehr when the Court reaffirmed 
the machine-or-transformation test. See Diehr, 450 

U.S. at 184, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (quoting Benson, 409 
U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253) (“Transformation and reduction 
of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is 
the clue to the patentability of a process claim that 
does not include particular machines.”). Therefore, 
we believe our reliance on the Supreme Court's machine-
or-transformation test as the applicable test 
for § 101 analyses of process claims is sound. 
Nevertheless, we agree that future developments 
in technology and the sciences may present 
difficult challenges to the machine-
or-transformation test, just as the widespread use of 
computers and the advent of the Internet has begun 
to challenge it in the past decade. Thus, we recognize 
that the Supreme Court may ultimately decide 
to alter or perhaps even set aside this test to accommodate 
emerging technologies. And we certainly 
do not rule out the possibility that this court may in 
the future refine or augment the test or how it is applied. 
At present, however, and certainly for the 
present case, we see no need for such a departure

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

and reaffirm that the machine-or-transformation 
test, properly applied, is the governing test for determining 
patent eligibility of a process under § 101 

FN12 

. 

FN12. The Diehr Court stated: “[W]hen a 
claim containing a mathematical formula 
implements or applies that formula in a 
structure or process which, when considered 
as a whole, is performing a function 
which the patent laws were designed 
to protect (e.g., transforming or reducing 
an article to a different state or thing ), 
then the claim satisfies the requirements of 
§ 101.” 450 U.S at 192, 101 S.Ct. 1048 
(emphases added). When read together 
with Benson and Flook, on which the 
Diehr Court firmly relied, we believe this 
statement is consistent with the machine-
or-transformation test. But as we noted in 
AT& T, language such as the use of “e.g.” 
may indicate the Supreme Court's recognition 
that the machine-or-transformation 
test might require modification in the future. 
See AT & T, 172 F.3d at 1358-59. 

*957 C. 

[7][8] As a corollary, the Diehr Court also held 
that mere field-of-use limitations are generally insufficient 
to render an otherwise ineligible process 
claim patent-eligible. See 450 U.S. at 191-92, 101 
S.Ct. 1048 (noting that ineligibility under § 101 
“cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the 
use of the formula to a particular technological environment”). 
We recognize that tension may be 
seen between this consideration and the Court's 
overall goal of preventing the wholesale preemption 
of fundamental principles. Why not permit 
patentees to avoid overbroad pre-emption by limiting 
claim scope to particular fields of use? This tension 
is resolved, however, by recalling the purpose 
behind the Supreme Court's discussion of preemption, 
namely that pre-emption is merely an indication 
that a claim seeks to cover a fundamental 
principle itself rather than only a specific applica


tion of that principle. See id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 
1048; Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253. Preemption 
of all uses of a fundamental principle in all 
fields and pre-emption of all uses of the principle in 
only one field both indicate that the claim is not 
limited to a particular application of the principle. 
See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 193 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 1048 
(“A mathematical formula in the abstract is non-
statutory subject matter regardless of whether the 
patent is intended to cover all uses of the formula or 
only limited uses.”) (emphasis added). In contrast, a 
claim that is tied to a particular machine or brings 
about a particular transformation of a particular article 
does not pre-empt all uses of a fundamental 
principle in any field but rather is limited to a particular 
use, a specific application. Therefore, it is 
not drawn to the principle in the abstract. 

[9] The Diehr Court also reaffirmed a second 
corollary to the machine-or-transformation test by 
stating that “insignificant postsolution activity will 
not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable 
process.” Id. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048; see 
also Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (“The 
notion that post-solution activity, no matter how 
conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an 
unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts 
form over substance.”). The Court in Flook 
reasoned: 
A competent draftsman could attach some form 
of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical 
formula; the Pythagorean theorem would not 
have been patentable, or partially patentable, because 
a patent application contained a final step 
indicating that the formula, when solved, could 
be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques. 


FN13

437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522.Therefore, 
even if a claim recites a specific machine or a 
particular transformation of a specific article, the 
recited machine or transformation must not constitute 
mere “insignificant postsolution activity.”

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

FN13. The example of the Pythagorean 
theorem applied to surveying techniques 
could also be considered an example of a 
mere field-of-use limitation. 

FN14. Although the Court spoke of 
“postsolution” activity, we have recognized 
that the Court's reasoning is equally 
applicable to any insignificant extra-
solution activity regardless of where and 
when it appears in the claimed process. See 

In re Schrader, 22 F.3d 290, 294 
(Fed.Cir.1994) (holding a simple recordation 
step in the middle of the claimed process 
incapable of imparting patent-eligibility 
under § 101); In re Grams, 888 
F.2d 835, 839-40 (Fed.Cir.1989) (holding 
a pre-solution step of gathering data incapable 
of imparting patent-eligibility under § 
101). 

*958 D. 

We discern two other important aspects of the 
Supreme Court's § 101 jurisprudence. First, the 
Court has held that whether a claimed process is 
novel or non-obvious is irrelevant to the § 101 analysis. 
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 188-91, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
Rather, such considerations are governed by 35 

U.S.C. § 102 (novelty) and § 103 
(non-obviousness). Diehr, 450 U.S. at 188-91, 101 
S.Ct. 1048. Although § 101 refers to “new and useful” 
processes, it is overall “a general statement of 
the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent 
protection ‘subject to the conditions and requirements 
of this title.’ ” Diehr, 450 U.S. at 189, 101 
S.Ct. 1048 (quoting § 101). As the legislative history 
of § 101 indicates, Congress did not intend the 
“new and useful” language of § 101 to constitute an 
independent requirement of novelty or non-
obviousness distinct from the more specific and detailed 
requirements of §§ 102 and 103, respectively. 
FN15

Diehr, 450 U.S. at 190-91, 101 S.Ct. 1048.So 
here, it is irrelevant to the § 101 analysis whether 
Applicants' claimed process is novel or non-obvious. 


FN15. By the same token, considerations 
of adequate written description, enablement, 
best mode, etc., are also irrelevant to 
the § 101 analysis because they, too, are 
governed by other provisions of the Patent 
Act. Section 101 does, however, allow for 
patents only on useful inventions. Brenner 

v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 532-35, 86 S.Ct. 
1033, 16 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966). 
[10][11] Second, the Court has made clear that 
it is inappropriate to determine the patent-eligibility 
of a claim as a whole based on whether selected 
limitations constitute patent-eligible subject matter. 
Flook, 437 U.S. at 594, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (“Our approach 
to respondent's application is, however, not 
at all inconsistent with the view that a patent claim 
must be considered as a whole.”); Diehr, 450 U.S. 
at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (“It is inappropriate to dissect 
the claims into old and new elements and then 
to ignore the presence of the old elements in the 
analysis.”). After all, even though a fundamental 
principle itself is not patent-eligible, processes incorporating 
a fundamental principle may be patent-
eligible. Thus, it is irrelevant that any individual 
step or limitation of such processes by itself would 
be unpatentable under § 101. See In re Alappat, 33 
F.3d 1526, 1543-44 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en banc) 
(citing Diehr, 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048). 

III. 
In the years following the Supreme Court's decisions 
in Benson, Flook, and Diehr, our predecessor 
court and this court have reviewed numerous 
cases presenting a wide variety of process claims, 
some in technology areas unimaginable when those 

FN16

seminal Supreme Court cases were heard. 
Looking to these precedents, we find a wealth of 
detailed guidance and helpful examples on how to 
determine the patent-eligibility of process claims. 

FN16. We note that the PTO, too, has been 
active in analyzing § 101 law. See, e.g., Ex 
parte Lundgren, 76 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 
(B.P.A.I.2004); Interim Guidelines for Examination 
of Patent Applications for Patent

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

Subject Matter Eligibility, Off. Gaz. Pat. & 
Trademark Office, Nov. 22, 2005. 

A. 
[12] Before we turn to our precedents, 
however, we first address the issue of whether several 
other purported articulations of § 101 tests are 
valid and useful. The first of these is known as the 
Freeman-Walter-Abele test after the three decisions*
959 of our predecessor court that formulated 
and then refined the test: In re Freeman, 573 
F.2d 1237 (CCPA 1978); In re Walter, 618 F.2d 
758 (CCPA 1980); and In re Abele, 684 F.2d 902 
(CCPA 1982). This test, in its final form, had two 
steps: (1) determining whether the claim recites an 
“algorithm” within the meaning of Benson, then (2) 
determining whether that algorithm is “applied in 
any manner to physical elements or process steps.” 
Abele, 684 F.2d at 905-07. 
Some may question the continued viability of 
this test, arguing that it appears to conflict with the 
Supreme Court's proscription against dissecting a 
claim and evaluating patent-eligibility on the basis 
of individual limitations. See Flook, 437 U.S. at 
594, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (requiring analysis of claim as a 
whole in § 101 analysis); see also AT & T, 172 F.3d 
at 1359; State St., 149 F.3d at 1374. In light of the 
present opinion, we conclude that the FreemanWalter-
Abele test is inadequate. Indeed, we have 
already recognized that a claim failing that test may 
nonetheless be patent-eligible. See In re Grams, 
888 F.2d 835, 838-39 (Fed.Cir.1989). Rather, the 
machine-or-transformation test is the applicable test 

FN17

for patent-eligible subject matter.

FN17. Therefore, in Abele, Meyer, Grams, 
Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc. v. 
Corazonix Corp., 958 F.2d 1053 
(Fed.Cir.1992), and other decisions, those 
portions relying solely on the FreemanWalter-
Abele test should no longer be relied 
on. 

[13] The second articulation we now revisit is 
the “useful, concrete, and tangible result” language 
associated with State Street, although first set forth 
in Alappat. State St., 149 F.3d at 1373 (“Today, we 
hold that the transformation of data, representing 
discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a 
series of mathematical calculations into a final 
share price, constitutes a [patent-eligible invention] 
because it produces ‘a useful, concrete and tangible 

FN18

result’....”); Alappat, 33 F.3d at 1544 (“This 
is not a disembodied mathematical concept which 
may be characterized as an ‘abstract idea,’ but 
rather a specific machine to produce a useful, concrete, 
and tangible result.”); see also AT & T, 172 
F.3d at 1357 (“Because the claimed process applies 
the Boolean principle to produce a useful, concrete, 
tangible result without pre-empting other uses of 
the mathematical principle, on its face the claimed 
process comfortably falls within the scope of § 101 
.”). The basis for this language in State Street and 
Alappat was that the Supreme Court has explained 
that “certain types of mathematical subject matter, 
standing alone, represent nothing more than abstract 
ideas until reduced to some type of practical 
application.” Alappat, 33 F.3d at 1543; see also 
State St., 149 F.3d at 1373. To be sure, a process 
tied to a particular machine, or transforming or reducing 
a particular article into a different state or 
thing, will generally produce a “concrete” and 
“tangible” result as those terms were used in our 
prior decisions. But while looking for “a useful, 
concrete and tangible result” may in many instances 
provide useful indications of whether a claim is 
drawn to a fundamental principle or a practical application 
of such a principle, that inquiry is insufficient 
to determine whether a claim is patent-eligible 
under § 101. And it was certainly never intended to 
supplant the Supreme Court's test. Therefore, we 
also conclude that the “useful, concrete and tangible 
result” inquiry*960 is inadequate and reaffirm 
that the machine-or-transformation test outlined by 

FN19

the Supreme Court is the proper test to apply. 

FN18. In State Street, as is often forgotten, 
we addressed a claim drawn not to a process 
but to a machine. 149 F.3d at 1371-72 
(holding that the means-plus-function ele

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

ments of the claims on appeal all corresponded 
to supporting structures disclosed 
in the written description). 

FN19. As a result, those portions of our 
opinions in State Street and AT & T relying 
solely on a “useful, concrete and tangible 
result” analysis should no longer be relied 
on. 

We next turn to the so-called “technological 

FN20

arts test” that some amici urge us to adopt. 
We perceive that the contours of such a test, 
however, would be unclear because the meanings of 
the terms “technological arts” and “technology” are 

FN21

both ambiguous and ever-changing. And no 
such test has ever been explicitly adopted by the 
Supreme Court, this court, or our predecessor court, 
as the Board correctly observed here. Therefore, we 
decline to do so and continue to rely on the machine-
or-transformation test as articulated by the 
Supreme Court. 

FN20. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae 
Consumers Union et al. at 6-10; Br. of 
Amicus Curiae William Mitchell Coll. of 
Law Intellectual Prop. Inst. at 14-15. 

FN21. Compare Appellee's Br. at 24-28 
(arguing that patents should be reserved 
only for “technological” inventions that 
“involve[ ] the application of science or 
mathematics,” thereby excluding 
“non-technological inventions” such as 
“activities whose ability to achieve their 
claimed goals depended solely on contract 
formation”), with Br. of Amicus Curiae 
Regulatory Datacorp, Inc. at 19-24 
(arguing that “innovations in business, finance, 
and other applied economic fields 
plainly qualify as ‘technological’ ” since 
“a fair definition of technological is 
‘characterized by the practical application 
of knowledge in a particular field’ ” and 
because modern economics has “a closer 
affinity to physics and engineering than to 

liberal arts like English literature”). 

We further reject calls for categorical exclusions 
beyond those for fundamental principles

FN22

already identified by the Supreme Court.We 
rejected just such an exclusion in State Street, noting 
that the so-called “business method exception” 
was unlawful and that business method claims (and 
indeed all process claims) are “subject to the same 
legal requirements for patentability as applied to 
any other process or method.” 149 F.3d at 1375-76. 

FN23

We reaffirm this conclusion.

FN22. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Fin. 
Servs. Indus. at 20 (“[E]xtending patent 
protection to pure methods of doing business 
... is contrary to the constitutional and 
statutory basis for granting patent monopolies....”). 


FN23. Therefore, although invited to do so 
by several amici, we decline to adopt a 
broad exclusion over software or any other 
such category of subject matter beyond the 
exclusion of claims drawn to fundamental 
principles set forth by the Supreme Court. 
See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae End Software 
Patents; Br. of Amicus Curiae Red 
Hat, Inc. at 4-7. We also note that the process 
claim at issue in this appeal is not, in 
any event, a software claim. Thus, the facts 
here would be largely unhelpful in illuminating 
the distinctions between those software 
claims that are patent-eligible and 
those that are not. 

Lastly, we address a possible misunderstanding 
of our decision in Comiskey. Some may suggest 
that Comiskey implicitly applied a new § 101 test 
that bars any claim reciting a mental process that 
lacks significant “physical steps.” We did not so 
hold, nor did we announce any new test at all in 
Comiskey. Rather, we simply recognized that the 
Supreme Court has held that mental processes, like 
fundamental principles, are excluded by § 101 because

covered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual 
concepts ... are the basic tools of scientific and 
technological work.’ ” Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1377 
(quoting Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253) 
(emphasis added). And we actually applied the machine-
or-transformation test to determine whether 
various claims at issue were *961 drawn to patent


FN24

eligible subject matter.Id. at 1379 
(“Comiskey has conceded that these claims do not 
require a machine, and these claims evidently do 
not describe a process of manufacture or a process 
for the alteration of a composition of matter.”). Because 
those claims failed the machine-
or-transformation test, we held that they were 
drawn solely to a fundamental principle, the mental 
process of arbitrating a dispute, and were thus not 
patent-eligible under § 101. Id. 

FN24. Our statement in Comiskey that “a 
claim reciting an algorithm or abstract idea 
can state statutory subject matter only if, as 
employed in the process, it is embodied in, 
operates on, transforms, or otherwise involves 
another class of statutory subject 
matter, i.e., a machine, manufacture, or 
composition of matter,” 499 F.3d at 1376, 
was simply a summarization of the Supreme 
Court's machine-or-transformation 
test and should not be understood as altering 
that test. 

[14][15] Further, not only did we not rely on a 
“physical steps” test in Comiskey, but we have criticized 
such an approach to the § 101 analysis in 
earlier decisions. In AT & T, we rejected a 
“physical limitations” test and noted that “the mere 
fact that a claimed invention involves inputting 
numbers, calculating numbers, outputting numbers, 
and storing numbers, in and of itself, would not 
render it nonstatutory subject matter.” 172 F.3d at 
1359 (quoting State St., 149 F.3d at 1374). The 
same reasoning applies when the claim at issue recites 
fundamental principles other than mathematical 
algorithms. Thus, the proper inquiry under § 101 
is not whether the process claim recites sufficient 

“physical steps,” but rather whether the claim meets 

FN25

the machine-or-transformation test.As a result, 
even a claim that recites “physical steps” but 
neither recites a particular machine or apparatus, 
nor transforms any article into a different state or 
thing, is not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter. 
Conversely, a claim that purportedly lacks any 
“physical steps” but is still tied to a machine or 
achieves an eligible transformation passes muster 

FN26

under § 101. 

FN25. Thus, it is simply inapposite to the § 
101 analysis whether process steps performed 
by software on a computer are sufficiently 
“physical.” 

FN26. Of course, a claimed process 
wherein all of the process steps may be 
performed entirely in the human mind is 
obviously not tied to any machine and does 
not transform any article into a different 
state or thing. As a result, it would not be 
patent-eligible under § 101. 

B. 
With these preliminary issues resolved, we now 
turn to how our case law elaborates on the § 101 
analysis set forth by the Supreme Court. To the extent 
that some of the reasoning in these decisions 
relied on considerations or tests, such as “useful, 
concrete and tangible result,” that are no longer valid 
as explained above, those aspects of the decisions 
should no longer be relied on. Thus, we 
reexamine the facts of certain cases under the correct 
test to glean greater guidance as to how to perform 
the § 101 analysis using the machine-
or-transformation test. 

[16][17][18] The machine-or-transformation 
test is a two-branched inquiry; an applicant may 
show that a process claim satisfies § 101 either by 
showing that his claim is tied to a particular machine, 
or by showing that his claim transforms an 
article. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253. 
Certain considerations are applicable to analysis 
under either branch. First, as illustrated by Benson

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 20 

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

and discussed below, the use of a specific machine 
or transformation of an article must impose meaningful 
limits on the claim's scope to impart patent-
eligibility. See *962Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93 
S.Ct. 253. Second, the involvement of the machine 
or transformation in the claimed process must not 
merely be insignificant extra-solution activity. See 
Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522. 

As to machine implementation, Applicants 
themselves admit that the language of claim 1 does 
not limit any process step to any specific machine 
or apparatus. See Appellants' Br. at 11. As a result, 
issues specific to the machine implementation part 
of the test are not before us today. We leave to future 
cases the elaboration of the precise contours of 
machine implementation, as well as the answers to 
particular questions, such as whether or when recitation 
of a computer suffices to tie a process claim 
to a particular machine. 

[19][20] We will, however, consider some of 
our past cases to gain insight into the transformation 
part of the test. A claimed process is patent-
eligible if it transforms an article into a different 
state or thing. This transformation must be central 
to the purpose of the claimed process. But the main 
aspect of the transformation test that requires clarification 
here is what sorts of things constitute 
“articles” such that their transformation is sufficient 
to impart patent-eligibility under § 101. It is virtually 
self-evident that a process for a chemical or 
physical transformation of physical objects or substances 
is patent-eligible subject matter. As the Supreme 
Court stated in Benson: 

[T]he arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof 
cloth, vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores ... 
are instances, however, where the use of chemical 
substances or physical acts, such as temperature 
control, changes articles or materials. The 
chemical process or the physical acts which 
transform the raw material are, however, sufficiently 
definite to confine the patent monopoly 
within rather definite bounds. 

409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253 (quoting Corning 

v. Burden, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 267-68, 14 L.Ed. 
683 (1854)); see also Diehr, 450 U.S. at 184, 101 
S.Ct. 1048 (process of curing rubber); Tilghman, 
102 U.S. at 729 (process of reducing fats into constituent 
acids and glycerine). 
The raw materials of many information-age 
processes, however, are electronic signals and electronically-
manipulated data. And some so-called 
business methods, such as that claimed in the 
present case, involve the manipulation of even 
more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, 
organizational relationships, and business risks. 
Which, if any, of these processes qualify as a transformation 
or reduction of an article into a different 
state or thing constituting patent-eligible subject 
matter? 

Our case law has taken a measured approach to 
this question, and we see no reason here to expand 
the boundaries of what constitutes patent-eligible 
transformations of articles. 

Our predecessor court's mixed result in Abele 
illustrates this point. There, we held unpatentable a 
broad independent claim reciting a process of 
graphically displaying variances of data from average 
values. Abele, 684 F.2d at 909. That claim did 
not specify any particular type or nature of data; 
nor did it specify how or from where the data was 
obtained or what the data represented. Id.; see also 
In re Meyer, 688 F.2d 789, 792-93 (CCPA 1982) 
(process claim involving undefined “complex system” 
and indeterminate “factors” drawn from unspecified 
“testing” not patent-eligible). In contrast, 
we held one of Abele's dependent claims to be 
drawn to patent-eligible subject matter where it 
specified that “said data is X-ray attenuation data 
produced in a two dimensional field by a computed 
tomography scanner.” Abele, 684 F.2d at 908-09. 
This data *963 clearly represented physical and tangible 
objects, namely the structure of bones, organs, 
and other body tissues. Thus, the transformation of 
that raw data into a particular visual depiction of a 
physical object on a display was sufficient to render

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

that more narrowly-claimed process patent-eligible. 

We further note for clarity that the electronic 
transformation of the data itself into a visual depiction 
in Abele was sufficient; the claim was not required 
to involve any transformation of the underlying 
physical object that the data represented. We 
believe this is faithful to the concern the Supreme 
Court articulated as the basis for the machine-
or-transformation test, namely the prevention of 
pre-emption of fundamental principles. So long as 
the claimed process is limited to a practical application 
of a fundamental principle to transform specific 
data, and the claim is limited to a visual depiction 
that represents specific physical objects or substances, 
there is no danger that the scope of the 
claim would wholly pre-empt all uses of the principle. 


This court and our predecessor court have frequently 
stated that adding a data-gathering step to 
an algorithm is insufficient to convert that algorithm 
into a patent-eligible process. E.g., Grams, 
888 F.2d at 840 (step of “deriv[ing] data for the algorithm 
will not render the claim statutory”); Meyer, 
688 F.2d at 794 (“[data-gathering] step[s] cannot 
make an otherwise nonstatutory claim statutory”). 
For example, in Grams we held unpatentable 
a process of performing a clinical test and, 
based on the data from that test, determining if an 
abnormality existed and possible causes of any abnormality. 
888 F.2d at 837, 841. We rejected the 
claim because it was merely an algorithm combined 
with a data-gathering step. Id. at 839-41. We note 
that, at least in most cases, gathering data would 
not constitute a transformation of any article. A requirement 
simply that data inputs be gathered-
without specifying how-is a meaningless limit on a 
claim to an algorithm because every algorithm inherently 
requires the gathering of data inputs. 
Grams, 888 F.2d at 839-40. Further, the inherent 
step of gathering data can also fairly be characterized 
as insignificant extra-solution activity. See 
Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522. 

Similarly, In re Schrader presented claims dir


ected to a method of conducting an auction of multiple 
items in which the winning bids were selected 
in a manner that maximized the total price of all the 
items (rather than to the highest individual bid for 
each item separately). 22 F.3d 290, 291 
(Fed.Cir.1994). We held the claims to be drawn to 
unpatentable subject matter, namely a mathematical 
optimization algorithm. Id. at 293-94. No specific 
machine or apparatus was recited. The claimed 
method did require a step of recording the bids on 
each item, though no particular manner of recording 
(e.g., on paper, on a computer) was specified. 
Id. But, relying on Flook, we held that this step 
constituted insignificant extra-solution activity. Id. 
at 294. 

IV. 
We now turn to the facts of this case. As outlined 
above, the operative question before this court 
is whether Applicants' claim 1 satisfies the transformation 
branch of the machine-or-transformation 
test. 

[21][22] We hold that the Applicants' process 
as claimed does not transform any article to a different 
state or thing. Purported transformations or 
manipulations simply of public or private legal obligations 
or relationships, business risks, or other 
such abstractions cannot meet the test because they 
are not physical objects or substances, and they are 
not representative of physical objects or substances. 
Applicants'*964 process at most incorporates only 
such ineligible transformations. See Appellants' Br. 
at 11 (“[The claimed process] transforms the relationships 
between the commodity provider, the consumers 
and market participants ....”) As discussed 
earlier, the process as claimed encompasses the exchange 
of only options, which are simply legal 
rights to purchase some commodity at a given price 
in a given time period. See J.A. at 86-87. The claim 
only refers to “transactions” involving the exchange 
of these legal rights at a “fixed rate corresponding 
to a risk position.” See '892 application cl.1. Thus, 
claim 1 does not involve the transformation of any 
physical object or substance, or an electronic signal

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

representative of any physical object or substance. 
Given its admitted failure to meet the machine implementation 
part of the test as well, the claim entirely 
fails the machine-or-transformation test and is 
not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter. 

Applicants' arguments are unavailing because 
they rely on incorrect or insufficient considerations 
and do not address their claim's failure to meet the 
requirements of the Supreme Court's machine-
or-transformation test. First, they argue that claim 1 
produces “useful, concrete and tangible results.” 
But as already discussed, this is insufficient to establish 
patent-eligibility under § 101. Applicants 
also argue that their claimed process does not comprise 
only “steps that are totally or substantially 
practiced in the mind but clearly require physical 
activity which have [sic] a tangible result.” Appellants' 
Br. at 9. But as previously discussed, the correct 
analysis is whether the claim meets the machine-
or-transformation test, not whether it recites 
“physical steps.” Even if it is true that Applicant's 
claim “can only be practiced by a series of physical 
acts” as they argue, see id. at 9, its clear failure to 
satisfy the machine-or-transformation test is fatal. 
Thus, while we agree with Applicants that the only 
limit to patent-eligibility imposed by Congress is 
that the invention fall within one of the four categories 
enumerated in § 101, we must apply the Supreme 
Court's test to determine whether a claim to 
a process is drawn to a statutory “process” within 
the meaning of § 101. Applied here, Applicants' 
claim fails that test so it is not drawn to a “process” 
under § 101 as that term has been interpreted. 

On the other hand, while we agree with the 
PTO that the machine-or-transformation test is the 
correct test to apply in determining whether a process 
claim is patent-eligible under § 101, we do not 
agree, as discussed earlier, that this amounts to a 
“technological arts” test. See Appellee's Br. at 
24-28. Neither the PTO nor the courts may pay 
short shrift to the machine-or-transformation test by 
using purported equivalents or shortcuts such as a 
“technological arts” requirement. Rather, the ma


chine-or-transformation test is the only applicable 
test and must be applied, in light of the guidance 
provided by the Supreme Court and this court, 
when evaluating the patent-eligibility of process 
claims. When we do so here, however, we must 
conclude, as the PTO did, that Applicants' claim 
fails the test. 

Applicants' claim is similar to the claims we 
held unpatentable under § 101 in Comiskey. There, 
the applicant claimed a process for mandatory arbitration 
of disputes regarding unilateral documents 
and bilateral “contractual” documents in which arbitration 
was required by the language of the document, 
a dispute regarding the document was arbitrated, 
and a binding decision resulted from the arbitration. 
Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1368-69. We held 
the broadest process claims unpatentable under § 
101 because “these claims do not require a machine, 
and these claims evidently do not describe a 
process of manufacture*965 or a process for the alteration 
of a composition of matter.” Id. at 1379. 
We concluded that the claims were instead drawn to 
the “mental process” of arbitrating disputes, and 
that claims to such an “application of [only] human 
intelligence to the solution of practical problems” is 
no more than a claim to a fundamental principle. Id. 
at 1377-79 (quoting Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 
S.Ct. 253 (“[M]ental processes, and abstract intellectual 
concepts are not patentable, as they are the 
basic tools of scientific and technological work.”)). 

Just as the Comiskey claims as a whole were 
directed to the mental process of arbitrating a dispute 
to decide its resolution, the claimed process 
here as a whole is directed to the mental and mathematical 
process of identifying transactions that 
would hedge risk. The fact that the claim requires 
the identified transactions actually to be made does 
no more to alter the character of the claim as a 
whole than the fact that the claims in Comiskey required 
a decision to actually be rendered in the arbitration-
i.e., in neither case do the claims require 
the use of any particular machine or achieve any 
eligible transformation.

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

We have in fact consistently rejected claims 
like those in the present appeal and in Comiskey. 
For example, in Meyer, the applicant sought to patent 
a method of diagnosing the location of a malfunction 
in an unspecified multi-component system 
that assigned a numerical value, a “factor,” to each 
component and updated that value based on diagnostic 
tests of each component. 688 F.2d at 
792-93. The locations of any malfunctions could 
thus be deduced from reviewing these “factors.” 
The diagnostic tests were not identified, and the 
“factors” were not tied to any particular measurement; 
indeed they could be arbitrary. Id. at 790. We 
held that the claim was effectively drawn only to “a 
mathematical algorithm representing a mental process,” 
and we affirmed the PTO's rejection on § 101 
grounds. Id. at 796. No machine was recited in the 
claim, and the only potential “transformation” was 
of the disembodied “factors” from one number to 
another. Thus, the claim effectively sought to preempt 
the fundamental mental process of diagnosing 
the location of a malfunction in a system by noticing 
that the condition of a particular component 
had changed. And as discussed earlier, a similar 

FN27

claim was rejected in Grams.See 888 F.2d at 
839-40 (rejecting claim to process of diagnosing 
“abnormal condition” in person by identifying and 
noticing discrepancies in results of unspecified clinical 
tests of different parts of body). 

FN27. We note that several Justices of the 
Supreme Court, in a dissent to a dismissal 
of a writ of certiorari, expressed their view 
that a similar claim in Laboratory Corp. of 
America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories, 
Inc. was drawn to unpatentable subject 
matter. 548 U.S. 124, 126 S.Ct. 2921, 
2927-28, 165 L.Ed.2d 399 (2006) (Breyer, 
J., dissenting; joined by Stevens, J., and 
Souter, J.). There, the claimed process only 
comprised the steps of: (1) “assaying a 
body fluid for an elevated level of total 
homocysteine,” and (2) “correlating an elevated 
level of total homocysteine in said 
body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin 

or folate.” Id. at 2924. 

Similarly to the situations in Meyer and Grams, 
Applicants here seek to claim a non-transformative 
process that encompasses a purely mental process 
of performing requisite mathematical calculations 
without the aid of a computer or any other device, 
mentally identifying those transactions that the calculations 
have revealed would hedge each other's 
risks, and performing the post-solution step of consummating 
those transactions. Therefore, claim 1 
would effectively pre-empt any application of the 
fundamental concept of hedging and mathematical 
calculations inherent*966 in hedging (not even limited 
to any particular mathematical formula). And 
while Applicants argue that the scope of this preemption 
is limited to hedging as applied in the area 
of consumable commodities, the Supreme Court's 
reasoning has made clear that effective pre-emption 
of all applications of hedging even just within the 
area of consumable commodities is impermissible. 
See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048 
(holding that field-of-use limitations are insufficient 
to impart patent-eligibility to otherwise unpatentable 
claims drawn to fundamental principles). 
Moreover, while the claimed process contains physical 
steps (initiating, identifying), it does not involve 
transforming an article into a different state 
or thing. Therefore, Applicants' claim is not drawn 
to patent-eligible subject matter under § 101. 

CONCLUSION 

Because the applicable test to determine whether 
a claim is drawn to a patent-eligible process under 
§ 101 is the machine-or-transformation test set 
forth by the Supreme Court and clarified herein, 
and Applicants' claim here plainly fails that test, the 
decision of the Board is 

AFFIRMED.

the statute, but rather “usurps the legislative role.”

In fact, the unpatentability of processes not involving 
manufactures, machines, or compositions 
of matter has been firmly embedded in the statute 
since the time of the Patent Act of 1793, ch. 11, 1 
Stat. 318 (1793). It is our dissenting colleagues who 
would legislate by expanding patentable subject 
matter far beyond what is allowed by the statute. 

FN1. The dissents fault the majority for 
“ventur[ing] away from the statute,” 
Rader, J., dissenting op. at 1013, and 
“usurp[ing] the legislative role,” Newman, 
J., dissenting op. at 997. 

I 
Section 101 now provides: 


Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful 
process, machine, manufacture, or composition 
of matter, or any new and useful improvement 
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject 
to the conditions and requirements of this 
title. 

35 U.S.C. § 101 (emphases added). 

The current version of § 101 can be traced back 
to the Patent Act of 1793. In relevant part, the 1793 
Act stated that a patent may be granted to any person 
or persons who: 

shall allege that he or they have invented any new 
and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition 
of matter, or any new and useful improvement 
on any art, machine, manufacture or composition 
of matter.... 

1 Stat. 318, 319 § 1 (1793) (emphases added). 
The criteria for patentability established by the 
1793 Act remained essentially unchanged until 
1952, when Congress amended § 101 by replacing 
the word “art” with “process” and providing in § 
100(b) a definition of the term “process.” The Supreme 
Court has made clear that this change did not 
alter the substantive understanding of the statute; it 
did not broaden the scope of patentable subject 

FN2

matter.Thus, our interpretation of § 101 *967 
must begin with a consideration of what the drafters 
of the early patent statutes understood the patentability 
standard to require in 1793. See Diehr, 450 

U.S. at 182-83, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (looking to the 1793 
Act). 
FN2. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 
182, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 
(1981) (“[A] process has historically enjoyed 
patent protection because it was considered 
a form of ‘art’ as that term was 
used in the 1793 Act.”); Diamond v. 
Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309, 100 S.Ct. 
2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980). Rather, the 
1952 Act simply affirmed the prior judicial 
understanding, as set forth in Corning v. 
Burden, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 14 L.Ed. 
683 (1853), that Congress in 1793 had 
provided for the patentability of a 
“process” under the term “art.” Diehr, 450 

U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
A 
The patentability criteria of the 1793 Act were 
to a significant extent the same in the 1790 Act.

FN3 

The 1790 “statute was largely based on and incorporated” 
features of the English system and reveals 
a sophisticated knowledge of the English pat

ent law and practice.This is reflected in Senate 

FN5

committee report for the bill that became the 
1790 Act, which expressly noted the drafters' reliance 
on the English practice: 

FN3. In relevant part, the 1790 Act permitted 
patents upon “any useful art, manufacture, 
engine, machine, or device, or any 
improvement therein not before known or 
used.” Ch. 11, § 1, 1 Stat. 109, 110 (1790).

Likewise, the legislative history of the 1793 
Patent Act reflects the same keen understanding 
of English patent practice. During a debate in the 
House over the creation of a Patent Office, for 
example, the Representative who introduced the 
bill noted that its principles were “an imitation of 
the Patent System of Great Britain.” 3 Annals of 

FN7

Congress 855 (1793).

FN6. Neither of those two instances related 
to patentable subject matter or was adopted 
in the enacted statute. The first proposed 
departure from the English practice was a 
novelty provision protecting the inventor 
against those who derived their knowledge 
of the invention from the true inventor; the 
second was in a requirement that patentees 
make a “Public Advertisement” of their invention. 
Such a requirement was thought 
necessary “in so extensive a Country as the 
United States.” Senate Report, reprinted in 
22 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y at 363-64. 

The American statute ultimately differed 
in some other respects. For example, 
Congress rejected the English rule that 
the invention need only be novel in England. 
The American statute required nov


elty against the whole world and did not 
permit “patents of importation.” See To 
Promote the Progress, supra n. 4 at 
95-97, 137-38. 

FN7. Even the opposing view-urging departure 
from the English practice in particular 
respects-recognized that the English 
practice provided considerable guidance. 
See 3 Annals of Congress at 855-56 
(“[Great Britain] had afforded, it was true, 
much experience on the subject; but regulations 
adopted there would not exactly 
comport in all respects either with the situation 
of this country, or with the rights of 
the citizen here. The minds of some members 
had taken a wrong direction, he conceived, 
from the view in which they had 
taken up the subject under its analogy with 
the doctrine of patents in England.”); see 
also To Promote the Progress, supra n. 4 at 
216-17. 

*968 Later, Justice Story, writing for the Supreme 
Court, recognized the profound influence of 
the English practice on these early patent laws, 
which in many respects codified the common law: 

It is obvious to the careful inquirer, that many of 
the provisions of our patent act are derived from 
the principles and practice which have prevailed 
in the construction of that of England .... The language 
of [the patent clause of the Statute of 
Monopolies] is not, as we shall presently see, 
identical with ours; but the construction of it adopted 
by the English courts, and the principles 
and practice which have long regulated the 
grants of their patents, as they must have been 
known and are tacitly referred to in some of the 
provisions of our own statute, afford materials to 
illustrate it.

derives from English patent law.”). 

While Congress departed from the English 
practice in certain limited respects, in many respects 
Congress simply adopted the English practice 
without change. Both the 1790 and the 1793 
Acts, for example, adopted the same 14-year patent 
term as in England. Both also required inventors to 
file a written specification-a requirement recognized 
by the English common law courts in the 

FN8

mid-eighteenth century.In addition, as discussed 
below, the categories of patentable subject 
matter closely tracked the English approach, and in 
certain respects reflected a deliberate choice 
between competing views prevalent in England at 
the time. 

FN8. See Christine MacLeod, Inventing the 
Industrial Revolution: The English Patent 
System, 1660-1800 48-49 (2002); To Promote 
the Progress, supra n. 4 at 400, 404. 

B 

The English practice in 1793, imported into the 
American statutes, explicitly recognized a limit on 
patentable subject matter. As the Supreme Court recounted 
in Graham v. John Deere, the English concern 
about limiting the allowable scope of patents 
arose from an aversion to the odious Crown practice 
of granting patents on particular types of businesses 
to court favorites. 383 U.S. 1, 5, 86 S.Ct. 
684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); see also MacLeod, 
supra n. 8 at 15 (“But most offensive of all was the 
granting of monopoly powers in established industries, 
as a form of patronage, to courtiers whom the 
crown could not otherwise afford to reward.”). Parliament 
responded to the Crown's abuses in 1623 by 
passing the Statute of Monopolies, prohibiting the 
Crown from granting these despised industry-type 
monopolies. Not all monopolies were prohibited, 
however: the Statute expressly exempted invention-
type patent monopolies. Section 6 of the Statute ex


empted from its prohibitions “letters patent and 
grants of privilege for the term of fourteen years or 
under, hereafter to be made, of the sole working or 
making of any manner of new manufactures within 
this realm, to the true and first inventor and inventors 
of such manufactures....” 21 Jac. 1. c.3, s.6 
(emphases added). 

Each of the five categories of patentable subject 
matter recognized by the 1793 Patent Act-(1) 
“manufacture,” (2) “machine,” (3) “composition of 
matter,” (4) “any new and useful improvement,” 
and (5) “art”-*969 was drawn either from the Statute 
of Monopolies and the common law refinement 
of its interpretation or resolved competing views 
being debated in England at the time. See To Promote 
the Progress, supra n. 4 at 239. 

“ Manufacture. ” At the most basic level, the 
1793 Act, like the Statute of Monopolies, expressly 
provided for the patentability of “manufactures.” 
This language was not accidental, but rather reflected 
a conscious adoption of that term as it was used 
in the English practice. Id. (“It is clear that the Congress 
sought to incorporate into the U.S. statutory 
scheme in 1793 at least as much of the common law 
interpretation of ‘new manufactures' as was understood 
at the time.”). 

“ Machine. ” Likewise, the category of 
“machines” in the 1793 Act had long been understood 
to be within the term “manufactures” as used 
in the English statute. See id.; see, e.g., Morris v. 
Bramson, 1 Carp. P.C. 30, 31 (K.B.1776) 
(sustaining a patent “for an engine or machine on 
which is fixed a set of working needles ... for the 
making of eyelet-holes”) (emphasis added); 
MacLeod, supra n. 8 at 101 (noting, among numerous 
other early machine patents, seven patents on 
“machinery to raise coal and ores” before 1750). 

“ Composition of Matter. ” Although the 1790 
statute did not explicitly include “compositions of 
matter,” this was remedied in the 1793 statute. At 
the time, “compositions of matter” were already understood 
to be a type of manufacture patentable un

der the English statute. See To Promote the Progress, 
supra n. 4, at 224 n. 4. One example is found 
in Liardet v. Johnson, 1 Carp. P.C. 35 (K.B.1778), 
a case involving a patent on a “composition” of 
stucco (a composition of matter). Lord Mansfield's 
jury instructions noted that by the time of that trial 
he had decided “several cases” involving compositions: 
“But if ... the specification of the composition 
gives no proportions, there is an end of his patent.... 
I have determined, [in] several cases here, the specification 
must state, where there is a composition, 

FN9

the proportions....”

of the Intellectual Property Clause: A

(quoting E. Wyndham Hulme, On the History 
of the Patent Laws in the Seventeenth 
and Eighteenth Centuries, 18 L.Q. Rev. 
280, 285 (1902)). 

“Any new and useful improvement.” The reference 
to “any new and useful improvement” in the 
1793 Act also adopted a consensus recently reached 
by the English courts. The common law courts had 
first ruled in Bircot's Case in the early seventeenth 
century that an improvement to an existing machine 
could not be the proper subject of a patent under the 
Statute of Monopolies. See Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl. 
463, 488 (C.P.1795). In 1776 that line of cases was 
overruled in Morris v. Bramson, because such a 
reading of the statute “would go to repeal almost 

FN10 

every patent that was ever granted.” 

FN10. Morris, 1 Carp. P.C. at 34; see also 
Boulton, 2 H.Bl. at 489 (“Since [Morris v. 
Bramson ], it has been the generally received 
opinion in Westminster Hall, that a 
patent for an addition is good.”). 

“Art.” As the Supreme Court has recognized, a 
process “was considered a form of ‘art’ as that term 
was used in the 1793 Act.” Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 
101 S.Ct. 1048 (citing Corning v. Burden, 56 U.S. 
at 267-268). The language of the Statute of Monopolies 
permitted patents on that which could be 

characterized as the “working or making of any 
manner of new manufactures within this realm.” 21 
Jac. 1. c.3, s.6. While this language plainly applied 
to tangible “new manufactures” (such as machines 
or compositions of matter), it *970 also appeared to 
allow patenting of manufacturing processes as the “ 
working or making of any manner of new manufactures.” 
Thus, under the Statute of Monopolies patents 
could be had on the “working or making of any 
manner of new manufactures.” Numerous method 
patents had issued by 1793, including James Watt's 
famous 1769 patent on a “[m]ethod of diminishing 

FN11

the consumption of fuel in [steam]-engines.” 
However, the English courts in the mid-eighteenth 
century had not yet resolved whether processes for 
manufacturing were themselves patentable under 
the statute, and as discussed below, the issue was 
being actively litigated in the English courts. In the 
1793 Act Congress resolved this question by including 
the term “art” in the statute, adopting the 
practice of the English law officers and the views 
of those in England who favored process patents. 

FN11. Walterscheid, supra n. 9 at 355-56 
(emphasis added); see also Boulton, 2 H. 
Bl. at 494-95 (1795) (noting that many 
method patents had issued). 

II 

The question remains as to what processes 
were considered to be patentable in England at the 
time of the 1793 Act. Examination of the relevant 
sources leads to the conclusion that the method Bil-
ski seeks to claim would not have been considered 
patentable subject matter as a process under the 
English statute. 

A 

First, the language of the Statute of Monopolies-“
working or making of any manner of new manufactures 
”-suggests that only processes that related 
to “manufactures” (including machines or compositions 
of matter) could be patented. 

Second, the English patent practice before and 
contemporaneous with the 1793 Act confirms the

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

notion that patentable subject matter was limited by 
the term “manufacture” in the Statute of Monopolies 
and required a relation to the other categories of 
patentable subject matter. The organization of human 
activity was not within its bounds. Rather, the 
patents registered in England under the Statute of 
Monopolies before 1793 were limited to articles of 
manufacture, machines for manufacturing, compositions 
of matter, and related processes. A complete 
list of such patents (with a few missing patents 
from the 17th century) was published in the mid1800s 
by Bennet Woodcroft, the first head of the 

FN12

English Patent Office.Representative examples 
of patented processes at the time include: 
“Method of making a more easy and perfect division 
in stocking frame-work manufactures,” No. 
1417 to John Webb (1784); “Making and preparing 
potashes and pearl-ashes of materials not before 
used for the purpose,” No. 1223 to Richard Shannon 
(1779); “Making salt from sea-water or brine, 
by steam,” No. 1006 to Daniel Scott (1772); 
“Milling raw hides and skins so as to be equally 
good for leather as if tanned,” No. 893 to George 
Merchant (1768); “Making salt, and removing the 
corrosive nature of the same, by a separate preparation 
of the brine,” No. 416 to George Campbell 
(1717); and “Making good and merchantable tough 
iron ... with one-fifth of the expense of charcoal as 
now used,” No. 113 to Sir Phillibert Vernatt (1637). 

FN12. Bennet Woodcroft, Alphabetical Index 
of Patentees of Inventions, from March 
2, 1617 (14 James I) to October 1, 1852 
(16 Victoriae) (2d ed. 1857). 

Nothing in Woodcroft's list suggests that any of 
these hundreds of patents was on a method for organizing 
human activity, save for one aberrational 
patent discussed *971 below. Rather, the established 
practice reflects the understanding that only 
processes related to manufacturing or 
“manufactures” were within the statute. The English 
cases before 1793 recognized that the practice 
followed in issuing patents was directly relevant to 
the construction of the statute. See, e.g., Morris, 1 

Carp. P.C. at 34 (declining to read the statute in 
such a way that “would go to repeal almost every 
patent that was ever granted”). 

Third, nearly contemporaneous English cases 
following shortly after the 1793 Act lend further insight 
into what processes were thought to be patentable 
under the English practice at the time the 
statute was enacted. Although the issue of the 
validity of process patents had not conclusively 
been settled in the English common law before 
1793, the question was brought before the courts in 
the landmark case of Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl. 463, 
465 (C.P.1795), which involved James Watt's patent 
for a “method of lessening the consumption of 
steam, and consequently fuel in [steam] engines.”

FN13 

In 1795, the court rendered a split decision, 
with two judges on each side. Boulton, 2 H. Bl. at 
463 (1795). Those who viewed process patents as 
invalid, as did Justice Buller, urged that a method 
was merely an unpatentable principle: “A patent 
must be for some new production from [elements of 
nature], and not for the elements themselves.” Id. at 

485. He thought “it impossible to support a patent 
for a method only, without having carried it into effect 
and produced some new substance.” Id. at 486. 
Justice Health similarly found that the “new invented 
method for lessening the consumption of steam 
and fuel in [steam] engines” (i.e., the Watt patent), 
being neither “machinery” nor a “substance [ ] 
(such as medicine[ ] ) formed by chemical and other 
processes,” was not within the Statute of Monopolies. 
Id. at 481-82. In contrast, Lord Chief Justice 
Eyres, who believed processes had long been a valid 
subject of patents, urged that “two-thirds, I believe 
I might say three-fourths, of all patents granted 
since the statute [of Monopolies] passed, are for 
methods of operating and of manufacturing.... ” Id. 
at 494-95 (emphasis added). He agreed that 
“[u]ndoubtedly there can be no patent for a mere 
principle; but for a principle so far embodied and 
connected with corporeal substances ... I think 
there may be a patent.” Id. at 495 (emphasis added). 
Justice Rooke also noted that Watt's method was 
within the statute because it was connected with

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

machinery: “What method can there be of saving 
steam or fuel in engines, but by some variation in 
the construction of them?” Id. at 478. The Justices 
who believed process patents were valid spoke in 
terms of manufacturing, machines, and compositions 
of matter, because the processes they believed 
fell within the statute were processes that 
“embodied and connected with corporeal substances.” 
Id. at 495. 

FN13. The Supreme Court has in several 
opinions noted Boulton v. Bull in connection 
with its consideration of English patent 
practice. See, e.g., Markman v. West-
view Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 381 

n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 
(1996); Evans v. Eaton, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 
356, 388 n. 2-3, 5 L.Ed. 472 (1822). 
In 1799, on appeal from another case involving 
the same Watt patent, the validity of such process 
patents were upheld. Hornblower v. Boulton 
(K.B.1799), 8 T.R. 95. There, Chief Justice Lord 
Kenyon stated that “it evidently appears that the 
patentee claims a monopoly for an engine or machine, 
composed of material parts, which are to 
produce the effect described; and that the mode of 
producing this is so described, as to enable mechanics 
to produce it.... I have no doubt in saying, that 
this is a patent for a manufacture, which I *972 understand 
to be something made by the hands of 
man.” Id. at 99. Justice Grose agreed, finding that 
“Mr. Watt had invented a method of lessening the 
consumption of steam and fuel in [steam] engines”, 
and this was “not a patent for a mere principle, but 
for the working and making of a new manufacture 
within the words and meaning of the statute.” Id. at 
101-02. He further noted, however, that “This 
method ... if not effected or accompanied by a manufacture, 
I should hardly consider as within the 
[statute].” Id. at 102-03 (emphasis added). Justice 
Lawrence similarly found such process patents to 
be permissible: “Engine and method mean the same 
thing, and may be the subject of a patent. ‘Method,’ 
properly speaking, is only placing several things 

and performing several operations in the most convenient 
order....” Id. at 106. 

There is no suggestion in any of this early consideration 
of process patents that processes for organizing 
human activity were or ever had been patentable. 
Rather, the uniform assumption was that 
the only processes that were patentable were processes 
for using or creating manufactures, machines, 
and compositions of matter. 

B 

The dissenters here, by implication at least, appear 
to assume that this consistent English practice 
should somehow be ignored in interpreting the cur


FN14

rent statute because of technological change.
There are several responses to this. 

FN14. See, e.g., Rader, J., dissenting op. at 
1011 (“[T]his court ties our patent system 
to dicta from an industrial age decades removed 
from the bleeding edge.”); id. 
(“[T]his court ... links patent eligibility to 
the age of iron and steel at a time of subatomic 
particles and terabytes....”); Newman, 
J., dissenting op. at 1011 (“[T]his 
court now adopts a redefinition of ‘process' 
in Section 101 that excludes forms of information-
based and software-implemented 
inventions arising from new technological 
capabilities....”). 

The first of these is that the Supreme Court has 
made clear that when Congress intends to codify 
existing law, as was the case with the 1793 statute, 
the law must be interpreted in light of the practice 
at the time of codification. In Schmuck v. United 
States, 489 U.S. 705, 718-19, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 
L.Ed.2d 734 (1989), for example, the Court considered 
the proper interpretation of Rule 31(c) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The rule, 
“which ha [d] not been amended since its adoption 
in 1944,” was a restatement of an 1872 Act 
“codif[ying] the common law for federal criminal 
trials.” Because of this fact, the Court found that 
the “prevailing practice at the time of the Rule's

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

promulgation informs our understanding of its 
terms.” Id.; see also, e.g., Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 

U.S. 186, 200 n. 5, 123 S.Ct. 769, 154 L.Ed.2d 683 
(2003) (considering the English practice at the time 
of the enactment of the 1790 copyright act); Tome 
v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 159-60, 166, 115 
S.Ct. 696, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995) (looking to practice 
and noting that “a majority of common-law 
courts were performing [a task required by the 
common law] for well over a century” in interpreting 
a Federal Rule of Evidence that “was intended 
to carry over the common-law”); Harper & Row 
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 
549-554, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) 
(relying on the history and practice of copyright 
fair-use when statutory provision reflected the 
“intent of Congress to codify the common-law doctrine”); 
Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 
161, 164-65, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939) 

(considering the English practice “which theretofore 
had been evolved in the English Court of 
Chancery” at the time of the 1789 Judiciary Act in 
*973 determining availability of costs under equity 
jurisdiction). 

Second, the Supreme Court language upon

FN15

which the dissents rely offers no warrant for 
rewriting the 1793 Act. To be sure, Congress intended 
the courts to have some latitude in interpreting 
§ 101 to cover emerging technologies, Chakrabarty, 
447 U.S. at 316, 100 S.Ct. 2204, and the categorical 
terms chosen are sufficiently broad to encompass 
a wide range of new technologies. But 
there is no evidence that Congress intended to confer 
upon the courts latitude to extend the categories 
of patentable subject matter in a significant way. To 
the contrary, the Supreme Court made clear that 
“Congress has performed its constitutional role in 
defining patentable subject matter in § 101; we perform 
ours in construing the language Congress has 
employed. In so doing, our obligation is to take 
statutes as we find them, guided, if ambiguity appears, 
by the legislative history and statutory purpose.” 
Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204. In Benson, the 
Court rejected the argument that its decision would 

“freeze process patents to old technologies, leaving 
no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing 
technology.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 
71, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972). Instead, 
the Court explained that it “may be that the patent 
laws should be extended to cover [such onrushing 
technology], a policy matter to which we are not 
competent to speak” but that “considered action by 
the Congress is needed.” Id. at 72-73, 93 S.Ct. 253. 

FN15. See, e.g., Newman, J., dissenting 
op. at 981 (“ ‘[C]ourts should not read into 
the patent laws limitations and conditions 
which the legislature has not expressed.’ ” 
(quoting Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 
1048)); Rader, J., dissenting op. at 1012 
(same). 

Third, we are not dealing here with a type of 
subject matter unknown in 1793. One commentator 
has noted: 

The absence of business method patents cannot 
be explained by an absence of entrepreneurial 
creativity in Great Britain during the century before 
the American Revolution. On the contrary, 
1720 is widely hailed as the beginning of a new 
era in English public finance and the beginning 
of major innovations in business organization.

ted). In the hundreds of patents in Woodcroft's 
exhaustive list of English patents granted 
from 1612 to 1793, there appears to be only a single 
patent akin to the type of method Bilski seeks to 
claim. That sole exception was a patent granted to 
John Knox in 1778 on a “Plan for assurances on 

FN17

lives of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.” 
Later commentators have viewed this single patent 
as clearly contrary to the Statute of Monopolies: 

FN16. Similarly, another commentator 
states: “it might be wondered why none of 
the many ingenious schemes of insurance

has ever been protected by patenting it.”

Such protection of an idea should be impossible.... 
It is difficult to understand how 
Knox's plan for insuring lives could be regarded 
as ‘a new manner of manufacture’; perhaps the 
Law Officer was in a very good humour that day, 
or perhaps he had forgotten the wording of the 
statute; most likely he was concerned only with 
the promised ‘very considerable Consumption of 
[Revenue] *974 Stamps' which, Knox declared, 
would ‘contribute to the increase of the Public 
Revenues.’ 
Renn, supra n. 16 at 285. There is no indication 
that Knox's patent was ever enforced or its validity 
tested, or that this example led to other patents 
or efforts to patent similar activities. But the existence 
of the Knox patent suggests that as of 
1793 the potential advantage of patenting such 
activities was well-understood. 

In short, the need to accommodate technological 
change in no way suggests that the judiciary is 
charged with rewriting the statute to include methods 
for organizing human activity that do not involve 
manufactures, machines, or compositions of 
matter. 

C 

Since the 1793 statute was reenacted in 1952, it 
is finally important also to inquire whether between 
1793 and 1952 the U.S. Patent Office and the courts 
in this country had departed from the English practice 
and allowed patents such as those sought by 
Bilski. In fact, the U.S. Patent Office operating under 
the 1793 Act hewed closely to the original understanding 
of the statute. As in the English practice 
of the time, there is no evidence that patents 

were granted under the 1793 Act on methods of organizing 
human activity not involving manufactures, 
machines or the creation of compositions of 
matter. The amicus briefs have addressed the early 
American practice, and some of them claim that human 
activity patents were allowed in the early period. 
To the contrary, the patents cited in the briefs 
are plainly distinguishable. 

The earliest claimed human activity patent 
cited in the briefs issued in 1840, entitled 
“Improvement in the Mathematical Operation of 
Drawing Lottery-Schemes.” Br. of Amicus Curiae 
Regulatory Datacorp 23 n.54. But that patent is fundamentally 
unlike the Bilski claim, since it does not 
claim a method of organizing human activity not 
involving manufactures, machines or the creation of 
compositions of matter. See U.S. Patent No. 1700 
(issued July 18, 1840). Rather, it is directed to a 
scheme of combining different combinations of 
numbers onto a large number of physical lottery 
tickets (i.e., a method for manufacturing lottery 
tickets). Id. col.1. The other early-issued patents 
cited in the amicus briefs are similarly distinguish


FN18

able.

FN18. See, e.g., Complemental Accident 
Insurance Policy, U.S. Patent No. 389,818 
(issued Sept. 18, 1888) (claiming a 
“complemental insurance policy” as an apparatus 
consisting of two separate cards secured 
together); Insurance System, U.S. 
Patent No. 853,852 (issued May 14, 1907) 

(claiming a “two-part insurance policy” as 
“an article of manufacture”). 

A number of the amici also refer to the 
discussion and the patents cited in “A 
USPTO White Paper” (the “White Paper”) 
to establish the historical foundation 
of business method patents. See, 
e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Accenture 
14-15 n. 11. As Judge Mayer notes, dissenting 
op. at 1001-02 n. 4, the White 
Paper does not show this proposition. As 
the White Paper itself recognizes, the

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

early financial patents it discusses were 
largely mechanical products and methods 
related to financial paper, not methods 
for organizing human activity. White 
Paper at 2. Thus, while the White Paper 
shows that inventions in the business 
realm of finance and management historically 
enjoyed patent protection, it does 
little to establish that business methods 
directed to the organization of human 
activity not involving manufactures, machines 
or the creation of compositions of 
matter were similarly patentable. 

Likewise, Supreme Court decisions before the 
1952 Patent Act assumed that the only processes 
that were patentable were those involving other 
types of patentable subject matter. In later cases the 
Supreme Court has recognized that these cases set 
forth the standard for process *975 patents in the 
pre-1952 period. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182-84, 101 
S.Ct. 1048; Gottschalk, 409 U.S. at 69-70, 93 S.Ct. 

253. The leading case is Corning v. Burden, 56 
U.S. 252, 15 How. 252, 14 L.Ed. 683 (1853). 
There, the Supreme Court discussed the patentability 
of processes: 
A process, eo nomine, is not made the subject 
of a patent in our act of Congress. It is included 
under the general term ‘useful art.’ An art may 
require one or more processes or machines in order 
to produce a certain result or manufacture. 

The term machine includes every mechanical 
device or combination of mechanical powers and 
devices to perform some function and produce a 
certain effect or result. But where the result or effect 
is produced by chemical action, by the operation 
or application of some element or power of 
nature, or of one substance to another, such 
modes, methods, or operations, are called 
‘processes.’ A new process is usually the result 
of discovery; a machine, of invention. The arts of 
tanning, dyeing, making water-proof cloth, vulcanizing 
India rubber, smelting ores, and numerous 
others are usually carried on by processes, as 

distinguished from machines.... It is for the discovery 
or invention of some practicable method 
or means of producing a beneficial result or effect 
that a patent is granted, and not for the result 
or effect itself. It is when the term process is used 
to represent the means or method of producing a 
result that it is patentable, and it will include all 
methods or means which are not effected by 
mechanism or mechanical combinations. 

Id. at 267-68 (emphases added). In Cochrane v. 

Deener, the Court clarified its understanding of a 

patentable “process”: 
That a process may be patentable, irrespective 
of the particular form of the instrumentalities 
used, cannot be disputed.... A process is a mode 
of treatment of certain materials to produce a 
given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed 
upon the subject-matter to be transformed 
and reduced to a different state or thing. If new 
and useful, it is just as patentable as is a piece of 
machinery. In the language of the patent law, it is 
an art. The machinery pointed out as suitable to 
perform the process may or may not be new or 
patentable; whilst the process itself may be altogether 
new, and produce an entirely new result. 
The process requires that certain things should 
be done with certain substances, and in a certain 
order; but the tools to be used in doing this may 
be of secondary consequence. 

94 U.S. 780, 787-88, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876) 

(emphases added). Finally, in Tilghman v. Proctor, 

102 U.S. 707, 722, 26 L.Ed. 279 (1880), the Court 

noted: 
That a patent can be granted for a process there 
can be no doubt. The patent law is not confined 
to new machines and new compositions of matter, 
but extends to any new and useful art or manufacture. 
A manufacturing process is clearly an 
art, within the meaning of the law. 

(Emphasis added). The Court's definition of a 

patentable process was well-accepted and consist


ently applied by the courts of appeals. See, e.g., 

P.E. Sharpless Co. v. Crawford Farms, 287 F. 655,

658-59 (2nd Cir.1923); Chicago Sugar-Refining 
Co. v. Charles Pope Glucose Co., 84 F. 977, 982 
(7th Cir.1898). 

Finally, nothing in the legislative history of the 
1952 Act suggests that Congress intended to enlarge 
the category of patentable subject matter to 
include patents such as the method Bilski attempts 
to claim. As discussed above, the only change made 
by the 1952 Act was in replacing the word *976 
“art” with the word “process.” The Supreme Court 
has already concluded that this change did not alter 
the substantive understanding of the statute. See 
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (“[A] process 
has historically enjoyed patent protection because 
it was considered a form of ‘art’ as that term 
was used in the 1793 Act.”). 

The House Report accompanying the 1952 bill 
includes the now-famous reference to “anything under 
the sun made by man”: 

A person may have “invented” a machine or a 
manufacture, which may include anything under 
the sun made by man, but it is not necessarily 
patentable under section 101 unless the conditions 
of the title are fulfilled. 

H.R.1923 at 7. Although this passage has been 
used by our court in past cases to justify a broad interpretation 
of patentable subject matter, I agree 
with Judge Mayer that, when read in context, the 
statement undercuts the notion that Congress intended 
to expand the scope of § 101. See Mayer, J., 
dissenting op. at 1000. It refers to things “made by 
man,” not to methods of organizing human activity. 
In this respect, the language is reminiscent of the 
1799 use of the phrase “something made by the 
hands of man” by Chief Justice Lord Kenyon as a 
limitation on patentable subject matter under the 
Statute of Monopolies. The idea that an invention 
must be “made by man” was used to distinguish “a 
philosophical principle only, neither organized or 
capable of being organized” from a patentable manufacture. 
Hornblower, 8 T.R. at 98. Lord Kenyon 
held that the patent before him was not based on a 

mere principle, but was rather “a patent for a manufacture, 
which I understand to be something made 
by the hands of man.” Id. at 98 (emphases added); 
accord American Fruit Growers v. Brogdex Co., 

283 U.S. 1, 11, 51 S.Ct. 328, 75 L.Ed. 801 (1931) 

(giving “anything made for use from raw or prepared 
materials” as one definition of 
“manufacture”). 

In short, the history of § 101 fully supports the 
majority's holding that Bilski's claim does not recite 
patentable subject matter. Our decision does not reflect 
“legislative” work, but rather careful and respectful 
adherence to the Congressional purpose. 

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

The court today acts en banc to impose a new 
and far-reaching restriction on the kinds of inventions 
that are eligible to participate in the patent 
system. The court achieves this result by redefining 
the word “process” in the patent statute, to exclude 
all processes that do not transform physical matter 
or that are not performed by machines. The court 
thus excludes many of the kinds of inventions that 
apply today's electronic and photonic technologies, 
as well as other processes that handle data and information 
in novel ways. Such processes have long 
been patent eligible, and contribute to the vigor and 
variety of today's Information Age. This exclusion 
of process inventions is contrary to statute, contrary 
to precedent, and a negation of the constitutional 
mandate. Its impact on the future, as well as on the 
thousands of patents already granted, is unknown. 

This exclusion is imposed at the threshold, before 
it is determined whether the excluded process 
is new, non-obvious, enabled, described, particularly 
claimed, etc.; that is, before the new process is 
examined for patentability. For example, we do not 
know whether the Bilski process would be found 
patentable under the statutory criteria, for they were 
never applied. 

The innovations of the “knowledge economy”-
of “digital prosperity”-have been dominant 
contributors to today's economic *977 growth and

societal change. Revision of the commercial structure 
affecting major aspects of today's industry 
should be approached with care, for there has been 
significant reliance on the law as it has existed, as 
many amici curiae pointed out. Indeed, the full 
reach of today's change of law is not clear, and the 
majority opinion states that many existing situations 
may require reassessment under the new criteria. 


Uncertainty is the enemy of innovation. These 
new uncertainties not only diminish the incentives 
available to new enterprise, but disrupt the settled 
expectations of those who relied on the law as it existed. 
I respectfully dissent. 

DISCUSSION 

The court's exclusion of specified process inventions 
from access to the patent system is 
achieved by redefining the word “process” in the 
patent statute. However, the court's redefinition is 
contrary to statute and to explicit rulings of the Supreme 
Court and this court. I start with the statute: 

Section 101 is the statement of statutory eligibility 

From the first United States patent act in 1790, 
the subject matter of the “useful arts” has been 
stated broadly, lest advance restraints inhibit the 
unknown future. The nature of patent-eligible subject 
matter has received judicial attention over the 
years, as new issues arose with advances in science 
and technology. The Supreme Court has consistently 
confirmed the constitutional and legislative 
purpose of providing a broadly applicable incentive 
to commerce and creativity, through this system of 
limited exclusivity. Concurrently, the Court early 
explained the limits of patentable subject matter, in 
that “fundamental truths” were not intended to be 
included in a system of exclusive rights, for they 
are the general foundations of knowledge. Thus 
laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract 
ideas are not subject to patenting. Several rulings of 
the Court have reviewed patent eligibility in light of 
these fundamentals. However, the Court explicitly 
negated today's restrictions. My colleagues in the 
majority are mistaken in finding that decisions of 

the Court require the per se limits to patent eligibility 
that the Federal Circuit today imposes. The patent 
statute and the Court's decisions neither establish 
nor support the exclusionary criteria now adopted. 


The court today holds that any process that 
does not transform physical matter or require performance 
by machine is not within the definition of 
“process” in any of the patent statutes since 1790. 
All of the statutes contained a broad definition of 
patent-eligible subject matter, like that in the current 
Patent Act of 1952: 

35 U.S.C § 101 Whoever invents or discovers 
any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, 
or composition of matter, or any new and 
useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent 
therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements 
of this title. 

In Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 101 S.Ct. 
1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981) the Court explained 
that Section 101 is not an independent condition of 
patentability, but a general statement of subject 
matter eligibility. The Court stated: 

Section 101, however, is a general statement of 
the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent 
protection “subject to the conditions and requirements 
of this title.” Specific conditions for 
patentability follow and § 102 covers in detail the 
conditions relating to novelty. The question 
therefore of whether a particular invention is novel 
is “wholly apart *978 from whether the invention 
falls in a category of statutory subject matter.”

(quoting In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952, 961

“Process” is defined in the 1952 statute as follows: 


35 U.S.C. § 100(b) The term “process” means 
process, art or method, and includes a new use of

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

a known process, machine, manufacture, composition 
of matter, or material. 

The 1952 Patent Act replaced the word “art” in 
prior statutes with the word “process,” while the 
rest of Section 101 was unchanged from earlier 
statutes. The legislative history for the 1952 Act explained 
that “art” had been “interpreted by courts to 
be practically synonymous with process or method.” 
S.Rep. No. 82-1979 (1952), reprinted in 1952 

U.S.C.C.A.N. 2394, 2398, 2409-10. In Diehr the 
Court explained that a process “has historically enjoyed 
patent protection because it was considered a 
form of ‘art’ as that term was used in the 1793 
Act.” 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 
The definition of “process” provided at 35 

U.S.C. § 100(b) is not “unhelpful,” as this court 
now states, maj. op. at 951 n. 3, but rather points up 
the errors in the court's new statutory interpretation. 
Section 100(b) incorporates the prior usage “art” 
and the term “method,” and places no restriction on 
the definition. This court's redefinition of “process” 
as limiting access to the patent system to those processes 
that use specific machinery or that transform 
matter, is contrary to two centuries of statutory 
definition. 
The breadth of Section 101 and its predecessor 
provisions reflects the legislative intention to accommodate 
not only known fields of creativity, but 
also the unknown future. The Court has consistently 
refrained from imposing unwarranted restrictions 
on statutory eligibility, and for computer-
implemented processes the Court has explicitly rejected 
the direction now taken. Nonetheless, this 
court now adopts a redefinition of “process” in Section 
101 that excludes forms of information-based 
and software-implemented inventions arising from 
new technological capabilities, stating that this result 
is required by the Court's computer-related 
cases, starting with Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 
63, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972). However, 
the Court in Benson rejected the restriction that is 
imposed today: 

This court's new definition of “process” was rejected 
in Gottschalk v. Benson 

In Benson the claimed invention was a mathematical 
process for converting binary-coded 
decimal numerals into pure binary numbers. The 
Court explained that a mathematical formula unlimited 
to a specific use was simply an abstract idea of 
the nature of “fundamental truths,” “phenomena of 
nature,” and “abstract intellectual concepts,” as 
have traditionally been outside of patent systems. 
409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253. However, the Court 
explicitly declined to limit patent-eligible processes 
in the manner now adopted by this court, stating: 

It is argued that a process patent must either be 
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must 
operate to change articles or materials to a 
“different state or thing.” We do not hold that no 
process patent could ever qualify if it did not 
meet the requirements of our prior precedents. It 
is said that the decision precludes a patent for any 
program servicing a computer. We do not so 
hold. 

Id. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. The Court explained 
that “the requirements of our prior precedents” did 
not preclude patents on computer programs, despite 
the statement *979 drawn from Cochrane v. Deener, 
94 U.S. 780, 787-88, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876), that 
“[t]ransformation and reduction of an article ‘to a 
different state or thing’ is the clue to the patentability 
of a process claim that does not include particular 
machines.” Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 

253. Although this same statement is now relied 
upon by this court as requiring its present ruling, 
maj. op at 956 & n. 11, the Court in Benson was explicit 
that: “We do not hold that no process patent 
could ever qualify if it did not meet [the Court's] 
prior precedents.” The Court recognized that Cochrane's 
statement was made in the context of a 
mechanical process and a past era, and protested: 
It is said we freeze process patents to old technologies, 
leaving no room for the revelations of the 
new, onrushing technology. Such is not our purpose.

Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. Instead, 
the Court made clear that it was not barring patents 
on computer programs, and rejected the 
“argu[ment] that a process patent must either be 
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must 
operate to change articles or materials to a 
‘different state or thing’ ” in order to satisfy Section 

101. Id. Although my colleagues now describe 
these statements as “equivocal,” maj. op. at 956, 
there is nothing equivocal about “We do not so 
hold.” Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. Nonetheless, 
this court now so holds. 
In Parker v. Flook the Court again rejected 
today's restrictions 

The eligibility of mathematical processes next 
reached the Court in Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 
98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978), where the 
Court held that the “process” category of Section 
101 was not met by a claim to a mathematical formula 
for calculation of alarm limits for use in connection 
with catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons 
and, as in Benson, the claim was essentially for the 
mathematical formula. The Court later summarized 
its Flook holding, stating in Diamond v. Diehr that: 

The [Flook] application, however, did not purport 
to explain how these other variables were to be 
determined, nor did it purport “to contain any disclosure 
relating to the chemical processes at 
work, the monitoring of the process variables, nor 
the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an 
alarm system. All that it provides is a formula for 
computing an updated alarm limit.” 

Diehr, 450 U.S. at 186-87, 101 S.Ct. 1048 
(quoting Flook, 437 U.S. at 586, 98 S.Ct. 2522). 

The Court explained in Flook that a fieldof-
use restriction to catalytic conversion did not 
distinguish Flook's mathematical process from that 
in Benson. However, the Court reiterated that patent 
eligibility of computer-directed processes is not 
controlled by the “qualifications of our earlier precedents,” 
again negating any limiting effect of the 
usages of the past, on which this court now places 

heavy reliance. The Court stated: 

The statutory definition of “process” is broad. An 
argument can be made, however, that this Court 
has only recognized a process as within the statutory 
definition when it either was tied to a particular 
apparatus or operated to change materials 
to a “different state or thing.” As in Benson, we 
assume that a valid process patent may issue even 
if it does not meet one of these qualifications of 

FN1

our earlier precedents.[] 

FN1. My colleagues cite only part of this 
quotation as the Court's holding in Flook, 
maj. op. at 955, ignoring the qualifying 
words “[a]n argument can be made” as 
well as the next sentence clarifying that 
this argument was rejected by the Court in 
Benson and is now again rejected in Flook. 

*980 Flook, 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522 
(quoting Cochrane, 94 U.S. at 787). This statement 
directly contravenes this court's new requirement 
that all processes must meet the court's 
“machine-or-transformation test” or be barred from 
access to the patent system. 

The Court in Flook discussed that abstractions 
and fundamental principles have never been subject 
to patenting, but recognized the “unclear line” 
between an abstract principle and the application of 
such principle: 

The line between a patentable “process” and an 
unpatentable “principle” is not always clear. Both 
are “conception[s] of the mind, seen only by 
[their] effects when being executed or performed.”

Products, 17 Rutgers Computer & Tech. L.J. 87 
(1991); D. Chisum, The Patentability of Algorithms, 
47 U. Pitt. L.Rev. 959 (1986)). That 
Flook does not support today's per se exclusion of 
forms of process inventions from access to the patent 
system is reinforced in the next Section 101 
case decided by the Court: 

In Diamond v. Chakrabarty the Court again rejected 
per se exclusions of subject matter from Section 
101 

In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 100 
S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980), the scope of 
Section 101 was challenged as applied to the new 
fields of biotechnology and genetic engineering, 
with respect to the patent eligibility of a new bacterial 
“life form.” The Court explained the reason 
for the broad terms of Section 101: 

The subject-matter provisions of the patent law 
have been cast in broad terms to fulfill the constitutional 
and statutory goal of promoting “the Progress 
of Science and the useful Arts” with all that 
means for the social and economic benefits envisioned 
by Jefferson. Broad general language is 
not necessarily ambiguous when congressional 
objectives require broad terms. 

Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (quoting U.S. Const., 
art. I, § 8). The Court referred to the use of “any” in 
Section 101 (“Whoever invents or discovers any 
new and useful process ... or any new and useful 
improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, 
subject to the conditions and requirements of this 
title”), and reiterated that the statutory language 
shows that Congress “plainly contemplated that the 
patent laws would be given wide scope.” Id. at 308, 
100 S.Ct. 2204. The Court referred to the legislative 
intent to include within the scope of Section 
101 “anything under the sun that is made by man,” 
id. at 309, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citing S. Rep. 82-1979, 

at 5, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, pp. 
2394, 2399; H.R. Rep. 82-1923, at 6 (1952)), and 
stated that the unforeseeable future should not be 
inhibited by judicial restriction of the “broad general 
language” of Section 101: 

A rule that unanticipated inventions are without 

protection would conflict with the core concept 

of the patent law that anticipation undermines 

patentability. Mr. Justice Douglas reminded that 

the *981 inventions most benefiting mankind are 

those that push back the frontiers of chemistry, 

physics, and the like. Congress employed broad 

general language in drafting § 101 precisely be


cause such inventions are often unforeseeable. 

Id. at 315-16, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted). The Court emphasized 
that its precedents did not alter this understanding 
of Section 101's breadth, stating that “ 
Flook did not announce a new principle that inventions 
in areas not contemplated by Congress when 
the patent laws were enacted are unpatentable per 
se.” Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204. 

Whether the applications of physics and chemistry 
that are manifested in advances in computer 
hardware and software were more or less foreseeable 
than the advances in biology and biotechnology 
is debatable, but it is not debatable that these 
fields of endeavor have become primary contributors 
to today's economy and culture, as well as offering 
an untold potential for future advances. My colleagues 
offer no reason now to adopt a policy of exclusion 
of the unknown future from the subject 
matter now embraced in Section 101. 

Soon after Chakrabarty was decided, the Court 
returned to patentability issues arising from computer 
capabilities: 

In Diamond v. Diehr the Court directly held that 
computer-implemented processes are included in 

Section 101 

The invention presented to the Court in Diehr 
was a “physical and chemical process for molding 
precision synthetic rubber products” where the pro

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

cess steps included using a mathematical formula. 
The Court held that the invention fit the “process” 
category of Section 101 although mathematical calculations 
were involved, and repeated its observation 
in Chakrabarty that “courts should not read into 
the patent laws limitations and conditions which 
the legislature has not expressed.” Diehr, 450 U.S. 
at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (citing Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 308, 100 
S.Ct. 2204). 

The Court distinguished a claim that would 
cover all uses of a mathematical formula and thus is 
an abstract construct, as in Benson, from a claim 
that applies a mathematical calculation for a specified 
purpose, as in Diehr. The Court stated that “a 
claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory 
does not become nonstatutory simply because it 
uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or 
digital computer,” id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048, and 
explained that the line between statutory and non-
statutory processes depends on whether the process 
is directed to a specific purpose, see id. (“It is now 
commonplace that an application of a law of nature 
or mathematical formula to a known structure or 
process may well be deserving of patent protection.” 
(emphasis in original)). The Court clarified 
that Flook did not hold that claims may be dissected 
into old and new parts to assess their patent eligibility. 
Id. at 189 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 

However, the Court did not propose the 
“machine-or-transformation” test that this court 
now insists was “enunciated” in Diehr as a specific 
limit to Section 101. Maj. op. at 953-54. In Diehr 
there was no issue of machine or transformation, 
for the Diehr process both employed a machine and 
produced a chemical transformation: the process 
was conducted in “an openable rubber molding 
press,” and it cured the rubber. In discussing the 
known mathematical formula used by Diehr to calculate 
the relation between temperature and the rate 
of a chemical reaction, the Court recited the traditional 
exceptions of “laws of nature, natural phenomena, 
and abstract ideas,” 450 U.S. at 185, 101 

S.Ct. 1048, and explained that the entirety of the 
process *982 must be considered, not an individual 
mathematical step. 

The Court characterized the holdings in Benson 
and Flook as standing for no more than the continued 
relevance of these “long-established” judicial 
exclusions, id., and repeated that a practical application 
of pure science or mathematics may be patentable, 
citing Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v. 
Radio Corp. of America, 306 U.S. 86, 94, 59 S.Ct. 
427, 83 L.Ed. 506 (1939) ( “While a scientific 
truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not a 
patentable invention, a novel and useful structure 
created with the aid of knowledge and scientific 
truth may be.”). The Court explained that the presence 
of a mathematical formula does not preclude 
patentability when the structure or process is performing 
a function within the scope of the patent 
system, stating: 

[W]hen a claim containing a mathematical formula 
implements or applies that formula in a 
structure or process which, when considered as a 
whole, is performing a function which the patent 
laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming 
or reducing an article to a different state or 
thing), then the claim satisfies the requirements 
of § 101. 

450 U.S. at 192, 101 S.Ct. 1048. This statement's 
parenthetical “e.g.” is relied on by the majority 
for its statement that Diehr requires today's 
“machine-or-transformation” test. However, this “ 

e.g. ” does not purport to state the only “function 
which the patent laws were designed to protect.” Id. 
This “ e.g. ” indeed describes the process in Diehr, 
but it does not exclude all other processes from access 
to patenting. 
It cannot be inferred that the Court intended, by 
this “e.g.” parenthetical, to require the far-reaching 
exclusions now attributed to it. To the contrary, the 
Court in Diehr was explicit that “an application of 
a law of nature or mathematical formula” may merit 
patent protection, 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

(emphasis in original), and that the claimed process 
must be considered as a whole, id. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 
1048. The Court recognized that a process claim 
may combine steps that were separately known, and 
that abstract ideas such as mathematical formulae 
may be combined with other steps to produce a patentable 
process. Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048. The 
steps are not to be “dissect[ed]” into new and old 
steps; it is the entire process that frames the Section 
101 inquiry. Id. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048. 

The Diehr Court did not hold, as the majority 
opinion states, that transformation of physical state 
is a requirement of eligibility set by Section 101 
unless the process is performed by a machine. It 
cannot be inferred that the Court silently imposed 
such a rule. See maj. op. at 956 (relying on lack of 
repetition in Diehr of the Benson and Flook disclaimers 
of requiring machine or transformation, as 
an implicit rejection of these disclaimers and tacit 
adoption of the requirement). There was no issue in 
Diehr of the need for either machine or transformation, 
for both were undisputedly present in the process 
of curing rubber. It cannot be said that the 
Court “enunciated” today's “definitive test” in 

FN2

Diehr.

the Supreme Court did not adopt the test

*983 Subsequent Supreme Court authority reinforced 
the breadth of Section 101 

In J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred 

International, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 122 S.Ct. 593, 
151 L.Ed.2d 508 (2001), the Court described Section 
101 as a “dynamic provision designed to encompass 
new and unforeseen inventions,” id. at 
135, 122 S.Ct. 593, that case arising in the context 
of eligibility of newly developed plant varieties for 
patenting. The Court stated: “As in Chakrabarty, 
we decline to narrow the reach of § 101 where Congress 
has given us no indication that it intends this 
result.” Id. at 145-46, 122 S.Ct. 593. The Court reiterated 
that “Congress plainly contemplated that the 
patent laws would be given wide scope,” id. at 130, 
122 S.Ct. 593 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 
308, 100 S.Ct. 2204), and that the language of Section 
101 is “extremely broad,” id. This is not language 
of restriction, and it reflects the statutory 
policy and purpose of inclusion, not exclusion, in 
Section 101. 

The Court's decisions of an earlier age do not support 
this court's restrictions of Section 101 

My colleagues also find support for their restrictions 
on patent-eligible “process” inventions in 
the pre-Section 101 decisions O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 

U.S. (15 How.) 62, 14 L.Ed. 601 (1853), Cochrane 
v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876), and 
Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707, 26 L.Ed. 279 
(1880). Although the Court in Benson and in Flook 
took care to state that these early decisions do not 
require the restrictions that the Court was rejecting, 
this court now places heavy reliance on these early 
decisions, which this court describes as “consistent 
with the machine-or-transformation test later articulated 
in Benson and reaffirmed in Diehr.” Maj. op. 
at 955. As I have discussed, no such test was 
“articulated in Benson ” and “reaffirmed in Diehr.” 
However, these early cases do show, contrary 
to the majority opinion, that a “process” has always 
been a distinct category of patentable invention, 
and not tied to either apparatus or transformation, 
as this court now holds. For example, in Tilghman 

v. Proctor the Court considered a patent on a process 
for separating fats and oils, and held that the 
process was not restricted to any particular apparat©

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

us. The Court held that a process is an independent 
category of invention, and stated: 

That a patent can be granted for a process, there 
can be no doubt. The patent law is not confined 
to new machines and new compositions of matter, 
but extends to any new and useful art or manufacture. 


102 U.S. at 722; see also Corning v. Burden, 
56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 268, 14 L.Ed. 683 (1853) 
(“It is for the discovery or invention of some practical 
method or means of producing a beneficial 
result or effect, that a patent is granted, and not for 
the result or effect itself.”) The difference between 
a process and the other categories of patent-eligible 
subject matter does not deprive process inventions 
of the independent status accorded by statute, by 
precedent, and by logic, all of which negate the 
court's new rule that a process must be tied to a particular 
machine or must transform physical matter. 

The majority also relies on O'Reilly v. Morse, 
citing the Court's rejection of Morse's Claim 8 for 
“the use of the motive power of the electro or galvanic 
current, which I call electromagnetism, 
however developed, for making or printing intelligible 
characters, signs or letters at any distances....” 
The Court explained: 

In fine he claims an exclusive right to use a manner 
and process which he has not described and 
indeed had not invented, and therefore could not 
describe when he obtained his patent. The Court 
*984 is of the opinion that the claim is too broad, 
and not warranted by law. 

56 U.S. (15 How.) at 113. However, the claims 
that were directed to the communication system 
that was described by Morse were held patentable, 
although no machine, transformation, or manufacture 
was required. See Morse's Claim 5 (“The system 
of signs, consisting of dots and spaces, and horizontal 
lines, for numerals, letters, words, or sentences, 
substantially as herein set forth and illustrated, 
for telegraphic purposes.”). I cannot discern 

how the Court's rejection of Morse's Claim 8 on 
what would now be Section 112 grounds, or the allowance 
of his other claims, supports this court's 
ruling today. Indeed, Morse's claim 5, to a system 
of signs, is no more “tangible” than the systems 
held patentable in Alappat and State Street Bank, 
discussed post and now cast into doubt, or the Bil-
ski system here held ineligible for access to patenting. 


The majority opinion also relies on Cochrane 

v. Deener, particularly on certain words quoted in 
subsequent opinions of the Court. In Cochrane the 
invention was a method for bolting flour, described 
as a series of mechanical steps in the processing of 
flour meal. The question before the Court was 
whether the patented process would be infringed if 
the same steps were performed using different machinery. 
The answer was “that a process may be 
patentable, irrespective of the particular form of the 
instrumentalities used.” 94 U.S. at 788. The Court 
stressed the independence of a process from the 
tools that perform it: 
A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials 
to produce a given result. It is an act, or 
series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter 
to be transformed and reduced to a different state 
or thing. If new and useful, it is just as patentable 
as is a piece of machinery. In the language of the 
patent law, it is an art. The machinery pointed out 
as suitable to perform the process may or may not 
be new or patentable; whilst the process itself 
may be altogether new, and produce an entirely 
new result. The process requires that certain 
things should be done with certain substances, 
and in a certain order; but the tools to be used in 
doing this may be of secondary consequence. 

94 U.S. at 788. The Court did not restrict the 
kinds of patentable processes; the issue in Cochrane 
was whether the process must be tied to the 
machinery that the patentee used to perform it. 

This court now cites Cochrane's description of 
a process as “acts performed upon subject-matter to

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

be transformed and reduced to a different state or 
thing,” id., this court stating that unless there is 
transformation there is no patentable process. That 
is not what this passage means. In earlier opinions 
this court and its predecessor court stated the correct 
view of this passage, as has the Supreme Court. 
The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals observed: 


[This Cochrane passage] has sometimes been 
misconstrued as a ‘rule’ or ‘definition’ requiring 
that all processes, to be patentable, must operate 
physically on substances. Such a result misapprehends 
the nature of the passage quoted as dictum, 
in its context, and the question being discussed 
by the author of the opinion. To deduce such a 
rule from the statement would be contrary to its 
intendment which was not to limit process patentability 
but to point out that a process is not 
limited to the means used in performing it. 

In re Prater, 56 C.C.P.A. 1381, 415 F.2d 1393, 
1403 (1969). Again in In re Schrader, 22 F.3d 290, 
295 n. 12 (Fed.Cir.1994) this court noted that Cochrane 
did not limit patent eligible subject matter to 
*985 physical transformation, and that transformation 
of “intangibles” could qualify for patenting. In 

AT & T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 
F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed.Cir.1999), this court described 
physical transformation as “merely one example 
of how a mathematical algorithm may bring 
about a useful application.” 

The Court saw the Cochrane decision in its 
proper perspective. Both Flook and Benson rejected 
the idea that Cochrane imposed the requirement of 
either specific machinery or the transformation of 
matter, as discussed ante. See Flook, 437 U.S. at 
588 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522; Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 
S.Ct. 253. Non-transformative processes were not 
at issue in either Cochrane or Diehr, and there is no 
endorsement in Diehr of a 
“machine-or-transformation” requirement for patentable 
processes. 

These early cases cannot be held now to re


quire exclusion, from the Section 101 definition of 
“process,” of all processes that deal with data and 
information, whose only machinery is electrons, 
photons, or waves, or whose product is not a transformed 
physical substance. 

The English Statute of Monopolies and English 
common law do not limit “process” in Section 101 

I comment on this aspect in view of the proposal 
in the concurring opinion that this court's new 
two-prong test for Section 101 process inventions 
was implicit in United States law starting with the 
Act of 1790, because of Congress's knowledge of 
and importation of English common law and the 
English Statute of Monopolies of 1623. The full 
history of patent law in England is too ambitious to 
be achieved within the confines of Bilski's appeal,

and the concurring opinion's selective treatment 
of this history may propagate misunderstanding.

The concurrence places primary reliance on the 
Statute of Monopolies, which was enacted in response 
to the monarchy's grant of monopolies “to 
court favorites in goods or businesses which had 
long before been enjoyed by the public.” Graham v. 
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 5, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 
L.Ed.2d 545 (1966) (citing Peter Meinhardt, Inventions, 
Patents and Monopoly 30-35 (1946)). The 
Statute of Monopolies outlawed these “odious 
monopolies” or favors of the Crown, but, contrary 
to the concurring opinion, the Statute had nothing 
whatever to do with narrowing or eliminating categories 
of inventive subject matter eligible for a 
British patent. See Prager, Historical Background 
and Foundation of American Patent Law, 5 Am. J. 
Legal Hist. at 313 (“The statute [of Monopolies] 
said nothing about meritorious *986 functions of 
patents, nothing about patent disclosures, and nothing 
about patent procedures; it was only directed 
against patent abuses.”). 

Patents for inventions had been granted by the 
Crown long before 1623. See Hulme, The History 
of the Patent System Under the Prerogative and at 
Common Law, 12 L.Q. Rev. at 143 (the first patent 
grant to the “introducer of a newly-invented process” 
was in 1440); Klitzke, Historical Background 
of the English Patent Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 626-27 
(discussing first patents for “invention” in England 
in the fifteenth century). That practice was unaffected 
by the terms of the Statute of Monopolies, 
which rendered “utterly void” all “Monopolies and 
all Commissions, Grants, Licenses, Charters and 

Letters Patent” that were directed to “the sole Buying, 
Selling, Making, Working or Using any Thing 
within this Realm,” 21 Jac. 1, c.3, § I (Eng.), but 
which specifically excepted Letters Patent for inventions 
from that exclusion, id. § VI. The only 
new limitation on patents for invention was a four-
teen-year limit on the term of exclusivity. See 
Klitzke, Historical Background of the English Patent 
Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 649. 

The usage “Letters Patent” described one of the 
forms of document whereby the Crown granted 
various rights, whether the grant was for an odious 
monopoly that the Statute of Monopolies eliminated, 
or for rights to an invention new to England. 
That usage was not changed by the Statute of 
Monopolies. Nor were other aspects of the British 
practice which differed from that enacted in the 
United States, particularly the aspect whereby a 
British patent could be granted to a person who imported 
something that was new to England, whether 
or not the import was previously known or the importer 
was the inventor thereof. In England, “[t]he 
rights of the inventor are derived from those of the 
importer, and not vice versa as is commonly supposed.” 
Hulme, The History of the Patent System 
Under the Prerogative and at Common Law, 12 

L.Q.R. at 152; see also MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial 
Revolution 13 (“The rights of the first inventor 
were understood to derive from those of the 
first importer of the invention.”). 
In contrast, in the United States the patent right 
has never been predicated upon importation, and 
has never been limited to “manufactures.” See, e.g., 
Walterscheid, To Promote the Progress of Useful 
Arts 93, 137-38, 224; see also Prager, Historic 
Background and Foundation of American Patent 
Law, 5 Am. J. Legal Hist. at 309 (“The American 
Revolution destroyed many of the ancient customs; 
it brought a sweeping reorientation of patent law, 
with new forms, new rules, new concepts, and new 
ideals.”). The differences between the American 
and English patent law at this nation's founding 
were marked, and English judicial decisions inter

preting the English statute are of limited use in interpreting 
the United States statute. In all events, no 
English decision supports this court's new restrictive 
definition of “process.” 

The concurrence proposes that the Statute of 
Monopolies provides a binding definition of the 
terms “manufacture,” “machine,” “composition of 
matter,” and “process” in Section 101 of the U.S. 
Patent Act. See concurring op. at 968-70. The only 
one of these terms that appears in the Statute of 
Monopolies is “manufacture”, a broad term that reflects 
the usage of the period. Even at the time of 
this country's founding, the usage was broad, as set 
forth in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English 
Language (3d. ed. 1768), which defines 
“manufacture” as “any thing made by art,” and 
defines *987 “art” as “the power of doing 
something not taught by nature and instinct”; “a 
science”; “a trade”; “artfulness”; “skill”; 
“dexterity.” Historians explain that England's 
primary motive for patenting was to promote 
“[a]cquisition of superior Continental technology” 
at a time when England lagged behind, see 
MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial Revolution 11; 
this cannot be interpreted to mean that England and 
perforce the United States intended to eliminate 
“processes” from this incentive system. It is inconceivable 
that on this background the Framers, and 
again the enactors of the first United States patent 
statutes in 1790 and 1793, intended sub silentio to 
impose the limitations on “process” now created by 
this court. 

Congress' earliest known draft patent bill included 
the terms “art, manufacture, engine, machine, 
invention or device, or any improvement 
upon the same.” Walterscheid, To Promote the Progress 
of Useful Arts 92. The 1793 Act explicitly 
stated “any new and useful art,” § 1, 1 Stat. 318 
(1793), a usage that was carried forward until “art” 
was replaced with “process” in 35 U.S.C. § 101 and 
defined in § 100(b). Historians discuss that Congress' 
inclusion of any “art” or “process” in the patent 
system was a deliberate clarification of the Eng


lish practice. See Walterscheid, To Promote the 
Progress of Useful Arts 93 (“[The first patent bill] 
appears to be an obvious attempt to deal legislatively 
with issues that were beginning to be addressed 
by the English courts.... [I]t states unequivocally 
that improvement inventions are patentable 
and expands the definition of invention or discovery 
beyond simply ‘manufacture.’ ”); Karl B. Lutz, 

Patents and Science: A Clarification of the Patent 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution, 32 J.P.O.S. 83, 86 
(1950) ( “By the year 1787 it was being recognized 
even in Great Britain that the phrase ‘new manufactures' 
was an unduly limited object for a patent system, 
since it seems to exclude new processes.... 
[This question was] resolved in the United States 
Constitution by broadening the field from ‘new 
manufactures' to ‘useful arts'....”). 

In interpreting a statute, it is the language selected 
by Congress that occupies center stage: 
“[O]ur obligation is to take statutes as we find 
them, guided, if ambiguity appears, by the legislative 
history and statutory purpose.” Chakrabarty, 
447 U.S. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204. The Court has 
“perceive[d] no ambiguity” in Section 101, leaving 
no need for foreign assistance. Id. The legislative 
choice to afford the patent system “wide scope,” id. 
at 308, 100 S.Ct. 2204, including “process” inventions, 
evolved in the United States independent of 
later developments of the common law in England. 

The concurrence concludes that the Statute of 
Monopolies foreclosed the future patenting of anything 
that the concurrence calls a “business method”-
the term is not defined-whether or not the 
method is new, inventive, and useful. But the Statute 
of Monopolies only foreclosed “odious” monopolies, 
illustrated by historical reports that Queen 
Elizabeth had granted monopolies on salt, ale, saltpeter, 
white soap, dredging machines, playing 
cards, and rape seed oil, and on processes and services 
such as Spanish leather-making, mining of 
various metals and ores, dying and dressing cloth, 
and iron tempering. See Walterscheid, Early Evolution

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

Historical Background of the English Patent Law, 

41 J.P.O.S. at 634-35. These and other grants, many 
of which were implemented by Letters Patent, were 
the “odious monopolies” that were rendered illegal. 
They included several classes of known activity, 
product and process, and had nothing to do with 
new “inventions.” *988 The Statute of Monopolies 
cannot be held to have restricted the kinds of new 
processes that can today be eligible for patenting in 
the United States, merely because it outlawed patents 
on non-novel businesses in England. The presence 
or absence of “organizing human activity,” a 
vague term created by the concurrence, has no connection 
or relevance to Parliament's elimination of 
monopoly patronage grants for old, established arts. 
The Statute of Monopolies neither excluded nor included 
inventions that involve human activity, although 
the words “the sole working or making in 
any manner of new manufactures” presuppose human 
activity. 21 Jac. 1, c.3, § VI (emphases added). 
We are directed to no authority for the proposition 
that a new and inventive process involving “human 
activity” has historically been treated differently 
from other processes; indeed, most inventions involve 
human activity. 

The concurrence has provided hints of the complexity 
of the evolution of patent law in England, as 
in the United States, as the Industrial Revolution 
took hold. Historians have recognized these complexities. 
See, e.g., Walterscheid, To Promote the 
Progress of Useful Arts 5 (“[T]he American patent 
law almost from its inception departed from its 
common law counterpart in the interpretation that 
would be given to the definition of novelty....”); 
Klitzke, Historical Background of the English Patent 
Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 638 (noting that in Elizabethan 
times, novelty only required a showing that 
“the industry had not been carried on within the 
realm within a reasonable period of time”, while 
today “the proof of a single public sale of an article” 
or a “printed publication” can negate patentability). 


I caution against over-simplification, particu


larly in view of the uncertainties in English common 
law at the time of this country's founding. See 
Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl. 463, 491 (C.P.1795) (Eyre, 
C.J.) (“Patent rights are no where that I can find accurately 
discussed in our books.”); MacLeod, Inventing 
the Industrial Revolution 61 (“It was only 
from the time when the Privy Council relinquished 
jurisdiction that a case law on patents began to develop.... 
But it was a slow process and even the 
spate of hard-fought patent cases at the end of the 
eighteenth century did little to establish a solid core 
of judicial wisdom.”). The English judicial opinions 
of the eighteenth century were not as limiting on 
the United States as my colleagues suggest. See 
Walterscheid, The Nature of the Intellectual Property 
Clause: A Study in Historical Perspective 355 
(2002) (“In the eighteenth century, patentees and 
those who gave advice concerning patents were certainly 
of the view that the Statute did not preclude 
the patenting of general principles of operation.”); 
see also MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial Revolution 
63-64. 

It is reported that in the century and a half following 
enactment of the Statute of Monopolies, the 
English patent registers were replete with inventions 
claimed as “processes.” See Walterscheid, 
Early Evolution (Part 3), 77 J.P.T.O.S. at 856 (“As 
one of the earliest texts on the patent law stated in 
1806: “most of the patents now taken out, are by 
name, for the method of doing particular 
things....”). The concurrence agrees; but it is also 
reported that because patents were not litigated in 
the common law courts until the Privy Council authorized 
such suits in 1752, judicial interpretation 
of various aspects of patent law were essentially absent 
until about the time this country achieved independence, 
leading to the variety of views expressed 
in Boulton v. Bull. The legislators in the new 
United States cannot now be assigned the straight-
jacket of law not yet developed in England. Indeed, 
the *989 first patent granted by President Washington, 
upon examination by Secretary of State Jefferson, 
was for a method of “making Pot-ash and 
Pearl-ash,” a process patent granted during the peri

od that the concurrence states was fraught with 
English uncertainty about process patents. See The 
First United States Patent, 36 J.P.O.S. 615, 616-17 
(1954). 

The concurrence lists some English process 
patents predating the United States' 1793 Patent 
Act, and argues that processes not sufficiently 
“like” these archaic inventions should not now be 
eligible for patenting. I refer simply to Flook, 437 

U.S. at 588 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522, where the Court 
stated: “As in Benson, we assume that a valid process 
patent may issue even if it does not meet one 
of the qualifications of our earlier precedents.” 
Similarly, the Chakrabarty Court stated: “[A] statute 
is not to be confined to the particular applications 
... contemplated by the legislators. This is especially 
true in the field of patent law.” Chakrabarty, 
447 U.S. at 315-16, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citing 
Barr v. United States, 324 U.S. 83, 90, 65 S.Ct. 
522, 89 L.Ed. 765 (1945); Browder v. United 
States, 312 U.S. 335, 339, 61 S.Ct. 599, 85 L.Ed. 
862 (1941); Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., 302 U.S. 253, 
257, 58 S.Ct. 167, 82 L.Ed. 235 (1937)). The meaning 
of the statutory term “process” is not limited by 
particular examples from more than two hundred 
years ago. 
However, I cannot resist pointing to the 
“business method” patents on Woodcroft's list. See 
concurring op. at 973 (citing No. 1197 to John 
Knox (July 21, 1778) (“Plan for assurances on lives 
of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.”)). Several 
other process patents on Woodcroft's list appear to 
involve financial subject matter, and to require 
primarily human activity. See, e.g., No. 1170 to 
John Molesworth (Sept. 29, 1777) (“Securing to the 
purchasers of shares and chances of state-lottery 
tickets any prize drawn in their favor.”); No. 1159 
to William Nicholson (July 14, 1777) (“Securing 
the property of persons purchasing shares of State-
lottery tickets.”), cited in Bennet Woodcroft, Alphabetical 
Index of Patentees of Inventions 383, 
410 (U.S. ed.1969). Other English process patents 
from the several decades following 1793 can aptly 

be described as “business methods,” although not 
performed with the aid of computers. E.g., No. 
10,367 to George Robert D'Harcourt (Oct. 29, 
1844) (“Ascertaining and checking the number of 
checks or tickets which have been used and 
marked, applicable for railway officers.”). 

While most patents of an earlier era reflect the 
dominant mechanical and chemical technologies of 
that era, modern processes reflect the dramatic advances 
in telecommunications and computing that 
have occurred since the time of George III. See 
USPTO White Paper, Automated Financial or Management 
Data Processing Methods (Business Methods) 
4 (2000), available at http:// www. uspto. gov/ 
web/ menu/ busmethp/ whitepaper. pdf (hereinafter 
USPTO White Paper) (“The full arrival of electricity 
as a component in business data processing 
system[s] was a watershed event.”). It is apparent 
that economic, or “business method,” or “human 
activity” patents were neither explicitly nor implicitly 
foreclosed from access to the English patent 
system. 

Evolution of process patents in the United States 

The United States' history of patenting establishes 
the same point. The PTO has located various 
patents predating modern computer usages that can 
be described as financial or business methods. The 
USPTO White Paper at 3-4 and appendix A describes 
the history of financial apparatus and method 
patents dating back to 1799, including patents on 
bank notes, bills of *990 credit, bills of exchange, 
check blanks, detecting and preventing counterfeiting, 
coin counting, interest calculation tables, and 
lotteries, all within the first fifty years of the United 
States patent system. It is a distortion of these patents 
to describe the processes as “tied to” another 
statutory category-that is, paper and pencil. Concurring 
op. at 974-75 & n. 18. Replacement of paper 
with a computer screen, and pencil with electrons, 
does not “untie” the process. Fairly considered, the 
many older financial and business-oriented patents 
that the PTO and many of the amici have identified 
are of the same type as the Bilski claims; they were

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

surely not rendered patent-eligible solely because 
they used “paper” to instantiate the financial 
strategies and transactions that comprised their contribution. 


I do not disagree with the general suggestion 
that statutes intended to codify the existing common 
law are to be interpreted in light of then-
contemporary practice, including, if relevant, the 
English cases. See concurring op. at 972-73. 
However, the court must be scrupulous in assessing 
the relevance of decisions that were formulated on 
particularized facts involving the technology of the 
period. The United States Supreme Court has never 
held that “process” inventions suffered a second-
class status under our statutes, achieving patent eligibility 
only derivatively through an explicit “tie” 
to another statutory category. The Court has repeatedly 
disparaged efforts to read in restrictions 
not based on statutory language. See Diehr, 450 

U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048; Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 
at 308, 100 S.Ct. 2204. Yet second-class status is 
today engrafted on “process” inventions. There is 
plainly no basis for such restriction, which is a direct 
path to the “gloomy thought” that concerned 
Senator O.H. Platt in his Remarks in Congress at 
the Centennial Proceedings of the United States 
Patent System: 
For one, I cannot entertain the gloomy thought 
that we have come to that century in the world's 
life in which new and grander achievements are 
impossible.... Invention is a prolific mother; 
every inventive triumph stimulates new effort. 
Man never is and never will be content with success, 
and the great secrets of nature are as yet 
largely undiscovered.

in United States Bicentennial Commemorative Edition 
of Proceedings and Addresses: Celebration of 
the Beginning of the Second Century of the American 
Patent System 75-76 (1990). 

In sum, history does not support the retrogression 
sponsored by the concurrence. 

This court now rejects its own CCPA and Federal 
Circuit precedent 

The majority opinion holds that there is a Supreme 
Court restriction on process patents, 
“enunciated” in Benson, Flook, and Diehr; and that 
this restriction was improperly ignored by the Federal 
Circuit and the Court of Customs and Patent 
Appeals, leading us into error which we must now 
correct. Thus this court announces that our prior decisions 
may no longer be relied upon. Maj. op. at 
959-60 & nn. 17, 19. The effect on the patents and 
businesses that did rely on them is not considered. 

The Court's decisions in Benson, Flook, and 
Diehr all reached the Supreme Court by way of the 
CCPA, and the CCPA successively implemented 
the Court's guidance in establishing the Freeman/ 
Walter/ Abele test for eligibility under Section 101. 
The Federal Circuit continued to consider computer-
facilitated processes, as in Arrhythmia Research 
Technology, 958 F.2d at 1059-60, where 
patent-eligibility was confirmed for a computer-assisted 
*991 mathematical analysis of electrocardiograph 
signals that determined the likelihood of recurrence 
of heart attack. This court now rules that 
this precedent “should no longer be relied on.” Maj. 
op. at 959 n. 17. 

In In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed.Cir.1994) ( 
en banc ) the question was the eligibility for patent 
of a rasterizer that mathematically transforms data 
to eliminate aliasing in a digital oscilloscope. The 
court held that a computer-implemented system that 
produces a “useful, concrete, and tangible result” is 
Section 101 subject matter. Id. at 1544. This court 
now rules that “a ‘useful, concrete and tangible result’ 
analysis should no longer be relied on.” Maj. 
op. at 960 n. 19. 

The Alappat court stressed the intent, embodied 
in the language of the statute, that the patent system 
be broadly available to new and useful inventions: 

The use of the expansive term “any” in § 101 represents 
Congress's intent not to place any restrictions 
on the subject matter for which a patent

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

may be obtained beyond those specifically recited 
in § 101 and other parts of Title 35. 

33 F.3d at 1542. This court looked to the Supreme 
Court's guidance in its Section 101 decisions, 
and explained: 

A close analysis of Diehr, Flook, and Benson re


veals that the Supreme Court never intended to 

create an overly broad, fourth category of 

[mathematical] subject matter excluded from § 

101. Rather, at the core of the Court's analysis in 
each of these cases lies an attempt by the Court to 
explain a rather straightforward concept, namely, 
that certain types of mathematical subject matter, 
standing alone, represent nothing more than abstract 
ideas until reduced to some type of practical 
application, and thus that subject matter is not, 
in and of itself, entitled to patent protection. 
Id. at 1543 (emphasis in original). The court 
cited the Supreme Court's distinction between abstract 
ideas and their practical application, and 
stated of the claimed rasterizer: “This is not a disembodied 
mathematical concept which may be 
characterized as an ‘abstract idea,’ but rather a specific 
machine to produce a useful, concrete, and 
tangible result.” Id. at 1544. 

This principle was applied to a computer-
implemented data processing system for managing 
pooled mutual fund assets in State Street Bank & 
Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1998), and to a method for recording 
and processing telephone data in AT & T v. 
Excel. The court explained that processes that include 
mathematical calculations in a practical application 
can produce a useful, concrete, and tangible 
result, which in State Street Bank was 
“expressed in numbers, such as price, profit, percentage, 
cost, or loss.” 149 F.3d at 1375. In AT & T 

v. Excel the court applied State Street Bank and 
Diehr, and stated that “physical transformation ... is 
not an invariable requirement, but merely one example 
of how a mathematical algorithm may bring 
about a useful application” and thus achieve a useful, 
concrete, and tangible result. 172 F.3d at 1358. 
This analysis, too, can no longer be relied on. Maj. 
op. at 960 n. 19. 

The now-discarded criterion of a “useful, concrete, 
and tangible result” has proved to be of ready 
and comprehensible applicability in a large variety 
of processes of the information and digital ages. 
The court in State Street Bank reinforced the thesis 
that there is no reason, in statute or policy, to exclude 
computer-implemented and information-
based inventions from access to patentability. The 
holdings and reasoning of Alappat and State Street 
Bank guided *992 the inventions of the electronic 
age into the patent system, while remaining faithful 
to the Diehr distinction between abstract ideas such 
as mathematical formulae and their application in a 
particular process for a specified purpose. And patentability 
has always required compliance with all 
of the requirements of the statute, including novelty, 
non-obviousness, utility, and the provisions of 
Section 112. 

The public has relied on the rulings of this court 
and of the Supreme Court 

The decisions in Alappat and State Street Bank 
confirmed the patent eligibility of many evolving 
areas of commerce, as inventors and investors explored 
new technological capabilities. The public 
and the economy have experienced extraordinary 
advances in information-based and computer-managed 
processes, supported by an enlarging patent 
base. The PTO reports that in Class 705, the examination 
classification associated with “business 
methods” and most likely to receive inventions that 
may not use machinery or transform physical matter, 
there were almost 10,000 patent applications 
filed in FY 2006 alone, and over 40,000 applications 
filed since FY 98 when State Street Bank was 
decided. See Wynn W. Coggins, USPTO, Update 
on Business Methods for the Business Methods 
Partnership Meeting 6 (2007) (hereinafter “ PTO 
Report ”), available at http:// www. uspto. gov/

these interests, the consequences of our decision 
have not been considered. I don't know how much 
human creativity and commercial activity will be 
devalued by today's change in law; but neither do 
my colleagues. 

The Section 101 interpretation that is now uprooted 
has the authority of years of reliance, and 
ought not be disturbed absent the most compelling 
reasons. “Considerations of stare decisis have special 
force in the area of statutory interpretation, for 
here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, 
the legislative power is implicated, and 
Congress remains free to alter what [the courts] 
have done.” Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 
23, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) 
(quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 

U.S. 164, 172-73, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 
(1989)); see also Hilton v. S.C. Pub. Railways 
Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 205, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 
L.Ed.2d 560 (1991) (in cases of statutory interpretation 
the importance of adhering to prior rulings is 
“most compelling”). Where, as here, Congress has 
not acted to modify the statute in the many years 
since Diehr and the decisions of this court, the 
force of stare decisis is even stronger. See Shepard, 
544 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254. 
Adherence to settled law, resulting in settled 
expectations, is of particular importance “in cases 
involving property and contract rights, where reliance 
interests are involved.” Payne v. Tennessee, 
501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 
720 (1991); see also United States v. Title Ins. & 
Trust Co., 265 U.S. 472, 486, 44 S.Ct. 621, 68 
L.Ed. 1110 (1924) (declining to overrule precedent

where prior ruling “has become a rule of property, 
and to disturb it now would be fraught with many 
injurious results”). This rationale is given no weight 
by my colleagues, as this court gratuitously disrupts 
decades of law underlying our own rulings. The 
only announced support for today's change appears 
to be the strained new reading of Supreme Court 
quotations. But this court has previously read these 
decades-old opinions differently, without objection 
by either Congress or the Court. My colleagues do 
not state a reason for their change of heart. See 
Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial 
Process 149 (1921) (“[T]he labor of judges would 
be increased almost to the breaking point if every 
past decision could be reopened in every case, and 
one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the 
secure foundation of the courses laid by others who 
had gone before him.”). 

It is the legislature's role to change the law if 
the public interest so requires. In Chakrabarty the 
Court stated: “The choice we are urged to make is a 
matter of high policy for resolution within the legislative 
process after the kind of investigation, examination, 
and study that legislative bodies can 
provide and courts cannot.” 447 U.S. at 317, 100 
S.Ct. 2204; see also Flook, 437 U.S. at 595, 98 
S.Ct. 2522 (“Difficult questions of policy concerning 
the kinds of programs that may be appropriate 
for patent protection and the form and duration of 
such protection can be answered by Congress on 
the basis of current empirical data not equally available 
to this tribunal.”). 

It is, however, the judicial obligation to assure 
a correct, just, and reliable judicial process, and 
particularly to respect the principles of stare decisis 
in an area in which prior and repeated statutory interpretations 
have been relied upon by others. See, 
e.g., *994Shepard, 544 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254 
(“[T]he claim to adhere to case law is generally 
powerful once a decision has settled statutory 
meaning.”); Hilton, 502 U.S. at 202, 112 S.Ct. 560 
(“Adherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability, 
and respect for judicial authority.”); 

Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (“Stare decisis 
is the preferred course because it promotes the 
evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development 
of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial 
decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived 
integrity of the judicial process.”). These 
considerations appear to be abandoned. 

Uncertain guidance for the future 

Not only past expectations, but future hopes, 
are disrupted by uncertainty as to application of the 
new restrictions on patent eligibility. For example, 
the court states that even if a process is “tied to” a 
machine or transforms matter, the machine or transformation 
must impose “meaningful limits” and 
cannot constitute “insignificant extra-solution activity”. 
Maj. op. at 961-62. We are advised that transformation 
must be “central to the purpose of the 
claimed process,” id., although we are not told what 
kinds of transformations may qualify, id. at 962-63. 
These concepts raise new conflicts with precedent. 

This court and the Supreme Court have stated 
that “there is no legally recognizable or protected 
‘essential’ element, ‘gist’ or ‘heart’ of the invention 
in a combination patent.” Allen Eng'g Corp. v. Bar-
tell Industries, Inc., 299 F.3d 1336, 1345 
(Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible 
Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 345, 81 
S.Ct. 599, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961)). This rule applies 
with equal force to process patents, see W.L. Gore 
& Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F.2d 1540, 
1548 (Fed.Cir.1983) (there is no gist of the invention 
rule for process patents), and is in accord with 
the rule that the invention must be considered as a 
whole, rather than “dissected,” in assessing its patent 
eligibility under Section 101, see Diehr, 450 

U.S. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048. It is difficult to predict 
an adjudicator's view of the “invention as a whole,” 
now that patent examiners and judges are instructed 
to weigh the different process components for their 
“centrality” and the “significance” of their 
“extra-solution activity” in a Section 101 inquiry. 
As for whether machine implementation will 
impose “meaningful limits in a particular case,” the

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

“meaningfulness” of computer usage in the great 
variety of technical and informational subject matter 
that is computer-facilitated is apparently now a 
flexible parameter of Section 101. Each patent examination 
center, each trial court, each panel of this 
court, will have a blank slate on which to uphold or 
invalidate claims based on whether there are sufficient 
“meaningful limits”, or whether a transformation 
is adequately “central,” or the “significance” of 
process steps. These qualifiers, appended to a novel 
test which itself is neither suggested nor supported 
by statutory text, legislative history, or judicial precedent, 
raise more questions than they answer. 
These new standards add delay, uncertainty, and 
cost, but do not add confidence in reliable standards 
for Section 101. 

Other aspects of the changes of law also contribute 
uncertainty. We aren't told when, or if, software 
instructions implemented on a general purpose 
computer are deemed “tied” to a “particular machine,” 
for if Alappat's guidance that software converts 
a general purpose computer into a special purpose 
machine remains applicable, there is no need 
for the present ruling. For the thousands of inventors 
who obtained patents under the court's nowdiscarded*
995 criteria, their property rights are 
now vulnerable. 

The court also avoids saying whether the State 
Street Bank and AT & T v. Excel inventions would 
pass the new test. The drafting of claims in machine 
or process form was not determinative in those 
cases, for “we consider the scope of § 101 to be the 
same regardless of the form-machine or process-in 
which a particular claim is drafted.” AT & T v. Excel, 
172 F.3d at 1357. From either the machine or 
the transformation viewpoint, the processing of data 
representing “price, profit, percentage, cost, or 
loss” in State Street Bank is not materially different 
from the processing of the Bilski data representing 
commodity purchase and sale prices, market transactions, 
and risk positions; yet Bilski is held to fail 
our new test, while State Street is left hanging. The 
uncertainty is illustrated in the contemporaneous 

decision of In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 1365, 1378-79 
(Fed.Cir.2007), where the court held that “systems 
that depend for their operation on human intelligence 
alone” to solve practical problems are not 
within the scope of Section 101; and In re Nuijten, 
500 F.3d 1346, 1353-54 (Fed.Cir.2007), where the 
court held that claims to a signal with an embedded 
digital watermark encoded according to a given encoding 
process were not directed to statutory subject 
matter under Section 101, although the claims 
included “physical but transitory forms of signal 
transmission such as radio broadcasts, electrical 
signals through a wire, and light pluses through a 
fiber-optic cable.” 

Although this uncertainty may invite some to 
try their luck in court, the wider effect will be a disincentive 
to innovation-based commerce. For inventors, 
investors, competitors, and the public, the 
most grievous consequence is the effect on inventions 
not made or not developed because of uncertainty 
as to patent protection. Only the successes 
need the patent right. 

The Bilski invention has not been examined for 
patentability 

To be patentable, Bilski's invention must be 
novel and non-obvious, and the specification and 
claims must meet the requirements of enablement, 
description, specificity, best mode, etc. See 35 

U.S.C. § 101 (“Whoever invents or discovers a new 
and useful process ... may obtain a patent therefor, 
subject to the conditions and requirements of this 
title.”); Diehr, 450 U.S. at 190, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (the 
question of whether an invention is novel is distinct 
from whether the subject matter is statutory); State 
Street Bank, 149 F.3d at 1377 (“Whether the patent's 
claims are too broad to be patentable is not to 
be judged under § 101, but rather under §§ 102, 103 
, and 112.”). I don't know whether Bilski can meet 
these requirements-but neither does this court, for 
the claims have not been examined for patentability, 
and no rejections apart from Section 101 are included 
in this appeal. 
Instead, the court states the “true issue before

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

us” is “whether Applicants are seeking to claim a 
fundamental principle (such as an abstract idea) or 
mental process,” maj. op. at 952, and answers 
“yes.” With respect, that is the wrong question, and 
the wrong answer. Bilski's patent application describes 
his process of analyzing the effects of supply 
and demand on commodity prices and the use 
of a coupled transaction strategy to hedge against 
these risks; this is not a fundamental principle or an 
abstract idea; it is not a mental process or a law of 
nature. It is a “process,” set out in successive steps, 
for obtaining and analyzing information and carrying 
out a series of commercial transactions for the 
purpose of “managing the consumption risk costs of 
a commodity *996 sold by a commodity provider at 
a fixed price.” Claim 1, preamble. 

Because the process Bilski describes employs 
complex mathematical calculations to assess various 
elements of risk, any practicable embodiment 
would be conducted with the aid of a machine-a 
programmed computer-but the court holds that 
since computer-implementation is not recited in 
claim 1, for that reason alone the process fails the 
“machine” part of the court's machine-
or-transformation test. Maj. op. at 962. And the 
court holds that since Bilski's process involves the 
processing of data concerning commodity prices 
and supply and demand and other risk factors, the 
process fails the “transformation” test because no 
“physical objects or substances” are transformed. 
Maj. op. at 963-64. The court then concludes that 
because Bilski's Claim 1 fails the machine-
or-transformation test it ipso facto preempts a 
“fundamental principle” and is thereby barred from 
the patent system under Section 101: an illogical 
leap that displays the flaws in the court's analysis. 

If a claim is unduly broad, or if it fails to include 
sufficient specificity, the appropriate ground 
of rejection is Section 112, for claims must 
“particularly point out and distinctly claim[ ]” the 
invention. See In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 495-96 
(Fed.Cir.1991) (affirming rejection under Section 
112 where “[t]here is no reasonable correlation 

between the narrow disclosure in applicant's specification 
and the broad scope of protection sought 
in the claims”); In re Foster, 58 C.C.P.A. 1001, 438 
F.2d 1011, 1016 (1971) (claims “not commensurate 
with appellants' own definition of what they are 
seeking to cover” are rejected under Section 112, 
rather than Section 101); In re Prater, 415 F.2d at 
1403-04 (applying Section 112 to claims that included 
mental steps). The filing of a broader claim 
than is supported in the specification does not convert 
the invention into an abstraction and evict the 
application from eligibility for examination. A 
broad first claim in a patent application is routine; it 
is not the crisis event postulated in the court's opinion. 


The role of examination is to determine the 
scope of the claims to which the applicant is entitled. 
See 37 C.F.R. § 1.104(a). The PTO's regulations 
provide: 

On taking up an application for examination or a 
patent in a reexamination proceeding, the examiner 
shall make a thorough study thereof and 
shall make a thorough investigation of the available 
prior art relating to the subject matter of the 
claimed invention. The examination shall be 
complete with respect to both compliance of the 
application or patent under reexamination with 
the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability 
of the invention as claimed, as well as 
with respect to matters of form, unless otherwise 
indicated. 

Id. § 1.104(a)(1). The Manual of Patent Examining 
Procedure (MPEP) similarly instructs the 
examiners to conduct a “thorough search of the prior 
art” before evaluating the invention under Section 
101. MPEP § 2106(III) (8th ed., rev.7, July.
2008) (“Prior to evaluating the claimed invention 
under 35 U.S.C. § 101, USPTO personnel are expected 
to conduct a thorough search of the prior 
art.”). The MPEP also requires examiners to identify 
all grounds of rejection in the first official PTO 
action to avoid unnecessary delays in examination. 
Id. § 2106(II) (“Under the principles of compact

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

prosecution, each claim should be reviewed for 
compliance with every statutory requirement for 
patentability in the initial review of the application, 
even if one or more claims are found to be deficient 
with respect to some statutory requirement.”). I 
note that this *997 requirement does not appear to 
have been here met. 

Several amici curiae referred to the difficulties 
that the PTO has reported in examining patents in 
areas where the practice has been to preserve 
secrecy, for published prior art is sparse. The Federal 
Trade Commission recognized that the problem 
of “questionable” patents stems mostly from “the 
difficulty patent examiners can have in considering 
all the relevant prior art in the field and staying informed 
about the rapid advance of computer science.” 
FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper 
Balance of Competition & Patent Law and Policy at 
ch. 3, pp. 44 (Oct.2003), available at http:// www. 
ftc. gov/ os/ 2003/ 10/ innovationrpt. pdf. However, 
this problem seems to be remedied, for the PTO reported 
in 2007 that for Class 705, “[t]he cases the 
examiners are now working on have noticeably narrower 
claims” than the cases filed in or before FY 
2000. PTO Report at 9. The PTO reports that its 
search fields have been enlarged, staff added, and 
supervision augmented. FTC Report at ch. 1, p. 30. 
(“Since the PTO introduced [these changes] the allowance 
rate for business method patents has decreased, 
and the PTO believes that this decreased 
allowance rate indicates improved PTO searches for 
prior art.”). If this court's purpose now is to improve 
the quality of issued patents by eliminating 
access to patenting for large classes of past, 
present, and future inventions, the remedy would 
appear to be excessive. 

A straightforward, efficient, and ultimately fair 
approach to the evaluation of “new and useful” processes-
quoting Section 101-is to recognize that a 
process invention that is not clearly a “fundamental 
truth, law of nature, or abstract idea” is eligible for 
examination for patentability. I do not suggest that 
basic scientific discoveries are a proper subject 

matter of patents (the Court in Chakrabarty men


2

tioned E=mc and the law of gravity), and I do not 
attempt an all-purpose definition of the boundary 
between scientific theory and technological application. 
But it is rare indeed that a question arises at 
the boundary of basic science; more usual is the 
situation illustrated by Samuel Morse's telegraph, in 
which the Court simply held that Morse's general 
claim was “too broad,” exceeding the scope of his 
practical application. 

Bilski's process for determining risk in commodity 
transactions does not become an abstraction 
because it is broadly claimed in his first claim. It 
may be claimed so broadly that it reads on the prior 
art, but it is neither a fundamental truth nor an abstraction. 
Bilski's ten other claims contain further 
details and limitations, removing them farther from 
abstraction. Although claim 1 may have been 
deemed “representative” with respect to Section 
101, the differences among the claims may be significant 
with respect to Sections 102, 103, and 112. 
Bilski's application, now pending for eleven years, 
has yet to be examined for patentability. 

CONCLUSION 

In sum, the text of Section 101, its statutory 
history, its interpretation by the Supreme Court, 
and its application by the courts, contravene this 
court's redefinition of the statutory term “process.” 
The court's decision affects present and future 
rights and incentives, and usurps the legislative 
role. The judicial role is to support stability and 
predictability in the law, with fidelity to statute and 
precedent, and respect for the principles of stare 
decisis. 

Patents provide an incentive to invest in and 
work in new directions. In United States v. Line 
Material Co., 333 U.S. 287, 332, 68 S.Ct. 550, 92 
L.Ed. 701 (1948), Justice Burton, joined by Chief 
Justice *998 Vinson and Justice Frankfurter, remarked 
that “the frontiers of science have expanded 
until civilization now depends largely upon discoveries 
on those frontiers to meet the infinite needs of 
the future. The United States, thus far, has taken a

leading part in making those discoveries and in putting 
them to use.” This remains true today. It is antithetical 
to this incentive to restrict eligibility for 
patenting to what has been done in the past, and to 
foreclose what might be done in the future. 

MAYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

The en banc order in this case asked: “Whether 
it is appropriate to reconsider State Street Bank & 
Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1998), and AT&T Corp.v.Excel 
Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d 1352 
(Fed.Cir.1999), in this case and, if so, whether 
those cases should be overruled in any respect?” I 
would answer that question with an emphatic “yes.” 
The patent system is intended to protect and promote 
advances in science and technology, not ideas 
about how to structure commercial transactions. 
Claim 1 of the application of Bernard L. Bilski and 
Rand A. Warsaw (“Bilski”) is not eligible for patent 
protection because it is directed to a method of conducting 
business. Affording patent protection to 
business methods lacks constitutional and statutory 
support, serves to hinder rather than promote innovation 
and usurps that which rightfully belongs in 
the public domain. State Street and AT & T should 
be overruled. 

I. 
In discussing the scope of copyright protection, 
the Supreme Court has noted that “ ‘a page of history 
is worth a volume of logic.’ ” Eldred v. Ashcroft, 
537 U.S. 186, 200, 123 S.Ct. 769, 154 
L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) (quoting New York Trust Co. v. 
Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.Ct. 506, 65 L.Ed. 
963 (1921)). The same holds true with respect to 
patent protection. From a historical perspective, it 
is highly unlikely that the framers of the Constitution's 
intellectual property clause intended to grant 
patent protection to methods of conducting business. 
To the contrary, “those who formulated the 
Constitution were familiar with the long struggle 
over monopolies so prominent in English history, 
where exclusive rights to engage even in ordinary 
business activities were granted so frequently by 

the Crown for the financial benefits accruing to the 
Crown only.” In re Yuan, 38 C.C.P.A. 967, 188 
F.2d 377, 380 (1951). The Statute of Monopolies, 

FN1 

enacted in 1624, curtailed the Crown's ability 
to grant “monopolies to court favorites in goods or 
businesses which had long before been enjoyed by 
the public.” Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 
5, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). When 
drafting the Constitution, the framers were well 
aware of the abuses that led to the English Statute 
of Monopolies and therefore “consciously acted to 
bar Congress from granting letters patent in particular 
types of business.” In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 
1365, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2007); see also Malla Pollack, 
The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method 
Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Consideration, 
and Constitutional History, 28 Rutgers 
Computer & Tech. L.J. 61, 90 (2002) (“[T]he ratifying 
generation did not agree to invention patents 
on advances in *999 trade itself, because trade 
monopolies were odious.”). 

FN1. The Statute of Monopolies “grew out 
of abuses in the grant of exclusive franchises 
in various lines of business such as 
trading cards, alehouses and various staple 
products.” Robert P. Merges, As Many as 
Six Impossible Patents Before Breakfast: 
Property Rights for Business Concepts and 
Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech. 

L.J. 577, 585 (1999). 
There is nothing in the early patent statutes to 
indicate that Congress intended business methods 
to constitute patentable subject matter. See Patent 
Act of 1790 § 4, 1 Stat. 109, 111 (1790); Patent Act 
of 1793 § 1, 1 Stat. 318, 319 (1793); Pollack, supra 
at 106 (“[I]f any nation was ripe for invention patents 
on business methods, it was the newly freed 
colonies of British North America.... [H]owever, no 
business method patents seem to have been granted.”). 
As early as 1869, the Commissioner of Patents 
said that “[i]t is contrary ... to the spirit of the 
law, as construed by the office for many years, to 
grant patents for methods of book-keeping,” Ex

160 F. 467, 469 (2d Cir.1908) (“A system of transacting 
business disconnected from the means for 
carrying out the system is not, within the most liberal 
interpretation of the term, an art.”); In re 
Moeser, 27 App. D.C. 307, 310 (1906) (holding 
that a system for burial insurance contracts was not 
patentable because “contracts or proposals for contracts, 
devised or adopted as a method of transacting 
a particular class of ... business, [are] not patentable 
as an art”); see also 145 Cong. Rec. H6,947 
(Aug. 3, 1999) (statement of Rep. Manzullo) 
(“Before the State Street Bank and Trust case ... it 
was universally thought that methods of doing or 
conducting business were not patentable items.”). 
In passing the 1952 Act, Congress re-enacted 

FN2

statutory language that had long existed,thus 
signaling its intent to carry forward the body of 
case law that had developed under prior versions of 
the statute. Because there is nothing in the language 
of the 1952 Act, or its legislative history, to indicate 
that Congress intended to modify the rule 
against patenting business methods, we must presume 
that no change in the rule was intended. See, 
e.g., Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino, 

501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 
(1991) (“[W]here a common-law principle is well 
established ... the courts may take it as given that 
Congress has legislated with an expectation that the 
principle will apply except when a statutory purpose 
to the contrary is evident.” (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted)); Isbrandtsen Co. v. 
Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783, 72 S.Ct. 1011, 96 
L.Ed. 1294 (1952) (“Statutes which invade the 
common law ... are to be read with a presumption 
favoring the retention of long-established *1000 
and familiar principles, except when a statutory 
purpose to the contrary is evident.”); see also In re 
Schrader, 22 F.3d 290, 295 (Fed.Cir.1994) (“When 
Congress approved the addition of the term 
‘process' to the categories of patentable subject 
matter in 1952, it incorporated the definition of 
‘process' that had evolved in the courts.” (footnote 
omitted)). If Congress had wished to change the established 
practice of disallowing patents on business 
methods, it was quite capable of doing so explicitly. 
See Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 596, 98 
S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978) (stressing that 
courts “must proceed cautiously when ... asked to 
extend patent rights into areas wholly unforeseen 
by Congress”). 

FN2. Congress did substitute the word 
“process” for “art” in the 1952 Act, but 
“[a]nalysis of the eligibility of a claim of 
patent protection for a ‘process' did not 
change with the addition of that term to § 
101.” Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 
184, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 
(1981). 

State Street's decision to jettison the prohibition 
against patenting methods of doing business 
contravenes congressional intent. Because (1) “the 
framers consciously acted to bar Congress from 
granting letters patent in particular types of business,” 
Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1375, and (2) Congress 
evidenced no intent to modify the long-
established rule against business method patents 
when it enacted the 1952 Patent Act, it is hard to

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

fathom how the issuance of patents on business 
methods can be supported. 

II. 
Business method patents have been justified, in 
significant measure, by a misapprehension of the 
legislative history of the 1952 Patent Act. In particular, 
proponents of such patents have asserted that 
the Act's legislative history states that Congress intended 
statutory subject matter to “include anything 
under the sun that is made by man.” AT & T, 172 
F.3d at 1355 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted); see also Diamond v. 
Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 
L.Ed.2d 144 (1980). Read in context, however, the 
legislative history says no such thing. The full 
statement from the committee report reads: “A person 
may have ‘invented’ a machine or a manufacture, 
which may include anything under the sun that 
is made by man, but it is not necessarily patentable 
under section 101 unless the conditions of the title 
are fulfilled.” S.Rep. No.1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 
5 (1952), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, 
pp. 2394, 2399 (emphasis added); H.R.Rep. 
No.1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1952) (emphasis 
added). 

This statement does not support the contention 
that Congress intended “anything under the sun” to 
be patentable. To the contrary, the language supports 
the opposite view: a person may have 
“invented” anything under the sun, but it is “not necessarily 
patentable” unless the statutory requirements 
for patentability have been satisfied. Thus, 
the legislative history oft-cited to support business 
method patents undercuts, rather than supports, the 
notion that Congress intended to extend the scope 
of section 101 to encompass such methods. 

Moreover, the cited legislative history is not 
discussing process claims at all. The quoted language 
is discussing “machines” and 
“manufactures;” it is therefore surprising that it has 
been thought a fit basis for allowing patents on 
business processes. 

III. 
The Constitution does not grant Congress unfettered 
authority to issue patents. See U.S. Const. 

FN3

art. I, § 8.Instead, the *1001 patent power is a 
“qualified authority ... [which] is limited to the promotion 
of advances in the ‘useful arts.’ ” Graham, 
383 U.S. at 5, 86 S.Ct. 684; see also KSR Int'l Co. 

v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 
1746, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007) (reaffirming that patents 
are designed to promote “the progress of useful 
arts”). What the framers described as “useful arts,” 
we in modern times call “technology.” Paulik v. 
Rizkalla, 760 F.2d 1270, 1276 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en 
banc). Therefore, by mandating that patents advance 
the useful arts, “[t]he Constitution explicitly 
limited patentability to ... ‘the process today called 
technological innovation.’ ” Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 
1375 (quoting Paulik, 760 F.2d at 1276); see also 
In re Foster, 58 C.C.P.A. 1001, 438 F.2d 1011 
(1971) (“All that is necessary ... to make a sequence 
of operational steps a statutory ‘process' within 35 
U.S.C. § 101 is that it be in the technological 
arts.”); Karl B. Lutz, Patents and Science: A Clarification 
of the Patent Clause of the U.S. Constitution, 
18 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 50, 54 (1949) (“The 
term ‘useful arts' as used in the Constitution ... is 
best represented in modern language by the word 
‘technology.’ ”); James S. Sfekas, Controlling Business 
Method Patents: How the Japanese Standard 
for Patenting Software Could Bring Reasonable 
Limitations to Business Method Patents in the 
United States, 16 Pac. Rim. L. & Pol'y J. 197, 214 
(2007) (At the time the Patent Clause was adopted, 
“the term ‘useful arts' was commonly used in contrast 
to the ideas of the ‘liberal arts' and the ‘fine 
arts,’ which were well-known ideas in the eighteenth 
century.”). 
FN3. Article I, § 8 provides that “The Congress 
shall have Power ... To promote the 
Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing 
for limited Times to Authors and 
Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective 
Writings and Discoveries.” The 
patent power “is the only one of the sever

al powers conferred upon the Congress 
which is accompanied by a specific statement 
of the reason for it.” Yuan, 188 F.2d 
at 380. 

Before State Street led us down the wrong path, 
this court had rightly concluded that patents were 
designed to protect technological innovations, not

ideas about the best way to run a business.We 
had *1002 thus rejected as unpatentable a method 
for coordinating firefighting efforts, Patton, 127 
F.2d at 326-27, a method for deciding how salesmen 
should best handle customers, In re Maucorps, 
609 F.2d 481 (CCPA 1979), and a computerized 
method for aiding a neurologist in diagnosing patients, 
In re Meyer, 688 F.2d 789 (CCPA 1982). 

FN5 

We stated that patentable processes must “be 
in the technological arts so as to be in consonance 
with the Constitutional purpose to promote the progress 
of ‘useful arts.’ ” In re Musgrave, 57 

C.C.P.A. 1352, 431 F.2d 882, 893 (CCPA 1970) 
(emphasis added). 

FN4. “[D]espite the assertions in State 
Street and Schrader, very few in the patent 
community believe that business methods 
have always been patentable. To the contrary, 
the dominant view is that the law has 
changed, and that the definition of patentable 
subject matter is now wider than it 
once was.” R. Carl Moy, Subjecting Rembrandt 
to the Rule of Law: Rule-Based 
Solutions for Determining the Patentability 
of Business Methods, 28 Wm. Mitchell 
L.Rev. 1047, 1060 (2002) (footnotes omitted); 
see also Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss, 
Are Business Method Patents Bad for Business?, 
16 Santa Clara Computer & High 
Tech. L.J. 263, 265-66 (2000) (State Street 

gave “judicial recognition to business 
method patents.”). Over the course of two 
centuries, a few patents issued on what 
could arguably be deemed methods of doing 
business, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 
5,664,115 (“Interactive Computer System 

to Match Buyers and Sellers of Real Estate, 
Businesses and Other Property Using 
the Internet”), but these patents were aberrations 
and the general rule, prior to State 
Street, was that methods of engaging in 
business were ineligible for patent protection. 
See Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1374 
(noting that “[a]t one time, ‘[t]hough seemingly 
within the category of process or 
method, a method of doing business [was] 
rejected as not being within the statutory 
classes.’ ” (quoting State Street, 149 F.3d 
at 1377)). One commentator has noted that 
although the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office (“USPTO”) “in an attempt 
to deflect criticism [has] issued an 
apologia ... asserting that business method 
patents are as old as the United States patent 
system,” this document is fundamentally 
flawed. See Pollack, supra at 73-75. 
She explains: 

The USPTO wants us to believe that it 
found no records of patents whose points 
of invention were business methods, because 
no one had time to invent any new 
business methods until the human race 
had run its mechanical ingenuity to the 
peak of computer software; seemingly 
we were all too busy inventing the computer 
to think about anything else-
especially new ways of doing business. I 
thought that we granted patents because, 
otherwise, people would be too busy 
making money by running businesses to 
take time out to invent anything except 
business methods. The USPTO 
[document], furthermore, is eliding the 
printed matter exception to patentable 
subject matter with the business method 
exception.

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

ted to a business method, while the claims 
in Maucorps and Meyer were rejected as 
attempts to patent mathematical algorithms. 
Subsequently, however, this 
court stated that the claimed processes in 
Maucorps and Meyer were directed toward 
business systems and should therefore not 
be considered patent eligible. In re Alappat, 
33 F.3d 1526, 1541 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en 
banc). We noted that “ Maucorps dealt 
with a business methodology for deciding 
how salesmen should best handle respective 
customers and Meyer involved a 
‘system’ for aiding a neurologist in diagnosing 
patients. Clearly, neither of the alleged 
‘inventions' in those cases falls within 
any § 101 category.” Id. 

Business method patents do not promote the 
“useful arts” because they are not directed to any 
technological or scientific innovation. Although 
business method applications may use technology-
such as computers-to accomplish desired results, 
the innovative aspect of the claimed method is an 
entrepreneurial rather than a technological one. 
Thus, although Bilski's claimed hedging method 
could theoretically be implemented on a computer, 
that alone does not render it patentable. See Diehr, 
450 U.S. at 192 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (Patentability 
cannot be established by the “token” use of technology.); 
Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 64-66, 
93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972) (finding unpatentable 
a method of programming a general purpose 
digital computer to convert signals from binary-
coded decimal to pure binary form). Where a 
claimed business method simply uses a known machine 
to do what it was designed to do, such as using 
a computer to gather data or perform calculations, 
use of that machine will not bring otherwise 
unpatentable subject matter within the ambit of section 
101. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253 
(finding a process unpatentable where “[t]he mathematical 
procedures [could] be carried out in existing 
computers long in use, no new machinery being 
necessary”). 

Although the Supreme Court has not directly 
addressed the patentability of business methods, 
several of its decisions implicitly tether patentability 
to technological innovation. See Pfaff v. Wells 
Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 63, 119 S.Ct. 304, 142 
L.Ed.2d 261 (1998) (“[T]he patent system represents 
a carefully crafted bargain that encourages 
both the creation and the public disclosure of new 
and useful advances in technology, in return for an 
exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time.” 
(emphasis added)); Markman v. Westview Instruments, 
Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 
L.Ed.2d 577 (1996) (“Congress created the Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit as an exclusive appellate 
court for patent cases ... observing that increased 
uniformity would strengthen the United 
States patent system in such a way as to foster technological 
growth and industrial innovation. ” 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) 
(emphasis added)); Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 
253 (refusing to “freeze [the patentability *1003 of] 
process patents to old technologies, leaving no 
room for the revelations of the new, onrushing technology 
” (emphases added)). Indeed, the Supreme 
Court has repeatedly emphasized that what renders 
subject matter patentable is “the application of the 
law of nature to a new and useful end.” Funk Bros. 
Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 130, 
68 S.Ct. 440, 92 L.Ed. 588 (1948); see Diehr, 450

FN6

at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253.Applying laws of nature to 
new and useful ends is nothing other than 

FN7

“technology.” See, e.g., Microsoft Computer 
Dictionary 513 (5th ed. 2002) (The definition of 
“technology” is the “application of science and engineering 
to the development of machines and procedures 
in order to enhance or improve human conditions.”); 
American Heritage Dictionary of the 
English Language 1777 (4th ed. 2000) 
(“Technology” is the “application of science, especially 
to industrial or commercial objectives.”); see

Court's holdings in Benson and Diehr are really 
stating a requirement that inventions must be technological.”);

and consistent body of Supreme Court case law establishes 
that the term ‘invention’ encompasses 
anything made by man that utilizes or harnesses 
one or more ‘laws of nature’ for human benefit.”). 
As the Supreme Court has made clear, “the act of 
invention ... consists neither in finding out the laws 
of nature, nor in fruitful research as to the operation 
of natural laws, but in discovering how those laws 
may be utilized or applied for some beneficial purpose, 
by a process, a device or a machine.” United 
States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178, 
188, 53 S.Ct. 554, 77 L.Ed. 1114 (1933). 

FN6. Laws of nature are those laws pertaining 
to the “natural sciences,” such as 
biology, chemistry, or physics. See, e.g., 
Webster's New International Dictionary 

1507 (3d ed. 2002) (“Natural sciences” are 
the “branches of science ( [such] as physics, 
chemistry, [or] biology) that deal with 
matter, energy, and their interrelations and 
transformations or with objectively measured 
phenomena.”). They must be distinguished 
from other types of law, such as 
laws of economics or statutory enactments. 
Laws of nature do not involve “judgments 
on human conduct, ethics, morals, economics, 
politics, law, aesthetics, etc.” Mus-
grave, 431 F.2d at 890; see also Joy Y. Xiang, 
How Wide Should the Gate of 
“Technology” Be? Patentability of Business 
Methods in China, 11 Pac. Rim L. & 
Pol'y J. 795, 807 (2002) (noting that State 
Street's “ ‘useful, concrete and tangible 
result’ test is inconsistent with the 
‘application of the law of nature’ patent 
eligibility scope outlined by the U.S. Supreme 
Court and [the Federal Circuit prior 
to State Street ].”). 

FN7. One commentator notes that both Japan 
and the Republic of Korea explicitly 
define an “invention” as the application of 
a law of nature, and argues that the United 
States should follow a similar approach to 

patentability. See Andrew A. Schwartz, 
The Patent Office Meets the Poison Pill: 
Why Legal Methods Cannot be Patented, 

20 Harv. J. Law & Tech. 333, 357 (2007). 

Methods of doing business do not apply “the 
law of nature to a new and useful end.” Because the 
innovative aspect of such methods is an entrepreneurial 
rather than a technological one, they should 
be deemed ineligible for patent protection. See, e.g., 
John R. Thomas, The Patenting of the Liberal Professions, 
40 B.C. L.Rev. 1139 (1999) (arguing that 
affording patentability to business methods opens 
the door to obtaining patent protection for all aspects 
of human thought and behavior, and that patents 
should remain grounded in science and technology) 
(hereinafter “Thomas (1999)”). “[T]he 
primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation 
of private fortunes for the owners of patents 
but is ‘to promote the progress of science and useful 
arts.’ ” *1004Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal 
Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 511, 37 S.Ct. 
416, 61 L.Ed. 871 (1917). Although business method 
patents may do much to enrich their owners, 
they do little to promote scientific research and 
technological innovation.

State Street has launched a legal tsunami, inundating 
the patent office with applications seeking

protection for common business practices.Applications 
for Class 705 (business method) patents 
increased from fewer than 1,000 applications in 
1997 to more than 11,000 applications in 2007. See

705 Application Filings and Patents Issued Data,

patents on methods of doing business. It 
passed the American Inventors Protection 
Act (commonly referred to as the First Inventor 
Defense Act) which provides an affirmative 
defense against a business method 
patent infringement action if the defendant 
“acting in good faith, actually reduced 
the subject matter to practice at least 
1 year before the effective filing date of 
such patent, and commercially used the 
subject matter before the effective filing 
date of such patent.” See 35 U.S.C. § 273. 
Even where a defendant may qualify for 
this defense, however, he “still must engage 
in expensive litigation where [he] 
bears the burden of affirmatively raising 
and proving the defense.” See Nicholas A. 
Smith, Business Method Patents and Their 
Limits: Justifications, History, and the 
Emergence of A Claim Construction Jurisprudence, 
9 Mich. Telecomm. & Tech. 
L.Rev. 171, 199 (2002). 

Patents granted in the wake of State Street have 
ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly 
absurd. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,851,117 
(method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using 
video displays); U.S. Patent No. 5,862,223 
(method for selling expert advice); U.S. Patent No. 
6,014,643 (method for trading securities); U.S. Patent 
No. 6,119,099 (method of enticing customers to 
order additional food at a fast food restaurant); U.S. 
Patent No. 6,329,919 (system for toilet reservations); 
U.S. Patent No. 7,255,277 (method of using 
color-coded bracelets to designate dating status in 
order to limit “the embarrassment of rejection”). 
There has even been a patent issued on a method 
for obtaining a patent. See U.S. Patent No. 
6,049,811. Not surprisingly, State Street and its 
progeny have generated a thundering chorus of criticism. 
See Leo J. Raskind, The State Street Bank 
Decision: The Bad Business of Unlimited Patent 
Protection for Methods of Doing Business, 10 Fordham 
Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L.J. 61, 61 (1999) 

(“The Federal Circuit's recent endorsement of pat


ent protection for methods of doing business marks 
so sweeping a departure from precedent as to invite 
a search for its justification.”); Pollack, supra at 
119-20 (arguing that State Street was based upon a 
misinterpretation of both the legislative history and 
the language of section 101 and that “business 
method patents are problematical both socially and 
constitutionally”); Price, supra at 155 (“The fall out 
from State Street has created a gold-rush mentality 
toward patents and litigation in which companies 
.... gobble up patents on anything and everything.... 
It is a mad rush to get as many dumb patents as 
possible.” (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted)); Thomas (1999), supra at 1160 (“After 
State Street, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that 
if you can name it, you can claim it.”); Sfekas, 
supra at 226 (“[T]he U.S. courts *1005 have set too 
broad a standard for patenting business methods.... 
These business method patents tend to be of lower 
quality and are unnecessary to achieve the goal of 
encouraging innovation in business.”); William 
Krause, Sweeping the E-Commerce Patent Minefield: 
The Need for a Workable Business Method 
Exception, 24 Seattle U.L.Rev. 79, 101 (2000) ( 
State Street “opened up a world of unlimited possession 
to anyone quick enough to take a business 
method and put it to use via computer software before 
anyone else.”); Moy, supra at 1051 (“To call 
[the situation following State Street ] distressing is 
an understatement. The consensus ... appears to be 
that patents should not be issuing for new business 
methods.”). 

There are a host of difficulties associated with 
allowing patents to issue on methods of conducting 
business. Not only do such patents tend to impede 
rather than promote innovation, they are frequently 
of poor quality. Most fundamentally, they raise significant 
First Amendment concerns by imposing 
broad restrictions on speech and the free flow of 
ideas.

the embarrassment of an exclusive patent,’ ... must 
outweigh the restrictive effect of the limited patent 
monopoly.” Graham, 383 U.S. at 10-11, 86 S.Ct. 
684 (quoting letter from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac 
McPherson (Aug. 1813)). Thus, Congress may not 
expand the scope of “the patent monopoly without 
regard to the ... advancement or social benefit 
gained thereby.” Id. at 6, 86 S.Ct. 684. 

Patents should be granted to those inventions 
“which would not be disclosed or devised but for 
the inducement of a patent.” Id. at 11, 86 S.Ct. 684. 
Methods of doing business have existed since the 
earliest days of the Patent Act and have flourished 
even in the absence of patent protection. See Brian 

P. Biddinger, Limiting the Business Method Patent: 
A Comparison and Proposed Alignment of 
European, Japanese and United States Patent Law, 
69 Fordham L.Rev. 2523, 2544-50 (2001). Commentators 
have argued that “the broad grant of patent 
protection for methods of doing business is 
something of a square peg in a sinkhole of uncertain 
dimensions” since “[n]owhere in the substantial 
literature on innovation is there a statement that 
the United States economy suffers from a lack of 
innovation in methods of doing business.” Raskind, 
supra at 92-93. Instead, “the long history of U.S. 
business is one of innovation, emulation, and innovation 
again. It also is a history of remarkable 
creativity and success, all without business method 
patents until the past few years.” Smith, supra at 
178; see also Sfekas, supra at 213 (“While innovation 
in business methods is a good thing, it is likely 
that there would be the same level of innovation 
even without patents on [such methods].”). 

Business innovations, by their very nature, 
provide a competitive advantage and thus generate 
their own incentives. See Xiang, supra at 813 (“A 
business entity improves the way it does business in 
order to be more effective and efficient, to stay 
ahead of [the] competition, and to make more 
profit.”). The rapid “growth of fast food restaurants, 
self-service gasoline stations, quick oil change facilities 
... automatic teller devices ... and alternat


ives for long-distance telephone services” casts real 
doubt about the need for the additional incentive of 
patent protection in the commercial realm. Raskind, 
supra at 93. 

Although patents are not a prerequisite to business 
innovation, they are of undeniable importance 
in promoting technological advances. For example, 
the pharmaceutical*1006 industry relies on patent 
protection in order to recoup the large sums it invests 
to develop life-saving and life-enhancing 
drugs: 

[T]he “fully loaded” cost of developing a single 
new pharmaceutical molecule, taking it though 
laboratory and clinical trials, and securing FDA 
approval for its marketing is today about $800 
million (including the cost of project failures). 
Furthermore, fewer than one in five drug candidates 
that make it out of the laboratory survive this 
tortuous process and reach the marketplace in the 
form of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.... Only 
patent protection can make the innovator's substantial 
investment in development and clinical 
testing economically rational. 

Jay Dratler, Jr., Alice in Wonderland Meets the 

U.S. Patent System, 38 Akron L.Rev. 299, 313-14 
(2005) (footnotes omitted). 
Business method patents, unlike those granted 
for pharmaceuticals and other products, offer rewards 
that are grossly disproportionate to the costs 
of innovation. In contrast to technological endeavors, 
business innovations frequently involve 
little or no investment in research and development. 
Bilski, for example, likely spent only nominal sums 
to develop his hedging method. The reward he 
could reap if his application were allowed-exclusive 
rights over methods of managing risks in a wide 
array of commodity transactions-vastly exceeds any 
costs he might have incurred in devising his 
“invention.”

and useful Arts,’ the constitutional objective 
of patent and copyright protection.” Lab. Corp. of 
Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., 548 U.S.

(Breyer, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ., dissenting 
from dismissal of writ of certiorari) 
(emphasis in original). This is particularly true in 
the context of patents on methods of conducting 
business. Instead of providing incentives to competitors 
to develop improved business techniques, 
business method patents remove building blocks of 
commercial innovation from the public domain. 
Dreyfuss, supra at 275-77. Because they restrict 
competitors from using and improving upon patented 
business methods, such patents stifle innovation. 
When “we grant rights to exclude unnecessarily, 
we ... limit competition with no quid pro quo. 
Retarding competition retards further development.” 
Pollack, supra at 76. “Think how the airline 
industry might now be structured if the first company 
to offer frequent flyer miles had enjoyed the 
sole right to award them or how differently mergers 
and acquisitions would be financed ... if the use of 
junk bonds had been protected by a patent.” Dreyfuss, 
supra at 264. By affording patent protection to 
business practices, “the government distorts the operation 
of the free market system and reduces the 
gains from the operation of the market.” Sfekas, 
supra at 214. 

It is often consumers who suffer when business 
methods are patented. See Raskind, supra at 82. 
Patented products are more expensive because licensing 
fees are often passed on to consumers. See 
Lois Matelan, The Continuing Controversy Over 
Business Method Patents, 18 Fordham Intell. Prop. 
Med. & Ent. L.J. 189, 201 (2007). Further, as a 
general matter, “quantity and quality [of patented 
products] are less than they would be in a competitive 
market.” Dreyfuss, supra at 275. 

*1007 Patenting business methods makes 
American companies less competitive in the global 
marketplace. American companies can now obtain 

exclusionary rights on methods of conducting business, 
but their counterparts in Europe and Japan 
generally cannot. See Biddinger, supra at 2546-47. 
Producing products in the United States becomes 
more expensive because American companies, unlike 
their overseas counterparts, must incur licensing 
fees in order to use patented business methods: 

[O]nce a United States patent application for a 
new method of doing business becomes publicly 
available, companies in Europe and Japan may 
begin using the method outside the United States, 
while American companies in competition with 
the patentee would be unable to use the method 
in the United States without incurring licensing 
fees. The result is that companies outside of the 
United States receive the benefit of the novel 
method without incurring either the research and 
development costs of the inventor, or the licensing 
fees of the patentee's American competitors. 

Id. at 2545-46. 

C. 
Another significant problem that plagues business 
method patents is that they tend to be of poor 
overall quality. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, 
L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 397, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 
L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) (Kennedy, J., joined by 
Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., concurring) 
(noting the “potential vagueness and suspect validity” 
of some of “the burgeoning number of patents 
over business methods”). Commentators have 
lamented “the frequency with which the Patent Office 
issues patents on shockingly mundane business 
inventions.” Dreyfuss, supra at 268; see also Pollack, 
supra at 106 (“[M]any of the recently-issued 
business method patents are facially (even farcically) 
obvious to persons outside the USPTO.”). One 
reason for the poor quality of business method patents 
is the lack of readily accessible prior art references. 
Because business methods were not patentable 
prior to State Street, “there is very little patent-
related prior art readily at hand to the examiner 
corps.” Dreyfuss, supra at 269.

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

Furthermore, information about methods of 
conducting business, unlike information about technological 
endeavors, is often not documented or 
published in scholarly journals. See Russell A. 
Korn, Is Legislation the Answer? An Analysis of the 
Proposed Legislation for Business Method Patents, 
29 Fla. St. U.L.Rev. 1367, 1372-73 (2002). The fact 
that examiners lack the resources to weed out undeserving 
applications “has led to the improper approval 
of a large number of patents, leaving private 
parties to clean up the mess through litigation.” 
Krause, supra at 97. 

Allowing patents to issue on business methods 
shifts critical resources away from promoting and 
protecting truly useful technological advances. As 
discussed previously, the patent office has been deluged 
with business method applications in recent 
years. Time spent on such applications is time not 
spent on applications which claim true innovations. 
When already overburdened examiners are forced 
to devote significant time to reviewing large numbers 
of business method applications, the public's 
access to new and beneficial technologies is unjustifiably 
delayed. 

D. 
Patenting business methods allows private 
parties to claim exclusive ownership of ideas and 
practices which rightfully belong in the public domain. 
“It is a matter of public interest that 
[economic] decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent 
and well *1008 informed. To this end, the free 
flow of commercial information is indispensable.” 
Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens 
Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 765, 96 
S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976). Thus, “the 
stringent requirements for patent protection seek to 
assure that ideas in the public domain remain there 
for the free use of the public.” Aronson v. Quick 
Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262, 99 S.Ct. 1096, 
59 L.Ed.2d 296 (1979). 

Bilski's claimed method consists essentially of 
two conversations. The first conversation is 
between a commodity provider and a commodity 

consumer, while the second conversation is 
between the provider and “market participants” 
who have “a counter-risk position to ... consumers.” 
His claims provide almost no details as to the contents 
of these conversations. 

Like many business method applications, Bilski's 
application is very broadly drafted. It covers a 
wide range of means for “hedging” in commodity 
transactions. If his application were allowed, anyone 
who discussed ways to balance market risks in 
any sort of commodity could face potential infringement 
liability. By adopting overly expansive 
standards for patentability, the government enables 
private parties to impose broad and unwarranted 
burdens on speech and the free flow of ideas. See 
Thomas F. Cotter, A Burkean Perspective on Patent 
Eligibility, 22 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 855, 880-82 
(2007) (arguing that overly expansive patent eligibility 
standards can result in the granting of patents 
that threaten free speech, privacy and other constitutionally-
protected rights); John R. Thomas, The 
Future of Patent Law: Liberty and Property in the 
Patent Law, 39 Hous. L.Rev. 569, 589 (2002) 
(arguing that “the patent law allows private actors 
to impose more significant restraints on speech than 
has ever been possible through copyright”); see 
also Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. 
Comm'n of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 569-70, 100 
S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980) (The First 
Amendment mandates that restrictions on free 
speech in commercial transactions be “no more extensive 
than necessary.”). 

To the extent that business methods are deemed 
patentable, individuals can face unexpected potential 
infringement liability for everyday conversations 
and commercial interactions. “[I]mplicit in the 
Patent Clause itself [is the understanding] that free 
exploitation of ideas will be the rule, to which the 
protection of a federal patent is the exception.”

V. 
The majority's proposed 
“machine-or-transformation test” for patentability 
will do little to stem the growth of patents on non-
technological methods and ideas. Quite simply, in 
the context of business method patent applications, 
the majority's proposed standard can be too easily 
circumvented. See Cotter, supra at 875 (noting that 
the physical transformation test for patentability 
can be problematic because “[i]n a material universe, 
every process will cause some sort of physical 
transformation, if only at the microscopic level 
or within the human body, including the brain”). 
Through clever draftsmanship, nearly every process 
claim can be rewritten to include a physical transformation. 
Bilski, for example, could simply add a 
requirement that a commodity consumer install a 
meter to record commodity consumption. He could 
then argue that installation*1009 of this meter was 
a “physical transformation,” sufficient to satisfy the 
majority's proposed patentability test. 

Even as written, Bilski's claim arguably involves 
a physical transformation. Prior to utilizing 
Bilski's method, commodity providers and commodity 
consumers are not involved in transactions 
to buy and sell a commodity at a fixed rate. By using 
Bilski's claimed method, however, providers 
and consumers enter into a series of transactions allowing 
them to buy and sell a particular commodity 
at a particular price. Entering into a transaction is a 
physical process: telephone calls are made, meetings 
are held, and market participants must physically 
execute contracts. Market participants go from 
a state of not being in a commodity transaction to a 
state of being in such a transaction. The majority, 
however, fails to explain how this sort of physical 
transformation is insufficient to satisfy its proposed 
patent eligibility standard. 

The majority suggests that a technological arts 
test is nothing more that a “shortcut” for its machine-
or-transformation test. Ante at 964. To the 

contrary, however, the two tests are fundamentally 
different. Consider U.S. Patent No. 7,261,652, 
which is directed to a method of putting a golf ball, 

U.S. Patent No. 6,368,227, which is directed to a 
method of swinging on a swing suspended on a tree 
branch, and U.S. Patent No. 5,443,036, which is 
directed to a method of “inducing cats to exercise.” 
Each of these “inventions” involves a physical 
transformation that is central to the claimed method: 
the golfer's stroke is changed, a person on a 
swing starts swinging, and the sedentary cat becomes 
a fit feline. Thus, under the majority's approach, 
each of these inventions is patent eligible. 
Under a technological arts test, however, none of 
these inventions is eligible for patent protection because 
none involves any advance in science or techFN9


nology.

FN9. The majority's approach will encourage 
rent-seeking on a broad range of human 
thought and behavior. For example, 
because organizing a country into a democratic 
or socialist regime clearly involves a 
physical transformation, what is to prevent 
patents from issuing on forms of government? 


Regardless of whether a claimed process involves 
a “physical transformation,” it should not be 
patent eligible unless it is directed to an advance in 
science or technology. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 
64-71, 93 S.Ct. 253 (finding a process unpatentable 
even though it “transformed” binary-coded decimals 
into pure binary numbers using a general purpose 
computer). Although the Supreme Court has 
stated that a patentable process will usually involve 
a transformation of physical matter, see id. at 70, 93 
S.Ct. 253, it has never found a process patent eligible 
which did not involve a scientific or technological 
innovation. See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 192-93, 
101 S.Ct. 1048 (finding a process patentable where 
it involved new technology for curing rubber). 

The majority refuses to inject a technology requirement 
into the section 101 analysis because it 
believes that the terms “technological arts” and

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

“technology” are “ambiguous.” See ante at 960. To 
the contrary, however, the meaning of these terms 
is not particularly difficult to grasp. “The need to 
apply some sort of ‘technological arts' criterion has 
hardly led other countries' and regions' patent systems 
to grind to a halt; it is hard to see why it 
should be an insurmountable obstacle for ours.” 
Cotter, supra at 885. As discussed more fully in 
section III, a claimed process is technological to the 
extent it applies laws of nature to new ends. See 
Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253 (“ ‘If there is 
to be invention from ... a discovery, it *1010 must 
come from the application of the law of nature to a 
new and useful end.’ ” (quoting Funk Bros., 333 

U.S. at 130, 68 S.Ct. 440)). By contrast, a process 
is non-technological where its inventive concept is 
the application of principles drawn not from the 
natural sciences but from disciplines such as business, 
law, sociology, or psychology. See Thomas 
(1999), supra at 1168 (“[F]ew of us would suppose 
that inventions within the domain of business, law 
or fine arts constitute technology, much less patentable 
technology.”). The inventive aspect of Bilski's 
claimed process is the application of business 
principles, not laws of nature; it is therefore non-
technological and ineligible for patent protection. 
Unlike a technological standard for patentability, 
the majority's proposed test will be exceedingly 
difficult to apply. The standard that the majority 
proposes for inclusion in the patentability lexicon“
transformation of any physical object or substance, 
or an electronic signal representative of any physical 
object or substance,” ante at 964-is unnecessarily 
complex and will only lead to further uncertainty 
regarding the scope of patentable subject matter. As 
noted in In re Nuijten, 500 F.3d 1346, 1353 
(Fed.Cir.2007), defining the term “physical” can be 
an “esoteric and metaphysical” inquiry. Indeed, although 
this court has struggled for years to set out 
what constitutes sufficient physical transformation 
to render a process patentable, we have yet to 
provide a consistent or satisfactory resolution of 
this issue. 

We took this case en banc in a long-overdue effort 
to resolve primal questions on the metes and 
bounds of statutory subject matter. The patent system 
has run amok, and the USPTO, as well as the 
larger patent community, has actively sought guidance 
from this court in making sense of our section 
101 jurisprudence. See Supplemental Br. of Appellee 
at 3 (“[The Federal Circuit] should clarify 
the meaning of State Street and AT & T, as they 
have been too often misunderstood.”); Br. of Fin. 
Serv. Indus. at 1 (“The rise of [business method 
patents] in recent years has ... led to uncertainty 
over the scope of the patents granted and, more fundamentally, 
the definition of patentable subject 
matter itself. [We] seek a workable standard defining 
the scope of patentable subject matter, one that 
... provides clear guidance to the Patent and Trademark 
Office ... and the public.”); Br. of Samuelson 
Law, Tech. and Public Policy Clinic at 1 (“Ever 
since State Street, the [USPTO] has been flooded 
with applications for a wide variety of non-
technological ‘inventions' such as arbitration methods, 
dating methods, tax-planning methods, legal 
methods, and novel-writing methods. These applications 
have eroded public confidence in the patent 
system and driven up the cost and decreased the return 
for applicants seeking legitimate technological 
patents.” (footnote omitted)); Br. of Assoc. of Am. 
Medical Colleges at 29 (arguing that “broad swaths 
of the public and certain industry sectors” have lost 
respect for the patent system and that “[the Federal 
Circuit] should act, even if its actions mean unsettling 
the settled expectations of some”). The majority, 
however, fails to enlighten three of the thorniest 
issues in the patentability thicket: (1) the continued 
viability of business method patents, (2) what constitutes 
sufficient physical transformation or machine-
implementation to render a process patentable, 
and (3) the extent to which computer software 
and computer-implemented processes constitute 
statutory subject matter. The majority's 
“measured approach” to the section 101 analysis, 
see ante at 962, will do little to restore public confidence 
in the patent system or stem the growth of 
patents on *1011 business methods and other non

technological ideas. 

VI. 
Where the advance over the prior art on which 
the applicant relies to make his invention patentable 
is an advance in a field of endeavor such as law 
(like the arbitration method in Comiskey ), business 
(like the method claimed by Bilski) or other liberal-
as opposed to technological-arts, the application 
falls outside the ambit of patentable subject matter. 
The time is ripe to repudiate State Street and to recalibrate 
the standards for patent eligibility, thereby 
ensuring that the patent system can fulfill its constitutional 
mandate to protect and promote truly useful 
innovations in science and technology. I dissent 
from the majority's failure to do so. 

RADER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

This court labors for page after page, paragraph 
after paragraph, explanation after explanation to 
say what could have been said in a single sentence: 
“Because Bilski claims merely an abstract idea, this 
court affirms the Board's rejection.” If the only 
problem of this vast judicial tome were its circuitous 
path, I would not dissent, but this venture also 
disrupts settled and wise principles of law. 

Much of the court's difficulty lies in its reliance 
on dicta taken out of context from numerous Supreme 
Court opinions dealing with the technology 
of the past. In other words, as innovators seek the 
path to the next tech no-revolution, this court ties 
our patent system to dicta from an industrial age 
decades removed from the bleeding edge. A direct 
reading of the Supreme Court's principles and cases 
on patent eligibility would yield the one-sentence 
resolution suggested above. Because this court, 
however, links patent eligibility to the age of iron 
and steel at a time of subatomic particles and terabytes, 
I must respectfully dissent. 

I 

The Patent Law of the United States has always 
embodied the philosophy that “ingenuity should receive 
a liberal encouragement.” Writings of 
Thomas Jefferson 75-76 (Washington ed. 1871); 

see also Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 
308-09, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980). 
True to this principle, the original Act made “ any 
new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition 
of matter” patent eligible. Act of Feb. 21, 
1793, ch. 11, § 1, 1 Stat. 318 (emphasis supplied). 
Even as the laws have evolved, that bedrock principle 
remains at their foundation. Thus, the Patent 
Act from its inception focused patentability on the 
specific characteristics of the claimed invention-its 
novelty and utility-not on its particular subject matter 
category. 

The modern incarnation of section 101 holds 
fast to that principle, setting forth the broad categories 
of patent eligible subject matter, and conditioning 
patentability on the characteristics, not the 
category, of the claimed invention: 

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful 
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of 
matter, or any new and useful improvement 
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to 
the conditions and requirements of this title. 

35 U.S.C. § 101 (2006) (emphases supplied). 
As I have suggested, the Supreme Court requires 
this court to rely on the “ordinary, contemporary, 
common meaning” of these words. Diamond v. 
Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 
L.Ed.2d 155 (1981). If this court would follow that 
Supreme Court rule, it would afford broad patent 
protection to new and *1012 useful inventions that 
fall within the enumerated categories and satisfy 
the other conditions of patentability. That is, after 
all, precisely what the statute says. 

In Diehr, the Supreme Court adopted a very 
useful algorithm for determining patentable subject 
matter, namely, follow the Patent Act itself. After 
setting forth the procedural history of that case, the 
Supreme Court stated: “In cases of statutory construction, 
we begin with the language of the statute.” 
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048. With 
an eye to the Benson language (so central to this 
court's reasoning) that “[t]ransformation and reduc

Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 72, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d

than once cautioned that “courts ‘should not read 
into the patent laws limitations and conditions 
which the legislature has not expressed.’ ” 

Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048 
(citations omitted). Indeed section 101's term 
“process” contains no hint of an exclusion for certain 
types of methods. This court today nonetheless 
holds that a process is eligible only if it falls within 
certain subsets of “process.” Ironically the Patent 
Act itself specifically defines “process” without any 
of these judicial innovations. 35 U.S.C. § 100(b). 
Therefore, as Diehr commands, this court should 
refrain from creating new circuitous judge-made 
tests. 

Read in context, section 101 gives further reasons 
for interpretation without innovation. Specifically, 
section 101 itself distinguishes patent eligibility 
from the conditions of patentability-providing 
generously for patent eligibility, but noting that patentability 
requires substantially more. The language 
sweeps in “any new and useful process ... [and] any 
improvement.” 35 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis supplied). 
As an expansive modifier, “any” embraces 
the broad and ordinary meanings of the term 
“process,” for instance. The language of section 
101 conveys no implication that the Act extends 
patent protection to some subcategories of processes 
but not others. It does not mean “some” or 
even “most,” but all. 

Unlike the laws of other nations that include 
broad exclusions to eligible subject matter, such as 
European restrictions on software and other method 
patents, see European Patent Convention of 1973, 
Art. 52(2)(c) and (3), and prohibitions against patents 
deemed contrary to the public morality, see id. 
at Art. 53(a), U.S. law and policy have embraced 

advances without regard to their subject matter. 
That promise of protection, in turn, fuels the research 
that, at least for now, makes this nation the 
world's innovation leader. 

II 

With all of its legal sophistry, the court's new 
test for eligibility today does not answer the most 
fundamental question of all: why would the expansive 
language of section 101 preclude protection of 
innovation simply because it is not transformational 
or properly linked to a machine (whatever that 
means)? Stated even more simply, why should 
some categories of invention deserve no protection? 

This court, which reads the fine print of Supreme 
Court decisions from the Industrial Age with 
admirable precision, misses the real import of those 
decisions. The Supreme Court has answered the 
fundamental question above many times. The Supreme 
Court has counseled that the only limits on 
eligibility are inventions that embrace natural laws, 
natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. See, e.g., 
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 185, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (“This 
Court *1013 has undoubtedly recognized limits to § 
101 and every discovery is not embraced within the 
statutory terms. Excluded from such patent protection 
are laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract 
ideas.”). In Diehr, the Supreme Court's last 
pronouncement on eligibility for “processes,” the 
Court said directly that its only exclusions from the 
statutory language are these three common law exclusions: 
“Our recent holdings ... stand for no more 
than these long-established principles.” Id. at 185, 
101 S.Ct. 1048. 

This point deserves repetition. The Supreme 
Court stated that all of the transformation and machine 
linkage explanations simply restated the abstractness 
rule. In reading Diehr to suggest a non-
statutory transformation or preemption test, this 
court ignores the Court's admonition that all of its 
recent holdings do no more than restate the natural 
laws and abstractness exclusions. Id.; see also

new bacterium with markedly different characteristics 
from any found in nature and one having the potential 
for significant utility. His discovery is not 
nature's handiwork, but his own; accordingly it is 
patentable subject matter under § 101.”); Parker v. 
Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 591-594, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 
L.Ed.2d 451 (1978) (“Even though a phenomenon 
of nature or mathematical formula may be well 
known, an inventive application of the principle 
may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such 
a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there 
is some other inventive concept in its application.”); 
In re Taner, 681 F.2d 787, 791 (C.C.P.A 
1982) (“In Diehr, the Supreme Court made clear 
that Benson stands for no more than the long-
established principle that laws of nature, natural 
phenomena, and abstract ideas are excluded from 
patent protection.”). 

The abstractness and natural law preclusions 
not only make sense, they explain the purpose of 
the expansive language of section 101. Natural laws 
and phenomena can never qualify for patent protection 
because they cannot be invented at all. After 
all, God or Allah or Jahveh or Vishnu or the Great 
Spirit provided these laws and phenomena as humanity's 
common heritage. Furthermore, abstract 
ideas can never qualify for patent protection because 
the Act intends, as section 101 explains, to 
provide “useful” technology. An abstract idea must 
be applied to (transformed into) a practical use before 
it qualifies for protection. The fine print of Supreme 
Court opinions conveys nothing more than 
these basic principles. Yet this court expands 
(transforms?) some Supreme Court language into 
rules that defy the Supreme Court's own rule. 

When considering the eligibility of 
“processes,” this court should focus on the potential 
for an abstract claim. Such an abstract claim would 
appear in a form that is not even susceptible to examination 
against prior art under the traditional 
tests for patentability. Thus this court would wish 
to ensure that the claim supplied some concrete, 
tangible technology for examination. Indeed the 

hedging claim at stake in this appeal is a classic example 
of abstractness. Bilski's method for hedging 
risk in commodities trading is either a vague economic 
concept or obvious on its face. Hedging is a 
fundamental economic practice long prevalent in 
our system of commerce and taught in any introductory 
finance class. In any event, this facially abstract 
claim does not warrant the creation of new 
eligibility exclusions. 

III 

This court's willingness to venture away from 
the statute follows on the heels of an *1014 oft-
discussed dissent from the Supreme Court's dismissal 
of its grant of certiorari in Lab. Corp. of Am. 
Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., 548 U.S. 124, 
126 S.Ct. 2921, 165 L.Ed.2d 399 (2006). That dissent 
is premised on a fundamental misapprehension 
of the distinction between a natural phenomenon 
and a patentable process. 

The distinction between “phenomena of 
nature,” “mental processes,” and “abstract intellectual 
concepts” is not difficult to draw. The fundamental 
error in that Lab. Corp. dissent is its failure 
to recognize the difference between a patent ineligible 
relationship-i.e., that between high homocysteine 
levels and folate and cobalamin deficiencies-
and a patent eligible process for applying that 
relationship to achieve a useful, tangible, and concrete 
result-i.e., diagnosis of potentially fatal conditions 
in patients. Nothing abstract here. Moreover, 
testing blood for a dangerous condition is not a natural 
phenomenon, but a human invention. 

The distinction is simple but critical: A patient 
may suffer from the unpatentable phenomenon of 
nature, namely high homocysteine levels and low 
folate. But the invention does not attempt to claim 
that natural phenomenon. Instead the patent claims 
a process for assaying a patient's blood and then 
analyzing the results with a new process that detects 
the life-threatening condition. Moreover, the 
sick patient does not practice the patented invention. 
Instead the patent covers a process for testing 
blood that produces a useful, concrete, and tangible

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943) 

result: incontrovertible diagnostic evidence to save 
lives. The patent does not claim the patent ineligible 
relationship between folate and homocysteine, 
nor does it foreclose future inventors from 
using that relationship to devise better or different 
processes. Contrary to the language of the dissent, 
it is the sick patient who “embod[ies] only the correlation 
between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency,” 
Lab. Corp., 548 U.S. at 137, 126 S.Ct. 
2921, not the claimed process. 

From the standpoint of policy, the Lab. Corp. 
dissent avoids the same fundamental question that 
the Federal Circuit does not ask or answer today: Is 
this entire field of subject matter undeserving of incentives 
for invention? If so, why? In the context of 
Lab. Corp. that question is very telling: the natural 
condition diagnosed by the invention is debilitating 
and even deadly. See U.S. Patent No. 4,940,658, 
col. 1, ll. 32-40 (“Accurate and early diagnosis of 
cobalamin and folate deficiencies ... is important 
because these deficiencies can lead to life-
threatening hematologic abnormalities.... Accurate 
and early diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency is especially 
important because it can also lead to incapacitating 
and life-threatening neuropsychiatric abnormalities.”). 
Before the invention featured in 
Lab. Corp., medical science lacked an affordable, 
reliable, and fast means to detect this debilitating 
condition. Denial of patent protection for this innovation-
precisely because of its elegance and simplicity 
(the chief aims of all good science)-would 
undermine and discourage future research for diagnostic 
tools. Put another way, does not Patent Law 
wish to encourage researchers to find simple blood 
tests or urine tests that predict and diagnose breast 
cancers or immunodeficiency diseases? In that context, 
this court might profitably ask whether its decisions 
incentivize research for cures and other important 
technical advances. Without such attention, 
this court inadvertently advises investors that they 
should divert their unprotectable investments away 
from discovery of “scientific relationships” within 
the body that diagnose breast cancer or Lou 
Gehrig's disease or Parkinson's or whatever. 

*1015 IV 

In sum, this court today invents several circuitous 
and unnecessary tests. It should have merely 
noted that Bilski attempts to patent an abstract idea. 
Nothing more was needed. Instead this opinion 
propagates unanswerable questions: What form or 
amount of “transformation” suffices? When is a 
“representative” of a physical object sufficiently 
linked to that object to satisfy the transformation 
test? (e.g., Does only vital sign data taken directly 
from a patient qualify, or can population data derived 
in part from statistics and extrapolation be 
used?) What link to a machine is sufficient to invoke 
the “or machine” prong? Are the “specific” 
machines of Benson required, or can a general purpose 
computer qualify? What constitutes 
“extra-solution activity?” If a process may meet eligibility 
muster as a “machine,” why does the Act 
“require” a machine link for a “process” to show 
eligibility? Does the rule against redundancy itself 
suggest an inadequacy in this complex spider web 
of tests supposedly “required” by the language of 
section 101? 

One final point, reading section 101 as it is 
written will not permit a flurry of frivolous and useless 
inventions. Even beyond the exclusion for abstractness, 
the final clause of section 101-“subject 
to the conditions and requirements of this 
title”-ensures that a claimed invention must still 
satisfy the “conditions and requirements” set forth 
in the remainder title 35. Id. These statutory conditions 
and requirements better serve the function of 
screening out unpatentable inventions than some 
vague “transformation” or “proper machine link” 
test. 

In simple terms, the statute does not mention 
“transformations” or any of the other Industrial Age 
descriptions of subject matter categories that this 
court endows with inordinate importance today. 
The Act has not empowered the courts to impose 
limitations on patent eligible subject matter beyond 
the broad and ordinary meaning of the terms process, 
machine, manufacture, and composition of

matter. It has instead preserved the promise of patent 
protection for still unknown fields of invention. 

Innovation has moved beyond the brick and 
mortar world. Even this court's test, with its caveats 
and winding explanations seems to recognize this. 
Today's software transforms our lives without physical 
anchors. This court's test not only risks hobbling 
these advances, but precluding patent protection 
for tomorrow's technologies. “We still do not 
know one thousandth of one percent of what nature 
has revealed to us.” Attributed to Albert Einstein. If 
this court has its way, the Patent Act may not incentivize, 
but complicate, our search for the vast 
secrets of nature. When all else fails, consult the 
statute.

Background: Patent owner brought action against competitor 
alleging infringement of its patents relating to 
extended release formulations of clarithromycin. The 
United States District Court for the Northern District of 
Illinois, David H. Coar, J., 500 F.Supp.2d 807, granted 
owner's motion for preliminary injunction, and denied 
competitor's motion for stay of injunction pending appeal, 
500 F.Supp.2d 846. Competitor appealed. 

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit 
Judge, held that: 

(1) finding of inequitable conduct was not appropriate; 
(2) patent owner had substantial likelihood of success 
on merits of claim that its patents were not likely to be 
held unenforceable based on inequitable conduct; 
(3) owner had substantial likelihood of success on merits 
of claim that its patents were infringed; 
(4) owner would likely suffer irreparable harm by market 
share and revenue loss upon competitor's entry into 
the market in absence of preliminary injunction; 
(5) balance of hardships favored preliminary injunction; 
and 
(6) public interest supported grant of preliminary injunction.

BACKGROUND 

This suit concerns two Abbott Laboratories patents 
on extended release formulations of the antibiotic drug 
clarithromycin, sold by Abbott with the brand name Biaxin
®XL. The patent on clarithromycin itself expired in 
2005; only extended release formulations are at issue. 
The purpose of the extended release formulation is to 

extend the period of drug effectiveness after ingestion 
and thereby to reduce the requisite frequency of dosage. 
Sandoz filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application 
(ANDA) for its extended release formulation of clarithromycin; 
the Food and Drug Administration approved 
the ANDA on August 25, 2005, and on September 16, 
2005 Abbott filed suit in the United States District 
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charging San-
doz with infringement of United States Patent No. 
6,010,718 (the '718 patent) and Patent No. 6,551,616 
(the '616 patent). Abbott also charged infringement 
*1344 of Patent No. 6,872,407, but has withdrawn this 
patent from suit. 

The '718 patent claims an extended release pharmaceutical 
composition comprising an erythromycin 
derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, 
whereby after ingestion certain specified parameters of 
drug bioavailability are met. Claims 1, 4, and 6 of the ' 
718 patent are in suit: 

1. A pharmaceutical composition for extended release 
of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal 
environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative 
and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer, so that when ingested 
orally, the composition induces statistically significantly 
lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma 
than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin 
derivative while maintaining bioavailability 
substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release 
composition of the erythromycin derivative. 
4. A pharmaceutical composition for extended release 
of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal 
environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative 
and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer, so that upon oral ingestion, 
maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin 
derivative are lower than those produced by an 
immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and 
area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum 
plasma concentrations are substantially equivalent 
to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical 
composition.

6. An extended release pharmaceutical composition 
comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer, the composition having 
an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate 
release formulation. 
The '616 patent is a continuation-in-part of the '718 
patent, with claims directed to the method of reducing 
gastrointestinal side effects. Claim 2 is in suit, shown 
with claim 1 from which it depends: 

1. A method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side 
effects comprising administering an effective amount 
of extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising 
an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer. 
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin. 
In response to the charge of infringement Sandoz 
presented the defenses of invalidity based on anticipation 
and obviousness, unenforceability based on inequitable 
conduct, and noninfringement. This appeal is from 
the district court's grant of Abbott's motion for a preliminary 
injunction, preserving the status quo during the 
pendency of this litigation. Sandoz challenges the district 
court's rulings on all issues. 

I 

VALIDITY ISSUES 

The district court reviewed the factors relevant to 
the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, viz., (1) 
likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation, 
(2) whether irreparable harm is likely if the injunction 
is not granted, (3) the balance of hardships as 
between the litigants, and (4) factors of the public interest. 
See Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int'l, 316 F.3d 
1331, 1338-39 (Fed.Cir.2003); H.H. Robertson Co. v. 
United Steel Deck, Inc., 820 F.2d 384, 387-88 
(Fed.Cir.1987). At the stage of the preliminary injunction, 
before the issues of fact and law have been fully 
explored and finally resolved, “[t]he *1345 purpose of a 
preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative 
positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be 
held.” University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 
395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981). 

On appellate review of the grant of a preliminary 
injunction, the question “is simply whether the issuance 
of the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion.” 
Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 932, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 
45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975). “It is well settled that the granting 
of a temporary injunction, pending final hearing, is 
within the sound discretion of the trial court; and that, 
upon appeal, an order granting such an injunction will 
not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity, 
or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion.” 
Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U.S. 
282, 290, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940). Abuse of 
discretion is established “by showing that the court 
made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant 
factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of 
law or clearly erroneous factual findings.” Novo Nordisk 
of North America, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 77 F.3d 
1364, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1996). See Cybor Corp. v. FAS 
Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1460 (Fed.Cir.1998) 
(en banc ) (“A district court abuses its discretion when 
its decision is based on clearly erroneous findings of 
fact, is based on erroneous interpretations of the law, or 
is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or fanciful.”). 

Sandoz assigns legal error to the district court's rulings 
that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of 
validity, infringement, and inequitable conduct, and 
states that the district court abused its discretion in balancing 
the equities and granting the injunction. 

Anticipation 

“Anticipation” in patent usage means that the 
claimed invention was previously known and described 
in a printed publication, explicitly or inherently. Anticipation 
is established by documentary evidence, and 
requires that every claim element and limitation is set 
forth in a single prior art reference, in the same form 
and order as in the claim. See In re Omeprazole Patent 
Litigation, 483 F.3d 1364, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2007); Continental 
Can Co. v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264, 1267 
(Fed.Cir.1991). An anticipating reference must enable 
that which it is asserted to anticipate. Omeprazole, 483 
F.3d at 1378 (“To ‘anticipate,’ the identical subject matter 
must not only be previously known, but the knowledge 
must be sufficiently enabling to place the inform

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

ation in the possession of the public.”); Elan Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. v. Mayo Found. for Medical Educ. & Research, 
346 F.3d 1051, 1054 (Fed.Cir.2003) (same). 

Sandoz argued that the '718 patent is anticipated by 
European Patent Publication No. 0,280,571 B1 (the '571 
Publication), which describes “a sustained release matrix 
formulation in tablet form comprising from 0.1% by 
weight to 90% by weight of an antimicrobial agent selected 
from ... erythromycin ... from 5% by weight to 
29% by weight of a hydrophilic polymer, and from 
0.5% by weight to 25% by weight of an acrylic polymer....” 
The '571 Publication states that hydrophilic 
polymers such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 
(HPMC) can be used to form a hydrophilic matrix 
which “respond[s] to increases in pH with a corresponding 
increase in the permeability of the dosage form.” 
Sandoz argued in the district court that although the 
'571 Publication does not mention clarithromycin or the 
specific pharmacokinetic limitations in the '718 patent 
claims, the '571 Publication anticipates the '718 claims 
because clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative 
and the claimed pharmacokinetic limitations are inherent 
in the extended release compositions of the '571 
Publication. Sandoz also argued that enablement *1346 
of the compositions in the '571 Publication must be presumed, 
because the compositions in the '718 patent are 
presumed to be enabled and, according to Sandoz, are 
identical. 

Abbott responded that the '571 Publication cannot 
“anticipate” because it does not show the elements of 
the claims of issue; it does not mention clarithromycin, 
it does not disclose the pharmacokinetic criteria stated 
in the '718 claims, and it does not enable these limitations, 
either expressly or inherently. Abbott argued that 
significant experimentation would be required to ascertain 
the applicability of any release agent from the large 
number of release agents mentioned in the '571 Publication, 
particularly as applied to a different biological 
product having different dissolution and metabolic characteristics. 
Thus Abbott argued that the legal criteria of 
“anticipation” are not met by the '571 Publication. 

The district court found that Sandoz did not present 
evidence sufficient to support its argument that “the 

'571 Publication's teachings would enable Abbott to create 
an extended release of an erythromycin derivative 
drug simply based on the structural limitations.” Abbott, 
500 F.Supp.2d at 840. The district court observed that 
the '571 Publication “does not offer any in vivo dissolution 
data” nor state “the pharmacokinetic profile of its 
own formulations.” Id. The court concluded that Sandoz 
would not be likely to succeed in establishing anticipation 
by this reference. We discern no clear error in this 
conclusion, for the '571 Publication neither describes 
the product of the '718 claims nor enables the pharmacokinetic 
properties that are set forth in the '718 claims. 
See Elan Pharmaceuticals, 346 F.3d at 1057 (an anticipating 
reference must disclose every element of the 
claims, and place a person of ordinary skill in possession 
of the claimed invention). 

Obviousness 

Sandoz also argued that the claims of the '781 and ' 
616 patents are invalid on the ground of obviousness, in 
view of the combination of the '571 Publication with 
PCT Application WO 95/30422 (the PCT or '422 Application) 
and United States Patent No. 5,705,190 (the 
'190 patent). 

In determining, for preliminary injunction purposes, 
the likelihood that patent invalidity would be established 
at trial, the district court evaluates the factual and 
legal arguments in light of the presumptions and burdens 
that will inhere at trial, viz., that “[a] patent shall 
be presumed valid.... The burden of establishing invalidity 
of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the 
party asserting such invalidity.” 35 U.S.C. § 282. This 
burden “exists at every stage of the litigation.” Canon 
Computer Systems, Inc. v. Nu-Kote Int'l, Inc., 134 F.3d 
1085, 1088 (Fed.Cir.1998); see Sanofi-Synthelabo v. 
Apotex, Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006) 
(taking into account the applicable presumptions and 
burdens in reviewing the grant of a preliminary injunction). 
Sandoz on this appeal relies on the Supreme 
Court's decision in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex, 
Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 
(2007), Sandoz arguing that the law of obviousness has 
been significantly changed, and that the district court 
did not give adequate recognition to the changed law.

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

The district court had issued its initial decision granting 
the preliminary injunction shortly before the Court's decision 
in KSR. The court then requested supplemental 
briefing and argument, and issued a further opinion discussing 
the issues in light of KSR and continuing to 
conclude that Abbott was likely to prevail on the merits 
of the question of obviousness. 

In its initial decision the district court discussed the 
references in detail. The *1347 court explained that the 
PCT Application, entitled “Controlled-Release Dosage 
Forms of Azithromycin,” describes “[a] dosage form for 
oral administration comprising azithromycin and a pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier, which releases not 
more than about 10% of its incorporated azithromycin 
into a mammal's stomach, and which releases not more 
than an additional 10% during the first 15 minutes after 
entering said mammal's duodenum,” and exhibits decreased 
gastrointestinal side effects. The district court 
explained that the PCT Application shows hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 
(HPMC) and other polymers as “a 
hydrophilic polymer sufficient to provide a useful degree 
of control over the azithromycin dissolution,” and 
contains in vitro data showing the amount and timing of 
dissolution of azithromycin in various conditions and 
sustained dosage forms. 

Sandoz argued that these teachings should be combined 
with those of the '571 Publication and the '190 
patent entitled “Controlled Release Formulation for 
Poorly Soluble Basic Drugs,” which describes a 
“controlled release solid pharmaceutical composition 
adapted for oral administration comprising: a therapeutically 
effective amount of at least one basic drug having 
a water solubility of less than 1 part per 30 parts water 
... wherein the basic drug is a macrolide” and as the release 
agent a water-soluble alginate salt. The '190 patent 
names the macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, 
azithromycin, roxithromycin, and ABT229 
for use with the alginate salt release agent. Sandoz 
argued that the subject matter of the '718 patent would 
have been obvious in view of the ' 571 Publication 
showing extended release formulations of erythromycin 
derivatives, in combination with the controlled release 
formulations and pharmacokinetic properties of azith


romycin in the PCT Application, and the modified release 
alginate salt formulation of clarithromycin in the ' 
190 patent. Sandoz argued that a person of ordinary 
skill in this field would have desired to improve the administration 
of clarithromycin by finding an extended 
release formulation having optimum release and biological 
properties, and would have selected and tested the 
HPMC from the '571 Publication, in view of the formulation 
of azithromycin with HPMC in the PCT Application 
and the '190 patent's use of an alginate salt to modify 
the release of clarithromycin. Sandoz stressed that 
the PCT Application states the known principle of using 
controlled release formulations to reduce the dosing frequency 
for short half-life compounds. Sandoz argued 
that no more than routine experimentation was needed 
to find a controlled release formulation that would meet 
the pharmacokinetic requirements stated in the '718 
claims. 

Sandoz applied similar arguments to the claims of 
the '616 patent, stating that the PCT Application teaches 
that control of azithromycin release reduces 
gastrointestinal side effects, and that the '190 patent 
shows the interchangeability of azithromycin and clarithromycin 
in the formulation using an alginate salt. San-
doz argued that this combination of references renders 
obvious a clarithromycin formulation with reduced 
gastrointestinal side effects as claimed in the '616 patent 
. In its supplemental argument based on KSR, Sandoz 
argued that Abbott merely “pursue[d] known options” 
for both the '718 and '616 patents, based on the Court's 
exposition that: “When there is a design need or market 
pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number 
of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary 
skill has good reason to pursue the known options 
within his or her technical grasp.” KSR, 127 S.Ct. 
at 1742. 

In the district court Abbott disputed the premises 
presented by Sandoz, challenged *1348 the analysis of 
the content and significance of the references, and argued 
that KSR did not hold, as Sandoz proposed, that 
the recognition of a problem of itself renders the solution 
obvious. Abbott argued that more is needed than recognizing 
the problem, as this court discussed in Cardi

ac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., 381 F.3d 
1371, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2004) (“Recognition of a need does 
not render obvious the achievement that meets that 
need.... Recognition of an unsolved problem does not 
render the solution obvious.”) Abbott pointed out that 
the Court qualified its discussion by explaining that the 
“problem” should have “a finite number of identified, 
predictable solutions,” KSR, 127 S.Ct. at 1742, to expose 
its eventual solution to unpatentability as “obvious 
to try.” Id. Abbott stressed the difference between new 
biological compositions whose performance and effectiveness 
in combination cannot be confidently predicted 
but must be made and evaluated, and new mechanical 
combinations of known elements each of which predictably 
performs its known function in the combination. 

Abbott stressed that its choice of extended release components 
is not shown or suggested by the prior art to 
produce the pharmacokinetic properties of Abbott's 
claims. The Court recognized in Dennison Mfg. Co. v. 
Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 106 S.Ct. 1578, 89 
L.Ed.2d 817 (1986) that the district court is not to rely 
on hindsight, and that “in addressing the question of obviousness 
a judge must not pick and choose isolated elements 
from the prior art and combine them so as to 
yield the invention in question if such a combination 
would not have been obvious at the time of the invention.” 
475 U.S. at 810, 106 S.Ct. 1578. In Graham v. 
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 
545 (1966) the Court recognized that the obviousness 
inquiry must “guard against slipping into use of hindsight 
and to resist the temptation to read into the prior 
art the teachings of the invention in issue.” Id. at 36, 86 
S.Ct. 684. 

Abbott agreed that the basic principles of pharmacokinetics 
were known, but argued that the limitations in the 
'718 claims, whereby the bioavailability of the product 
was characterized, were not shown as achieved in any 
reference or any combination of references. Abbott 
pointed out that the PCT Application is directed specifically 
to azithromycin and shows “scores” of possible 

formulations, all using in vitro data, and does not contemplate 
metabolite activity in vivo as is manifested for 
chlorithromycin. Abbott stated that “the '422 publication 
discloses more than a dozen possible classes of delivery 
devices,” Abbott Brief at 42, that “the '422 publication 
merely provides in vitro dissolution data for a 
subset of its disclosed compositions,” and that the formulation 
in the PCT Application “did not even have 
equivalent bioavailability as IR [immediate release] azithromycin.” 
Id. at 41, 86 S.Ct. 684. 

Abbott described in the '718 and '616 specifications that 
the '190 patent reference presents “C values [that] 

max 

are not statistically significantly different from those of 
the IR formulation.” '718 patent, col. 2, lines 11-12; ' 
616 patent, col. 2, lines 13-14 (referring to Ser. No. 
08/574,877, the '190 patent). Abbott stated that Sandoz 
concedes that the '190 patent does not describe pharmacokinetic 
limitations based on clarithromycin 
plasma concentrations, and that neither the PCT Application 
nor the '190 patent discloses the pharmacokinetic 
limitations and properties set forth in the '718 and 
'616 claims, and that neither the PCT Application nor 
any other reference provides guidance as to which formulation 
would provide the pharmacokinetic characteristics 
required by the '718 claims. 

Thus Abbott argued in the district court that a skilled artisan 
would not have known the effect of substituting 
*1349clarithromycin for azithromycin in any specific 
formulation that might be selected from the PCT Application, 
for it is undisputed that there are significant 
differences among erythromycin derivatives. Abbott 
presented evidence to the district court that azithromycin 
and clarithromycin exhibit different properties in 
four biological processes of relevance to oral drug administration: 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion. These differences were tabulated by Abbott's 
expert, Professor Stanley S. Davis, as follows:

Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Davis, February 7, 
2007. The parties do not dispute that the PCT Application 
describes only in vitro data, and that in vitro data 
are not predictably transferable to in vivo conditions. 
Dr. Davis testified that “it simply isn't the case that in 
vitro controlled release data will automatically correlate 
with the pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo, and in 
fact, for many of the formulations of the '422 application, 
they affirmatively do not so correlate.” Id. 

The district court concluded that a person of ordinary 
skill in this field would not have predicted which 
formulation, that might be selected from the prior art, 
would provide the required pharmacokinetics. The district 
court referred to the dissimilarities in the pharmacokinetic 
properties for azithromycin as shown in the 
PCT Application, considered the content of the ' 190 
patent, and concluded that the bioavailability of the formulations 
claimed in the '718 patent were not predictable 
from these references. The court referred to the 
testimony of another Abbott expert, Dr. Daniel Weiner, 
that “the '190 patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-
specific PK [ pharmacokinetic] data” or “any DFL 

FN2

[degree of fluctuation] values at all.” Declaration 
of Daniel Weiner, Ph.D., January 9, 2007. Dr. Weiner 
explained that the pK values reported in the '190 patent 
are based on total antibiotic activity, which consists of 
the combined concentrations of clarithromycin and its 
active metabolite, while the pharmacokinetic elements 
of the '718 patent relate specifically to clarithromycin 
plasma concentrations. Dr. Weiner concluded, and the 
district court agreed, that a skilled artisan would not 
have had a reasonable expectation of producing effective 
compositions based on the mention of clarithromy


cin along with azithromycin in the '190 patent, because 
of their different mechanisms of antibiotic activity and 
the effect of this activity on pharmacokinetic behavior. 

FN2. The variation between maximum and 
minimum concentration is measured by the degree 
of fluctuation, called “DFL”, calculated as 
(C-C)/CwithC theaverage 

max minavg, avg

concentration over a dosing interval. Appx. 463 
¶ 1128. 

The district court observed that the in vivo azithromycin 
controlled release formulations in the PCT Application 
have less total bioavailability than their immediate 
release counterparts, supporting Abbott's argument 
that the behavior of differing biological systems, even 
when structurally similar, is not predictable. See Alza 
Corp. v. Mylan Laboratories, 464 F.3d 1286, 1297 
(Fed.Cir.2006) (“Alza's evidence of in vitro dissolution 
*1350 rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating 
that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo 
behavior.”). The district court concluded that the in vivo 
extended release properties claimed in the '718 patent 
are sufficiently dissimilar to or unpredictable from the 
in vitro controlled release data for azithromycin in the 
PCT Application that a person of ordinary skill in the 
field of the invention would not have had the degree of 
confidence of success in transferring the PCT Application's 
azithromycin formulation to the different metabolic 
and solubility systems of clarithromycin as would 
render the '718 claimed invention unpatentable on the 
ground of obviousness. 

In reaching these conclusions, the district court relied 
on the Federal Circuit's decision on the same pat

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

ents in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 473 F.3d 1196 (Fed.Cir.2007) (herein “ Andrx ”). 
This court, sustaining the district court's grant of a preliminary 
injunction, had concluded that obviousness 
was not likely to be established, reversing this court's 
prior ruling reversing the grant of a preliminary injunction 
in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 452 F.3d 1331 (Fed.Cir.2006) (herein “ Teva ”). 
Sandoz argued to the district court that the Federal Cir-
cuit's ruling in Andrx is incorrect, and on this appeal 
Sandoz urges us to reject Andrx and reinstate Teva. 

In Teva a panel of this court held that the claims of 
the '718 patent were likely to be held not infringed. This 
court also stated that there was a substantial likelihood 
that claim 4 of the '718 patent would be held invalid for 
obviousness based on the PCT Application together 
with the '190 patent. This court held that the preliminary 
injunction should be denied, although the panel cautioned 
that its ruling “in no way resolves the ultimate 
question of invalidity.” Teva, 452 F.3d at 1347. In Andrx 
a later panel of this court, on an enlarged record, rejected 
the invalidity ruling in Teva and held that the 
'718 claims were likely to withstand the attack on validity. 
Andrx, 473 F.3d at 1203-07. 

Reviewing this history as applied to Sandoz' arguments 
herein, the district court explained that this court 
in Teva had not been made aware of the differences 
between the pharmacokinetic criteria described in the ' 
190 patent and those of the '718 patent. The district 
court explained that the pharmacokinetic data in the ' 
190 patent were based on measurements of total antibiotic 
activity in the body, which includes both clarithromycin 
and its active metabolite formed after ingestion, 
whereas the data in the '718 patent are specific to clarithromycin 
alone. The court found that “Abbott has 
shown...thatthePKprofileoftheclarithromycin-metabolite 
data of the '190 patent formulation was not the same 
as the PK profile of the clarithromycin-only data utilized 
by the '718 patent,” Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 841. 

Sandoz argued, in its supplemental briefing in the 
district court after the KSR decision, that this court's decision 
in Andrx does not survive scrutiny under the principles 
set forth in KSR, and stressed that application of 

KSR renders it “obvious to try” the various release 
agents in the PCT Application, such that any successful 
composition would be unpatentable, whether or not the 
results were predictable. Sandoz argued that the '190 
patent shows that clarithromycin and azithromycin have 
similarities as well as differences, and that it would be 
obvious to experiment to determine which formulations 
were effective in view of these differences and similarities. 
Sandoz stressed that the Abbott scientists had 
knowledge of the prior art including the PCT Application, 
and that they developed the Abbott formulation in 
only one month of research effort. Sandoz quoted the 
Court's admonition in KSR that a *1351 court “can take 
account of the inferences and creative steps that a person 
of ordinary skill in the art would employ,” 127 S.Ct. 
at 1741, and that “[t]he combination of familiar elements 
according to known methods is likely to be obvious 
when it does no more than yield predictable results.” 
Id. at 1739. 

The district court, applying KSR, reconsidered its 
prior determination and framed the question as 
“whether an ordinary person skilled in the art would 
have seen a benefit to combining an erythromycin derivative 
with a polymer with the same PK [ pharmacokinetic] 
limitations as embodied in claims 1 and 4 of 
the '718 patent given the state of the pharmaceutical 
industry at the time.” Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 851. The 
court concluded: “Based upon what evidence and argument 
Sandoz offered, the answer was and remains no.” 
Id. The district court explained that “this Court's preliminary 
factual findings ... found that Sandoz had not produced 
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were 
disclosed in the prior art or were inherent to the structural 
limitations of the prior art compositions.” Id. at 

852. The district court observed that “[t]he KSR opinion 
only focused on the Federal Circuit's strict use of the 
TSM [teaching, suggestion, motivation] test in performing 
the obviousness analysis; it did not mention or affect 
the requirement that each and every claim limitation 
be found present in the combination of the prior art 
references before the analysis proceeds.” Id. at 852. 
We agree that the obviousness of selection of components, 
when there is no prediction in the prior art as

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

to the results obtainable from a selected component, differs 
from the issue in KSR, where the Court provided 
guidance that “a court must ask whether the improvement 
is more than the predictable use of prior art elements 
according to their established functions.” 127 
S.Ct. at 1740. The Court explained the conditions in 
which “obvious to try” may negate patentability, depending 
on the relation of the prior art teaching to the 
later-developed technology. The Court explained that 
when the problem is known, the possible approaches to 
solving the problem are known and finite, and the solution 
is predictable through use of a known option, then 
the pursuit of the known option may be obvious even 
absent a “teaching, suggestion, or motivation” concerning 
that option. Then, “if this leads to the anticipated 
success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of 
ordinary skill and common sense.” 127 S.Ct. at 1742. 

Abbott argued that the “known options” in the prior 
art were not “finite, identified, and predictable,” the 
words of KSR, and are identified only with hindsight 
knowledge of Abbott's new formulation and its pharmacokinetic 
properties. Abbott pointed to the discussion in 
the PCT Application of over a dozen possible drug delivery 
modes, including matrix systems, membrane-
moderated or reservoir systems, osmotic pumps, coated 
hydrogel tablets and multi particulates, sustained release 
compositions with delayed-release layers, pH-dependent 
coated tablets, bursting osmotic core devices, bursting 
coated swelling core devices, pH-triggered bursting osmotic 
core devices, pH-triggered bursting coated swelling 
core devices, enzyme-triggered supported liquid 
membrane devices, bacterially degradable coating 
devices, and swelling plug devices, all classes of controlled 
release for drug delivery systems, each containing 
sub-classes and variations. PCT App. at 8-38. The 
expert witnesses pointed out the difficulties in predicting 
the behavior of any composition in any specific biological 
system. 

The evaluation of the choices made by a skilled scientist, 
when such choices lead to the desired result, is a 
challenge to judicial *1352 understanding of how technical 
advance is achieved in the particular field of science 
or technology. Such understanding is critical to ju


dicial implementation of the national policy embodied 
in the patent statute. In Publication of Tomlinson, 53 

C.C.P.A. 1421, 363 F.2d 928 (1966) our predecessor 
court discussed the role of “obvious to try” in scientific 
and technologic research and in patentability: 
Slight reflection suggests, we think, that there is usually 
an element of “obviousness to try” in any research 
endeavor, that is not undertaken with complete 
blindness but rather with some semblance of a chance 
of success, and that patentability determinations 
based on that as the test would not only be contrary to 
statute but result in a marked deterioration of the entire 
patent system as an incentive to invest in those efforts 
and attempts which go by the name of 
“research.” 

Id. at 931. The Court in KSR did not create a presumption 
that all experimentation in fields where there 
is already a background of useful knowledge is 
“obvious to try,” without considering the nature of the 
science or technology. The methodology of science and 
the advance of technology are founded on the investigator's 
educated application of what is known, to intelligent 
exploration of what is not known. Each case must 
be decided in its particular context, including the characteristics 
of the science or technology, its state of advance, 
the nature of the known choices, the specificity 
or generality of the prior art, and the predictability of 
results in the area of interest. 

The district court discussed the differences between 
the pharmacokinetic properties shown in the '190 patent 
reference and the properties in the ' 718 patent 
claims, the differences in the chemical and biological 
properties of azithromycin and clarithromycin, the differences 
between in vitro and in vivo data, and the differences 
between azithromycin and clarithromycin. For 
example, Abbott's expert Dr. Davis stated that “the absorption 
of clarithromycin is affected by a phenomenon 
know as the ‘first pass effect’ which does not occur for 
azithromycin,” and that azithromycin's “metabolism occurs 
only post-absorption.” Dr. Davis also stated that 
“the half-life for azithromycin is about 70 hours, whereas 
that for clarithromycin is about 3-4 hours at low IR 
doses.” First-pass metabolism was explained as mean

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

ing that a significant amount of the drug is metabolized 
and converted into another compound before it enters 
the circulation; Dr. Davis stated that a person of skill in 
this field, having this knowledge, would not have assumed 
that the two drugs would exhibit similar behavior 
if placed in the same formulation. The district court 
concluded that it was not predictable, from the in vitro 
behavior of azithromycin, how any specific clarithromycin 
extended release formulation would perform in 
vivo. 

Sandoz presented other arguments, for example, 
that the FDA regulations state the requirements for approval 
of extended release formulations, thereby rendering 
obvious a formulation that meets these requirements. 
However, knowledge of the goal does not render 
its achievement obvious. The district court appropriately 
applied the KSR standard of whether the patents 
in suit represented an “identified, predictable solution” 
and “anticipated success,” the words of KSR, to the 
problem of producing extended release formulations 
having the pharmacokinetic properties in the claims. 

On the record of the preliminary injunction proceedings, 
and considering this court's ruling in Andrx 
and the guidance of the Court in KSR, we do not discern 
reversible error in the district court's ruling that Abbott 
is likely to prevail on the *1353 issues of patent validity 
based on anticipation and obviousness. 

II 

INEQUITABLE CONDUCT 

Sandoz also argued that the '718 and '616 patents 
are unenforceable due to Abbott's “inequitable conduct” 
in the Patent and Trademark Office. Sandoz stated that 
Abbott submitted a false declaration to the PTO, and 
also that Abbott withheld from the examiner the results 
of certain tests after the patent applications were filed 
and that were inconsistent with information in the patent 
applications. The district court found that there was 
no intent to deceive the examiner, and that the criticized 
activity did not constitute inequitable conduct. 

[1][2] The evidentiary standard for determining 
whether there was inequitable conduct in obtaining a 
patent that is otherwise valid was set forth by this court, 

sitting en banc for the purpose, in Kingsdown Medical 
Consultants, Ltd. v. Hollister Inc., 863 F.2d 867 
(Fed.Cir.1988). The court explained that “[t]o be guilty 
of inequitable conduct, one must have intended to act 
inequitably,” and held: “Inequitable conduct resides in 
failure to disclose material information, or submission 
of false material information, with an intent to deceive, 
and those two elements, materiality and intent, must be 
proven by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. at 872. 
Mistake or negligence, even gross negligence, does not 
support a ruling of inequitable conduct. The court held: 

We adopt the view that a finding that particular conduct 
amounts to “gross negligence” does not of itself 
justify an inference of intent to deceive; the involved 
conduct, viewed in light of all the evidence, including 
evidence indicative of good faith, must indicate sufficient 
culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive. 


Id. at 876. When both materiality and deceptive intent 
have been established the district court determines, 
in the court's discretion, whether inequitable conduct 
has occurred; appellate review is on this basis. See id. at 
876 (“As an equitable issue, inequitable conduct is committed 
to the discretion of the trial court and is reviewed 
by this court under an abuse of discretion standard. We, 
accordingly, will not simply substitute our judgment for 
that of the trial court in relation to inequitable conduct.”). 


The '718 patent 

[3] Sandoz first challenges the district court's findings 
with respect to a declaration by an inventor, Dr. 
Linda Gustavson, comparing the products of the 
pending '718 application with the products in a prior art 
Abbott patent, U.S. Patent No. 4,808,411, directed to a 
pediatric clarithromycin suspension that is administered 
twice daily. Dr. Gustavson submitted data to the PTO 
comparing the '718 and the '411 formulations, and 
stated that “the ER [extended release] formulation as 
claimed, is supported by the above results, namely, C 
of clarithromycin in plasma is statistically signific


max 

antly lower than that for IR [immediate release] formulation 
given twice daily.” The declaration also stated 
that “AUC is maintained over 24 hours; and Cis

min

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

substantially equivalent to that of the IR suspension”.

FN3 

However, in this litigation Dr. Gustavson testified 
that she had not analyzed statistical significance, and 
that “it could not definitively be concluded from the 
data that the difference between the ER C and the C 

max 

for a twice-a-day dosed suspension would have 

max 

*1354 been statistically significantly different.” Based 
on this admission, Sandoz argued that the Gustavson 
submission to the PTO was a material misrepresentation, 
that intent to deceive is presumed, and that inequitable 
conduct was thereby established. 

FN3. The AUC is a calculation of the “area under 
a curve” when drug concentration is plotted 
over time, and is a measure of bioavailability 
of the drug. Cis the minimum rug concen


min 

tration over a dosing interval. 

Abbott did not dispute that Dr. Gustavson did not 
analyze statistical significance, but argued that it was 
not material to patentability and that a reasonable examiner 
would not have found otherwise. Abbott pointed 
out that the actual data were before the PTO, and that 
the results did show a numerically lower Cvalue. 

max 

Sandoz pointed out to the district court that Abbott's 
patent attorney argued nonobviousness to the PTO 
based on the Gustavson declaration, and Abbott responded 
that the declaration correctly stated that the pharmacokinetic 
properties of the product in the '411 patent 
are markedly different from those of the product of 
the '718 patent. We have been directed to no evidence 
of deceptive intent, or “bad faith or intentional misconduct”, 
in the words of PTO Rule 56; on this appeal San-
doz repeats that deceptive intent should be inferred 
from the misstatement. 

The district court cited Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis 
Pharm., Inc., 468 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006) for 
its summary that a ruling of inequitable conduct requires 
clear and convincing evidence that the applicant 
while prosecuting the patent “(1) made an affirmative 
misrepresentation of material fact, failed to disclose material 
information, or submitted false material information, 
and (2) intended to deceive the [PTO].” In determining 
materiality, the district court applied the standard 
that “[u]ndisclosed information is material if it satisfies 

37 C.F.R. § 1.56 and if there is a substantial likelihood 
that a reasonable examiner would have considered the 
undisclosed information important in deciding whether 
to allow the patent to issue.” Although the Federal Circuit 
has not always been consistent in defining 
“materiality” in accordance with the PTO Rules, the 
principles are consistently directed to deceptive actions 
by patent applicants. In Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles 
Machine Works, 437 F.3d 1309 (Fed.Cir.2006) the court 
observed that four separate tests have been applied for 
materiality. 

The district court, applying the tests of materiality 
to the Gustavson statement about statistical significance, 
stated that it was “obviously troublesome that 
Gustavson made her assertion without having actually 
performed the statistical test.” The district court concluded 
that the Gustavson statement was not material to 
patentability, “despite the fact that it satisfies the definition 
of ‘material’ provided by 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(b).” The 
court stated that: 

Since 1) no claim of the '718 patent requires the extended 
release formulation to have a statistically significant 
lower Cmax than the immediate release formulation; 
2) the data in fact shows the Cmax of the 
extended release formulation to be lower (albeit not 
statistically significantly lower) than the Cmax of the 
immediate release formulation; and 3) the extended 
release formulation was in fact pharmacokinetically 
different from the immediate release suspension formulation, 
it is more likely than not that the PTO 
would not have found the “statistically significantly 
lower” statement to be important. 

500 F.Supp.2d at 822. Relevant is the ruling in Regents 
of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 
1559, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1997) (that “Information is material 
if a reasonable examiner would have considered it 
important to the patentability of a claim”). 

The district court also found that there was no evidence 
of intent to deceive the examiner. The court rejected 
Sandoz's argument that deceptive intent is inferred 
*1355 from materiality alone, for precedent requires independent 
proof of deceptive intent. See Kingsdown,

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

863 F.2d at 872 (intent to deceive the examiner into 
granting the patent is a separate and essential element of 
inequitable conduct in the PTO); Baker Oil Tools, Inc. 

v. Geo Vann, Inc., 828 F.2d 1558, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1987) 
(“The material facts upon which a holding of inequitable 
conduct rests relate to both the intent of the actor 
and the materiality of the information.”). Weighing the 
materiality of the statement and the absence of evidence 
of intent to deceive, we do not discern an abuse of discretion 
in the district court's conclusion that inequitable 
conduct was not established by the statement concerning 
statistical significance. 

Sandoz next challenged the fact that Abbott did not 
provide to the patent examiner the results of some clinical 
tests conducted after the '718 patent application was 
filed, that were reported to the FDA and included on the 
Biaxin ® XL product label. The test results relate to 

FN4

taste perversion results in a later clinical trial, and 
a study comparing clarithromycin with azithromycin. 
Sandoz stated that Abbott should have provided the patent 
examiners with these results and the product label, 
which report tests wherein the immediate release formulation 
has a lower incidence of taste perversion than the 
extended release formulation, contrary to the information 
in the '718 patent. Sandoz argued that the inventors 
knew or should have known of this discrepancy, and 
thus that intent to deceive is established. Abbott responded 
that the challenged taste tests were from dosages 
that were not directly comparable, and that they did not 
change the correctness of the data in the patent application. 
Abbott presented the expert testimony of Dr. Davis 
that “the comparison between the taste perversion incidence 
rate for Biaxin® IR and Biaxin® XL in the label 
does not relate to the invention disclosed and claimed in 
the '407 patent, which is for a reduction in taste perversion 
for the same total dose.” Supplemental Declaration 
of Professor Stanley S. Davis, February 7, 
2007(emphases in original). 

FN4. “Taste perversion” is defined in the '718 
patent as “the perception of a bitter metallic 
taste normally associated with erythromycin 
derivatives, particularly, with clarithromycin.” 
Col. 3, lines 53-55. 

[4] The district court concluded that the taste results 
met the materiality criteria of Rule 56 but that a 
reasonable examiner would not consider the information 
important in deciding whether to grant the patent. The 
court explained that a reasonable examiner would compare 
data at comparable dosages, and that the data were 
not comparable. Although Abbott and Sandoz argued 
about whether the inventors knew or should have 
known of this discrepancy between this taste data from 
the Phase III clinical trial, and the taste data in the patent 
application, the district court observed that there 
was no evidence of deliberate withholding of this information 
in order to deceive the patent examiner. 
“Intent to deceive can not be inferred solely from the 
fact that information was not disclosed; there must be a 
factual basis for a finding of deceptive intent.” Hebert 
v. Lisle Corp., 99 F.3d 1109, 1115, 1116 (Fed.Cir.1996) 
(“To establish inequitable conduct the information that 
is known to the applicant and not provided to the PTO 
must be both material to patentability, and withheld in 
order to deceive or mislead the examiner.”); Molins 
PLC v. Textron, Inc., 48 F.3d 1172, 1181 
(Fed.Cir.1995) (“While intent to deceive the PTO may 
be found as a matter of inference from circumstantial 
evidence, circumstantial evidence cannot indicate 
merely gross negligence.”). 

*1356 [5] Materiality is not evidence of intent, 
which must be established as a separate factual element 
of a discretionary ruling of inequitable conduct. The 
district court finding that the factual premises of both 
materiality and intent to deceive were not established in 
connection with the taste data, did not abuse its discretion 
in declining to find inequitable conduct on this 
ground. 

Finally, Sandoz criticized Abbott's failure to 
provide the PTO with a study designated W98-268, 
done after the patent application was filed, which compared 
the pharmacokinetic values of clarithromycin 
upon administration under various conditions. The district 
court described the issue as: “Abbott claimed that 
the mean DFL values for a modified release version of 
clarithromycin claimed by a prior patent, the '190 patent 
, were substantially equal to the mean DFL values for

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

the immediate release version of clarithromycin” but 
“[t]he final report of Study W98-268 states that the 
modified release formulation exhibited a statistically 
significantly lower mean DFL than that for the immediate 
release formulation.” 500 F.Supp.2d at 823. Sandoz 
stated that Abbott committed inequitable conduct by 
failing to disclose these results to the PTO. 

Dr. Weiner stated in his January 9 Declaration that 
“the'190patentdoesnotdiscloseanyclarithromycin-specific 
PK data,” and “the '190 patent does not disclose any 
DFL values at all,” and explained that “subsequent studies 
conducted by Abbott indicate that the commercial 
embodiment of the invention of the '190 patent does not 
have a statistically significantly lower DFL than the IR 
formulation.... Before the present litigation, Abbott had 
conducted five crossover studies in which the pharmacokinetic 
parameters for clarithromycin (i.e., clarithromycin 
specifically, not clarithromycin combined with 
its metabolite) were measured for both the MR 
[modified release] and IR formulations: W95-914, 
W95-195, W95-197, W98-268 [the study that Sandoz 
accuses Abbott of withholding], and TAI-99-001.” The 
mean DFL values in Table VII in the '718 patent are 
based on Study W95-195. See Supplemental Declaration 
of Dr. Ronald Sawchuk, February 7, 2007 (“Table 
VII reflects data from a multiple dose study involving 
MR formulation and an IR formulation that was conducted 
in Germany in 1995. See Ex. 12, Study 
W95-195.”). The studies conducted before the '718 patent 
application was filed showed the data reported in the 
specification. 

Many details were explained to the district court, as 
to all the studies, their context, and their relationship. 
The district court found that “contrary to Sandoz's assertion, 
Study W98-268 does not demonstrate that the 
prior art MR formulation has the same PK properties as 
that claimed for the ER formulation. Therefore, Study 
W98-268 is not material to the patentability of the '718 
patent.” Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 824. The district court 
found that the '718 patent “speaks of the PK relationship 
of extended release and immediate release formulations, 
not of modified release and immediate release formulations 
.... [and] there is no evidence showing the DFL of 

the ER formulation to be anything but consistently statistically 
significantly lower than the DFL of the IR formulation.” 
Id. The district court found that the W98-268 
study was not material under either Rule 56 or the reasonable 
examiner standard. Clear error has not been 
shown in this finding. 

On the preliminary injunction record, the district 
court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Sandoz 
was not likely to succeed in establishing inequitable 
conduct in Abbott's prosecution of the '718 patent application. 
We agree with the district *1357 court that 
the scales do not “tilt towards finding inequitable conduct.” 
Id. at 829. 

The '616 patent 

[6] Sandoz argued that inequitable conduct as to the 
taste perversion claim in the '718 patent taints the '616 
patent because a taste perversion claim was included in 
the '616 application when it was filed, although that 
claim was cancelled before any PTO examination on the 
merits. The district court declined to hold the '616 patent 
unenforceable based on a withdrawn claim, citing 
37 C.F.R. § 1.56(a): 
Rule 56(a). The duty to disclose information exists 
with respect to each pending claim until the claim is 
cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application 
becomes abandoned. Information material to 
the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn 
from consideration need not be submitted if the 
information is not material to the patentability of any 
claim remaining under consideration in the application. 


The district court deemed it “wholly inequitable to 
hold a patent to be invalid for fraudulent conduct in the 
prosecution of a claim that was withdrawn before actual 
prosecution had even begun.” Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 

829. This court held in Scripps Clinic & Research 
Found. v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1583 
(Fed.Cir.1991) that “[a] reference that is material only 
to withdrawn claims can not be the basis of a holding of 
inequitable conduct.” Rule 56 is in accord. 
Sandoz also argued as to the '616 patent that Abbott

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

did not report to the PTO the results of clinical trials 
conducted before the continuation in-part ' 616 application 
was filed. Sandoz' expert Dr. Marcello Pagano, in 
his Declaration dated January 25, 2007, stated: “I have 
reviewed the bronchitis and sinusitis studies [and] the 
claims of the '616 patent for a method of reducing 
gastrointestinal adverse side effects are not supported 
by the data from those two clinical studies.” The results 
of these studies were provided to the FDA, but not to 
the PTO. Dr. Pagano stated: “Since neither the sinusitis 
nor the bronchitis studies produced favorable results to 
support a claimed reduction in gastrointestinal adverse 
side effects, Abbott had to manipulate its data and report 
the number of discontinuations due to gastrointestinal 
adverse side effects to the PTO ...” The district 
court found that the information from these clinical trials 
was not material to patentability, stating that: “it is 
clear from both Table VI and Table VIII [of the '616 
patent] that some data demonstrating no change in the 
subcategories of GI adverse side effects of abdominal 
pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence and 
nausea were in fact disclosed to the PTO.” Abbott, 500 
F.Supp.2d at 828. These findings have not been shown 
to be clearly erroneous. 

[7] There was no evidence of intent to deceive with 
respect to the results of these clinical trials. Materiality, 
even if found, does not establish intent. This is not a 
case of new information that affects the fundamental invention; 
this is a case of challenging every action or inaction 
of the “conduct” of patent solicitation, although 
patentability is unaffected. The purpose of Kingsdown 
was to bring patent practice into the mainstream of the 
law and administrative practice. The law severely punishes 
fraudulent practices, and the patent practice includes 
recognition that the inventor usually knows more 
about the field than does the “expert” patent examiner. 
However, routine actions that do not affect patentability 
and that are devoid of fraudulent intent are not subject 
to a different standard than other inquiries into fraudulent 
procurement. The Administrative Procedure Act 
governs patent examination, See Dickinson v. Zurko, 
527 U.S. 150, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 144 L.Ed.2d 143 (1999), 
*1358 and actions of patent examiners are reviewed 
with recognition of examiner expertise so well as recognition 
of the occasionally imperfect examination process. 
“It was to mitigate the ‘plague’ whereby every 
patentee's imperfections were promoted to ‘inequitable 
conduct’ that this court reaffirmed that both materiality 
and culpable intent must be established.” Allied Colloids, 
Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 64 F.3d 1570, 
1578 (Fed.Cir.1995). 

We conclude that the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in holding that the '718 and '616 patents were 
not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable 
conduct in obtaining the patents. 

III 

INFRINGEMENT 

[8][9] The first step in most infringement suits is 
the procedure called “claim construction,” where the 
scope of the claim is defined by the court. At the preliminary 
injunction stage the district court's claim construction 
is reviewed, as for other legal issues, for the 
likelihood of correctness of the ruling. This likelihood 
is based on the underlying facts as found at this stage of 
the proceedings, recognizing that “the burdens at the 
preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.” 
Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do 
Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 
L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006). 

For the patents here in suit, the issue of infringement 
was resolved, at this preliminary injunction stage, 
as a matter of claim construction. The dispositive question 
was whether the term “pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymer” is limited to the polymers named in the specification, 
or can include other pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymers. If so limited, it is likely that there would 
not be literal infringement; if not so limited, then literal 
infringement would be possible. (Infringement under 
the doctrine of equivalents was not addressed by the 
district court, although Sandoz argues the issue “in an 
abundance of caution.”). 

The meaning and scope of “pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymer” as used in these patents has been litigated 
in other cases, none of which had been finally decided, 
but some of which had been appealed to the Federal 
Circuit based on the grant of a preliminary injunc

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

tion. The district court now construed 
“pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” in accordance 
with the construction by the Federal Circuit in Andrx, 
supra. Sandoz argues on this appeal that the correct 
construction is that of the Federal Circuit's earlier decision 
in Teva, supra. Sandoz argues that because Teva 
was the earlier ruling, it could not be overturned by the 
later Andrx panel, citing Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney 
Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed.Cir.1988) (“Where 
there is a direct conflict [between Federal Circuit panels], 
the precedential decision is the first.”). 

Abbott responds that the decision in Andrx was 
properly followed by this district court, for in Teva the 
“construction” of “pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” 
was not at issue, and this court's comment thereon 
was dictum. The court in Andrx recognized the non-
binding nature of that comment in Teva. Indeed, the district 
court in Teva had stated that “[a]t this early stage 
of the proceedings, the parties have raised no issue as to 
claim construction”. Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., No. 05 C 1490, 2005 WL 
1323435, at *3, *4 (N.D.Ill. June 03, 2005) (Teva conceding 
literal infringement but challenging validity). 

The panel in Andrx decided the questions now 
raised by Sandoz concerning the “construction” of 
“pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” and the pharmacokinetic 
requirements in the claims. The Andrx panel 
also explained its departure from the *1359 panel decision 
in Teva. The district court herein, applying Andrx 
, held that a person of ordinary skill in this field would 
interpret “ pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” in 
terms of the following description in the '718 specification: 


“ Pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein, 
means those compounds, which are, within the scope 
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact 
with the tissues of humans and lower animals without 
undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the 
like, in keeping with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, 
and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy 
and prophylaxis of antimicrobial infections. 

'718 patent, col. 3 lines 40-47. The district court 

referred to the '718 specification's listing of pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymers, but applied the Andrx 
ruling that the polymers are not limited to those that are 
named in the following paragraph: 

The pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is a water-
soluble hydrophilic polymer selected from the group 
consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl 
cellulose, vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers, 
methacrylic acid copolymers, maleic anhydride/ 
methyl vinyl ether copolymers and derivatives and 
mixtures thereof. 

'718 patent, col. 3 line 65 to col. 4 line 4. The district 
court construed “ pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymer” as: 

[A]ny polymer, which within the scope of sound medical 
judgment is suitable for use in pharmaceutical 
compositions for use in contact with the tissues of humans 
and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, 
allergic response, and the like, in keeping with 
a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their 
intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of 
antimicrobial infections, and is capable of forming a 
matrix to extend drug release into the bloodstream. 
Such a “pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” must 
constitute 5 to 50% by weight of the product. 

Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 834. The district court, 
following Andrx, held that the usage “from the group 
consisting of” in the specification is not exclusive, as it 
would be in a Markush-form claim, and did not negate 
the broader description that is also contained in the specification, 
as quoted above. 

This aspect was debated in the district court, and 
again on this appeal. Sandoz argues that since 
“pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” is limited by the 
specification to water-soluble hydrophilic polymers, and 
that since the listed methacrylic acid copolymers are 
known to include water-insoluble as well as water-soluble 
polymers, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymer” must be construed to mean that the formulation 
cannot include any water-insoluble methacrylic 
acid or other polymer. The district court, receiving this 
argument, reasoned that “the existence of water-in

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

soluble polymers from the specifically-mentioned 
methacrylic acid co-polymer subset actually militates 
towards a broader construction urged by Abbott that 
would encompass water-insoluble methacrylic acid copolymers.” 
Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 834. Sandoz argues 
that this reasoning is flawed, and that this court in 
Andrx erred in rejecting this argument. However, we are 
not persuaded that the Andrx panel's ruling warrants rejection 
on this argument, for we agree with the district 
court that the fact that some methacrylic acid copolymers 
are water-insoluble does not require limiting 
“pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” to the named 
polymers. 

We conclude that the district court's claim construction, 
which is that of Andrx, is correct, and that the district 
court properly*1360 declined to follow Teva. San-
doz' argument that Teva was the correct construction 
and should be revived by the Federal Circuit is hard to 
square with Sandoz' statement to the district court that 
“a very important point to make here is Sandoz does not 
rely on the Federal Circuit opinion in the Teva case.... 
Sandoz agrees with Abbott.” Statement at the February 
12, 2007 preliminary injunction hearing, transcript at 
A11085. 

Sandoz further argues that the district court erred 
by using the word “matrix” in its definition of 
“pharmaceutically acceptable polymer,” quoted above, 
pointing out that this word does not appear in the claims 
or specification. However, claim construction often 
calls upon words other than those of the patent, lest the 
claim simply define itself. “Claim construction” is for 
the purpose of explaining and defining terms in the 
claims, and usually requires use of words other than the 
words that are being defined. See Multiform Desiccants, 
Inc. v. Medzam, Ltd., 133 F.3d 1473, 1477 
(Fed.Cir.1998) (claims are construed as an aid to the decision-
maker, by restating the claims in non-technical 
terms). 

Abbott's expert Dr. Davis had used the word 
“matrix” in his explanation of the technology of extended 
release. He explained that a “pharmaceutically acceptable 
polymer ... alone or in combination with other 
polymers, is capable of forming a matrix when mixed 

with the drug to control and extend drug release into the 
GI tract and thence to the bloodstream.” Declaration of 
Professor Davis, January 10, 2007. Sandoz does not dispute 
that this explanation comports with the description 
in the specification. Also, Abbott cites several scientific 
publications that use the word “matrix” in this context, 
and Sandoz does not argue that the word has a different 
meaning from that with which it was used by the district 
court. There is no ground for discarding the district 
court's claim construction based on the word “matrix.” 

Sandoz also argued that the claims must be construed 
so that the “pharmaceutically acceptable polymer” 
is the only release agent in the composition, argued 
that the presence of any other agent that affects release 
of the drug removes the composition from the 
scope of the '718 claims. Abbott pointed out that the 
claims use the conventional signal “comprising,” which 
means that other ingredients may be present in the composition, 
in addition to those explicitly set forth. See 
CIAS, Inc. v. Alliance Gaming Corp., 504 F.3d 1356, 
1360 (Fed.Cir.2007) (“In the patent claim context the 
term ‘comprising’ is well understood to mean 
‘including but not limited to’.”); Georgia-Pacific Corp. 

v. United States Gypsum Co., 195 F.3d 1322, 1327-28 
(Fed.Cir.1999) (“ ‘comprising’ ... is inclusive or open-
ended and does not exclude additional unrecited elements 
or method steps”). 
Sandoz argues that the district court's claim construction 
is incorrect because it ignores the distinction 
between “pharmaceutically acceptable polymers” and 
“pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.” We discern 
no support for this challenge. Abbott points out that the 
distinction between “polymer” and “excipient” lies in 
its role in the composition, as the patent states: “The 
compositions of the invention further comprise pharmaceutically 
acceptable excipients and/or fillers and 
extenders, such as lactose ...”. '718 patent, col. 4, lines 
21-23. We discern no flawed judicial understanding of 
the term “excipient.” 

Sandoz also argued that the components of its accused 
formulation are merely “excipients” in that they 
do not extend the release of the clarithromycin, while 
Abbott pointed out that Sandoz described its product to

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 19 

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

the FDA as “extended release.” *1361 Sandoz stated 
that the extension of release for its product is achieved 
not by the polymer that is present in its composition, 
but by other components. The district court considered 
the arguments concerning the role of the maltodextrin 
and the silicified microcrystalline cellulose in the San-
doz product. The court discussed the evidence of release 
rates and amounts released, including the information in 
Sandoz' approved ANDA, the comparative data presented 
by both sides, and various technical articles 
provided by both sides on the physical and chemical 
characteristics of the components of the Sandoz formulation. 
The court found that “Abbott has demonstrated a 
substantial likelihood that maltodextrin is a polymer 
that alone or in combination with other polymers, is 
capable of forming a matrix to extend drug release.” Abbott, 
500 F.Supp.2d at 837. 

Sandoz argues that the district court erred in its 
evaluation of the evidence, stating that Abbott did not 
show by direct testing that any of the polymers in the 
Sandoz product actually extends the release of clarithromycin. 
Sandoz argues that the district court erred in 
finding unpersuasive certain laboratory tests conducted 
by Sandoz to show that maltodextrin has no significant 
impact on the dissolution rate of clarithromycin. Abbott 
responds that the district court did not err, and that San-
doz must be deemed to have admitted that maltodextrin 
and silicified microcrystalline cellulose are polymers 
that, alone or in combination with other components, 
are capable of extending drug release. Abbott pointed 
out to the district court that the developer of the Sandoz 
formulation, Dr. Nirmal Mulye, in his patent application 
(U.S.2004/0224017 A1) entitled “Process for Preparing 
Sustained Release Tablets,” stated that “the present inventor 
has found that the addition of maltodextrin in effective 
amounts provides the desired release profile,” 
that “maltodextrin also tends to slow down the release 
of a medicament in a controlled release formulation[,]” 
and that “the maltodextrin used in the present invention 
is to counteract the accelerated rate of release of the 
drug ...” We have not been directed to clear error in the 
district court's findings on this question. 

Sandoz raises additional arguments, some discussed 

by the district court, and some newly presented on this 
appeal. All have been considered. We conclude that the 
district court's findings and rulings at this stage of the 
proceedings have not been shown to constitute reversible 
error. The ruling that Abbott had shown a reasonable 
likelihood of proving infringement is sustained. 

IV 

THE EQUITABLE FACTORS 

Sandoz states that the district court incorrectly resolved 
and weighed the equitable factors relevant to the 
grant of a preliminary injunction. Sandoz states that the 
factors of irreparable harm, the balance of harms, and 
the public interest, all weigh in its favor, and outweigh 
any finding that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues 
of validity or enforceability and infringement. The district 
court considered these factors, and explained its 
reasoning in exercising its discretion to grant the preliminary 
injunction. 

Irreparable Harm 

[10] Sandoz argued that any harm to Abbott is not 
irreparable, for damages are available for infringement, 
if the eventual final judgment is adverse to Sandoz. 
Sandoz pointed out that the generic producers Teva and 
Ranbaxy are already in this market, by settlement with 
Abbott, such that any price erosion due to generic competition 
is already occurring. The district court considered 
these relationships, and *1362 concluded that 
they do not negate the market share and revenue loss 
upon Sandoz' entry while the litigation proceeds. Precedent 
supports this conclusion. See, e.g., Purdue 
Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, 237 F.3d 
1359, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2001) (likelihood of price erosion 
and loss of market position are evidence of irreparable 
harm); Bio-Technology Gen. Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 
80 F.3d 1553, 1566 (Fed.Cir.1996) (loss of revenue, 
goodwill, and research and development support constitute 
irreparable harm); Polymer Technologies, Inc. v. 
Bridwell, 103 F.3d 970, 975-76 (Fed.Cir.1996) (loss of 
market opportunities cannot be quantified or adequately 
compensated, and is evidence of irreparable harm). 
The Balance of Hardships 

[11] The district court discussed and weighed the 
hardships argued by both parties, and found that the bal©

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 20 

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

ance of hardships tipped in favor of Abbott. The court 
found that preserving the status quo preserves the current 
market structure, recognizing that Abbott has licensed 
other generic producers. The district court concluded 
that “Abbott will lose much more if this Court 
did not enjoin Sandoz's infringing conduct than if the 
Court enjoins Sandoz and it is subsequently found that 
the '718 patent is invalid or unenforceable.” Abbott, 500 
F.Supp.2d at 845. 

We agree that the fact that a patentee has licensed 
others under its patents does not mean that unlicensed 
infringement must also be permitted while the patents 
are litigated. Precedent illustrates that when the patentee 
is simply interested in obtaining licenses, without itself 
engaging in commerce, equity may add weight to permitting 
infringing activity to continue during litigation, 
on the premise that the patentee is readily made whole 
if infringement is found. In this case the district court 
received Abbott's argument that it could not be made 
whole if it prevails in this litigation, for the added 
erosion of markets, customers, and prices, is rarely reversible. 
See Sanofi-Synthelabo, 470 F.3d at 1383 
(rejecting hardship claim of generic challenger whose 
“harms were almost entirely preventable' and were the 
result of its own calculated risk to launch its product 
prejudgment”). 

Clear error has not been shown in the district 
court's finding that the harm to Sandoz of delay in entering 
this market while this case is litigated, is outweighed 
by the harm to Abbott in view of the likelihood 
that Abbott will succeed in sustaining the validity and 
enforceability of its patents. 

The Public Interest 

[12] Sandoz argues that the public interest favors 
the availability of less expensive forms of successful 
medicines. The district court considered this argument, 
and stated: 
The Court recognizes the public interest in competition 
in the pharmaceutical market. It also recognizes, 
however, the public interest in creating beneficial and 
useful products and the cost involved in that process. 
To the extent that this Court has found a substantial 

likelihood that the '718 patent is valid and enforceable, 
there can be no serious argument that public interest 
is not best served by enforcing it. 

500 F.Supp.2d at 846. The district court appreciated 
that the public interest includes consideration of whether, 
by shifting market benefits to the infringer while litigation 
is pending for patents that are likely to withstand 
the attack, the incentive for discovery and development 
of new products is adversely affected. The statutory 
period of exclusivity reflects the congressional 
balance of interests, and warrants weight in considering 
the public interest. In Sanofi-Synthelabo, 470 F.3d at 
1383, this court referred to the significant*1363 “public 
interest in encouraging investment in drug development 
and protecting the exclusionary rights conveyed in valid 
pharmaceutical patents.” As the Court explained in 
Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 94 
S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974): “The patent laws 
promote this progress by offering a right of exclusion 
for a limited period as an incentive to inventors to risk 
the often enormous costs in terms of time, research, and 
development.” Id. at 480, 94 S.Ct. 1879. 

Sandoz states that the Court's recent decision in 
eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 126 
S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) negates any presumption 
of entitlement to an injunction upon a finding 
of likelihood that a patent will be sustained and found 
infringed. The district court did not apply such a presumption, 
but fully considered all of the legal and equitable 
factors. At the preliminary injunction stage, the 
legal and equitable factors may be of different weight 
when the patentee is itself engaged in commerce, as 
contrasted with a patentee that is seeking to license its 
patent to others. We need not resolve this aspect for all 
possible situations, for as between Abbott and Sandoz 
the district court objectively weighed the legal probabilities 
and the equities, and exercised its discretionary 
judgment as to the entirety of the cause. We have been 
shown no basis for believing that the district court abused 
its discretion. 

V 
THE INJUNCTION BOND 
Sandoz also appeals the amount of the injunction

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 21 

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

bond, which the district court set at $40 million. Sandoz 
provides no substance for appellate review of the 
amount of the bond, simply stating in its brief that it 
“presented [to the district court] at least colorable evidence 
that its losses from the injunction and recall would 
be $200 million,” but not describing the evidence or arguing 
its merits. Sandoz simply states that its proposed 
number should have been accepted, in the event that the 
$40 million is later shown to be inadequate. 

This aspect has not been presented in reviewable 
substance. On this appeal, abuse of discretion has been 
shown in the district court's setting of the terms of the 
injunction. See Russell v. Farley, 105 U.S. 433, 441, 26 
L.Ed. 1060 (1881) (the court's discretion in setting the 
terms of an injunction is rooted in equity). 

VI 

THE ISSUE OF CONFLICTING PRECEDENT 

The district court found the likelihood that the patentee 
would succeed on the merits and that the equities 
favored the patentee, and exercised its discretion to enjoin 
infringement during the litigation. The dissent 
states that the district court applied the incorrect standard, 
and that if the infringer “raises a substantial question 
concerning either infringement or validity,” diss. 
op. at 1371, it is an abuse of discretion to enjoin infringement 
pendente lite. The dissent quotes with approval 
a past panel statement that “In resisting a preliminary 
injunction, however, one need not make out a case 
of actual validity. Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary 
injunction stages, while validity is the issue at 
trial.” Id. Indeed, this court's precedent makes this statement, 
in direct conflict with other, earlier statements 
that the standard is not vulnerability, but likelihood of 
success on the merits. 

In response to the arguments expounded in the dissenting 
opinion, I summarize the law governing the 
grant of a preliminary injunction. The criteria relied on 
in *1364 the dissent are not the criteria of any other circuit, 
nor of the Supreme Court. The correct standard is 
not whether a substantial question has been raised, but 
whether the patentee is likely to succeed on the merits, 
upon application of the standards of proof that will prevail 
at trial. The question is not whether the patent is 

vulnerable; the question is who is likely to prevail in the 
end, considered with equitable factors that relate to 
whether the status quo should or should not be preserved 
while the trial is ongoing. The presentation of 
sufficient evidence to show the likelihood of prevailing 
on the merits is quite different from the presentation of 
substantial evidence to show vulnerability. 

Thus the evidence that favors the patent must be 
considered in deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction, 
as well as the evidence against the patent. The 
trial court then decides which side is likely ultimately to 
prevail. The dissent presents only the case against the 
patent, apparently on the theory that this is all that is 
needed to raise a “substantial question”. 

Indeed, a showing of a substantial question concerning 
validity or infringement can serve to avert judgment 
on the pleadings, or to avoid the grant of summary 
judgment, but it is not the same as showing likelihood 
of eventual success on the merits. The dissent recognizes 
that it is not the same and that it “requires less 
proof”, but errs in stating that this is sufficient to defeat 
the grant of a preliminary injunction. Precedent is clear 
that the standard is the likelihood of success of the 
plaintiff at trial, with recognition of the presumptions 
and burdens. See, e.g., Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings, 
Inc., 405 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2005); Ranbaxy 
Pharmaceuticals., Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 350 F.3d 
1235, 1239 (Fed.Cir.2003); Reebok Int'l Ltd. v. J. 
Baker, Inc., 32 F.3d 1552, 1555 (Fed.Cir.1994); Smith 
Int'l, Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co., 718 F.2d 1573, 1579 
(Fed.Cir.1983). 

Supreme Court precedent, every regional circuit, 
and controlling Federal Circuit precedent, apply to the 
preliminary injunction the combination of criteria that 
includes likelihood of success on the merits and equitable 
considerations. No other court has held that when 
the attacker has presented a “substantial question” on its 
side of the dispute-that is, more than a scintilla but less 
than a preponderance of evidence in support of its side-
no injunction pendente lite is available. Further, equitable 
factors are of particular significance at the preliminary 
stage, where the question is whether to change the 
position of the parties during the litigation. See Camen

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

isch, 451 U.S. at 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830 (the preliminary 
injunction preserves the position of the parties during 
the litigation). The dissent does not mention the equitable 
factors that were considered by the district court, as 
required by precedent; the dissent simply states that the 
injunction must be denied if the attacker has raised a 
substantial question. 

Supreme Court precedent is clear in stating that the 
same burdens and standards of proof apply in deciding 
the merits for preliminary injunction purposes, as in deciding 
the same questions upon full litigation. See, e.g., 
Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211 (placing the 
burdens of proof for showing likelihood of success at 
the preliminary injunction stage). The Court explained 
in Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, AK, 
480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 
(1987) that: “The standard for a preliminary injunction 
is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction 
with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood 
of success on the merits rather than actual success.” 


*1365 There is no reason why patent cases require 
unique treatment. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, 
L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641. 
394 (2006) (“[T]he decision whether to grant or deny 
injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of 
the district courts, and that such discretion must be exercised 
consistent with traditional principles of equity, 
in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed 
by such standards.”). The general criterion of likelihood 
of success on the merits, in the context of the equities of 
the particular case, are uniform throughout the regional 
circuits. All are consistent with the rulings of the Supreme 
Court, and, although the words vary, all refer to 
the likelihood of the eventual outcome, not whether a 
substantial question has been raised. In brief sampling, 
starting with the First Circuit, the court summarized the 
standard in Wine and Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
418 F.3d 36 (1st Cir.2005): 

The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood 
of success on the merits: if the moving party 
cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in 
his quest, the remaining factors become matter of 

idle curiosity. 

Id. at 46 (citation omitted). The referenced 
“four-part inquiry” is “(1) the likelihood of success on 
the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the 
movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of 
relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant 
if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the 
movant if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if 
any) of the court's ruling on the public interest.” Id.

The Second Circuit also applies the standard four 
factors. I cite a case that emphasized the equitable considerations; 
in Laureyssens v. Idea Group, Inc., 964 
F.2d 131, 135-36 (2nd Cir.1992) (emphasis in original) 
the court stated: “A party seeking a preliminary injunction 
must establish (1) irreparable injury and (2) a likelihood 
of success on the merits or a sufficiently serious 
question going to the merits and a balance of hardships 
tipping decidedly in the moving party's favor.” 

The Third Circuit also stated that the district court 
must consider four factors: “[A] the likelihood that the 
applicant will prevail on the merits at final hearing; [B] 
the extent to which the plaintiffs are being irreparably 
harmed by the conduct complained of; [C] the extent to 
which the defendants will suffer irreparable harm if the 
preliminary injunction is issued; and [D] the public interest.” 
Opticians Ass'n of Am. v. Independent Opticians 
of Am., 920 F.2d 187, 191-92 (3rd Cir.1990) (alterations

Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., 630 F.2d 120 
(3rd Cir.1980) the court explained that when analyzing 
a preliminary injunction: 

the moving party must generally show (1) a reasonable 
probability of eventual success in the litigation 
and (2) that the movant will be irreparably injured 
pendente lite if relief is not granted.... Moreover, 
while the burden rests upon the moving party to 
make these two requisite showings, the district 
court “should take into account, when they are relevant, 
(3) the possibility of harm to other interested 
persons from the grant or denial of the injunction, 
and (4) the public interest.” ... While these factors

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

structure the inquiry, however, no one aspect will 
necessarily determine its outcome. Rather, proper 
judgment entails a ‘delicate balancing’ of all elements. 
On the basis of the data before it, the district 
court must attempt to minimize the probable harm 
to legally protected interests between the time that 
the motion for a preliminary injunction*1366 is 
filed and the time of the final hearing. 

Id. at 136. Indeed, rulings of the Federal Circuit, 
along with requiring this “reasonable probability of 
eventual success,” have recognized the “ ‘delicate balancing’ 
of all elements.” See H.H. Robertson Co. v. 
United Steel Deck, Inc., 820 F.2d 384, 387-88 
(Fed.Cir.1987). 

Similarly in the Fourth Circuit the inquiry is: “1) 
Has the petitioner made a strong showing that it is 
likely to prevail upon the merits? 2) Has the petitioner 
shown that without such relief it will suffer irreparable 
injury? 3) Would the issuance of the injunction substantially 
harm other interested parties? 4) Wherein lies the 
public interest?” Blackwelder Furniture Co. of States-
ville, Inc. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 193 (4th 
Cir.1977) (when reviewing the grant of denial of interim 
injunctive relief “our review of the lower court's application 
of the law is not limited by the same ‘clearly 
erroneous' rule which restricts our review of its findings 
of fact under Rule 52(a)”); see First-Citizens Bank & 
Trust Co. v. Camp, 432 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir.1970) 
(applying the four-factors and reversing the district 
court's grant of a preliminary injunction). 

In the Fifth Circuit the four factors are recited as 
“(1) a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will prevail on 
the merits, (2) a substantial threat that plaintiff will suffer 
irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) 
that the threatened injury to plaintiff outweighs the 
threatened harm the injunction may do to defendant, 
and (4) that granting the preliminary injunction will not 
disserve the public interest.” Canal Authority of State of 
Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir.1974). 
The “substantial likelihood of prevailing” is not the 
same as raising a substantial question. 

Again for the Sixth Circuit, the “well-established” 

factors are: “(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the 
preliminary injunction will succeed on the merits of the 
claim; (2) whether the party seeking the injunction will 
suffer irreparable harm without the grant of the extraordinary 
relief; (3) the probability that granting the 
injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) 
whether the public interest is advanced by the issuance 
of the injunction,” Six Clinics Holding Corp. II v. Cafcomp 
Systems, Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir.1997). 
The court recognized that “a finding that the movant has 
not established a strong probability of success on the 
merits will not preclude a court from exercising its discretion 
to issue a preliminary injunction if the movant 
has, at minimum, ‘show[n] serious questions going to 
the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs 
any potential harm to the defendant if the injunction 
is issued.’ ” Id. at 400 (alteration in original). 
This ruling gave weight to the court's discretion to preserve 
the status quo during the litigation, when the 
equitable factors warrant such discretion. 

In the Seventh Circuit: 

As a threshold matter, a party seeking a preliminary 
injunction must demonstrate (1) some likelihood of 
succeeding on the merits, and (2) that it has “no adequate 
remedy at law” and will suffer “irreparable 
harm” if preliminary relief is denied. If the moving 
party cannot establish either of these prerequisites, 
a court's inquiry is over and the injunction must be 
denied. If, however, the moving party clears both 
thresholds, the court must then consider: (3) the irreparable 
harm the non-moving party will suffer if 
preliminary relief is granted, balancing that harm 
against the irreparable harm to the moving party if 
relief is denied; and (4) the public interest, meaning 
the consequences of *1367 granting or denying the 
injunction to nonparties. 

Abbott Laboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 
F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir.1992). This court has observed that 
the standard for granting or denying a motion for a preliminary 
injunction is not unique to patent law, and has 
ruled that the standard of the regional circuit should apply, 
here the Seventh Circuit. See Mikohn Gaming 
Corp. v. Acres Gaming, Inc., 165 F.3d 891, 894

which the case was brought.”). 

In the Eighth Circuit, “The relevant factors on a 
motion for a preliminary injunction are: (1) the probability 
of success on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable 
harm to the movant; (3) the balance between this 
harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict 
on other interested parties; and (4) whether the issuance 
of an injunction is in the public interest.” Entergy, 
Arkansas, Inc. v. Nebraska, 210 F.3d 887, 898

stressed that “[t]he most important of the [preliminary 
injunction] factors is the appellants' likelihood of success 
on the merits.” 

The Ninth Circuit stressed the importance of the 
equitable factors: “Preliminary injunctive relief is available 
to a party who demonstrates either: (1) a combination 
of probable success on the merits and the possibility 
of irreparable harm; or (2) that serious questions are 
raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor. 
These two formulations represent two points on a sliding 
scale in which the required degree of irreparable 
harm increases as the probability of success decreases.”

may cause the opposing party; (3) the injunction, if 
issued, would not be adverse to the public interest; and

for meeting the fourth ‘probability of success' prerequisite 
becomes more lenient. The movant need only 
show ‘questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, 
difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair 
ground for litigation.’ ”). 

In the Eleventh Circuit, “A district court may grant 
injunctive relief if the movant shows (1) a substantial 
likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that irreparable 
injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) 
that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs 
whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the 
opposing party, and (4) that if issued the injunction 
would not be adverse to the public interest.” All Care

In the District of Columbia Circuit, “In considering 
whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief, the court 
must consider whether: (1) the party seeking the injunction 
has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; 
(2) the party seeking the injunction will be irreparably 
injured if relief is withheld; (3) an injunction will 
not *1368 substantially harm other parties; and (4) an 
injunction would further the public interest.” CSX 
Transp. Inc. v. Williams, 406 F.3d 667, 670 
(D.C.Cir.2005). 

All of the circuits have placed the preliminary injunction 
in terms of the likelihood of success on the 
merits and equitable factors. No circuit has held that it 
suffices simply to raise a “substantial question.” Raising 
a substantial question achieves the threshold requirement 
of the well-pleaded complaint; it does not demonstrate 
a likelihood of prevailing. See Christianson v. 
Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 
808-809, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (“A

explained, extends over ‘only those cases in which a

court finally adjudicates the dispute. In seeking a preliminary

holder must establish a likelihood of success on the 
merits both with respect to validity of its patent and

the same standard enunciated by this court,” and that 
“[t]he standards applied to the grant of a preliminary injunction

Summary 

To summarize my concern for the conflict that is 
here continued, I again point out that the dissenting 
opinion, despite its initial recitation of the correct four-
part criteria for deciding the grant or denial of *1369 a 
preliminary injunction, then applies the different and incorrect 
criterion of whether the defendant raised a 
“substantial question” that may render the patent 
“vulnerable”. That standard conflicts with precedent of 
the Supreme Court and all of the regional circuits, all of 
which require that likelihood of success on the merits be 
determined and weighed along with the equitable 
factors. It is not the law that raising a “substantial question” 
will “negate the patentee's likelihood of success.” 
Diss. op. at 1372. Raising a substantial question may 
avoid dismissal on the pleadings, but contrary to the 
view of the dissent, establishing that there is an issue 
for trial is not the same as establishing the likelihood of 
prevailing at trial. 

The district court analyzed the positions of both 
sides as well as the equitable factors, decided that Abbott 
was likely to prevail on the merits and that the 
equitable factors weighed in favor of Abbott, and exercised 
its discretion to grant the preliminary injunction. 
The dissent states that a showing of “vulnerability” 
shows that the defendant is likely to prevail on the merits; 
that is facially incorrect. The dissent also relies on 
some recent (2008) Federal Circuit decisions; these decisions 
are not “clearly established precedent,” for they 
cannot overcome earlier rulings of this court. Further, 
until today no opinion has equated the raising of a 
“substantial question” with a showing of likelihood of 
success on the merits. The following additional cases of 
the Federal Circuit are cited to show the established 
law: Jeneric/Pentron, Inc. v. Dillon Co., Inc., 205 F.3d 
1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2000) (“A preliminary injunction 
requires the movant to show four factors ... [and] 
‘[c]entral to the movant's burden are the likelihood of 
success and irreparable harm factors.’ ”); Intergraph

of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable 
harm or (2) serious questions going to the merits

party's favor.”). 

These rulings of the Federal Circuit accord with the 
principles of eBay, 547 U.S. at 394, 126 S.Ct. 1837, that 
“the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief 
rests within the equitable discretion of the district 
courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent 
with traditional principles of equity, in patent 
disputes no less than in other cases governed by such 
standards.” This court's contrary opinions stand alone. 
If in fact this court *1371 believes that there should be a 
different rule in patent cases, this court nonetheless has 
the rule that in the event of conflict between panels the 
earlier holding prevails until overturned en banc. Newell 
Companies v. Kenney Mfg. Corp., 864 F.2d 757, 765 
(Fed.Cir.1988) ( “This court has adopted the rule that 
prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent 
on subsequent panels unless and until overturned 
in banc.... Where there is a direct conflict, the precedential 
decision is the first.”). If there is to be a change 
from this court's prior rulings, it must be done en banc. 

As it stands, neither district courts, nor litigants, 
nor panels of this court, are provided with clear guidance, 
or any reason to reject the stricture of eBay, 547 

U.S. at 393, 126 S.Ct. 1837, that “[n]othing in the patent 
Act indicates that Congress intended such a departure” 
from “the long tradition of equity practice”. 
CONCLUSION 

Abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district 
court's grant of the preliminary injunction, adhered 
to after additional consideration in view of the Court's 
decision of KSR. The district court's findings of fact underlying 
the legal and equitable considerations are supported, 
and the judicial balancing of these considerations 
shows no abuse of discretion. The grant of the in


junction is affirmed. The case is remanded for further 

FN5

proceedings.

FN5. Sandoz requests that we instruct that on 
remand this case should be assigned to a different 
judge, in order to “further the interests of 
judicial economy”. We discern no basis for this 
request; it is denied. 

AFFIRMED 

GAJARSA, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 

I respectfully dissent from the court's opinion. 
There is no legal basis for the granting of a preliminary 
injunction, and its issuance is an abuse of discretion. 
Although generally the denial or issuance of a preliminary 
injunction is within the broad discretion of the district 
court, the decision of the district court must be reversed 
when it abuses its discretion. See Cybor Corp. v. 
FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1460 
(Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc ) (“A district court abuses its 
discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous 
findings of fact, is based on erroneous interpretations 
of the law, or is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or 
fanciful.”). 

“A preliminary injunction requires the movant to 
show four factors: (1) a reasonable likelihood of success 
on the merits, (2) the prospect of irreparable harm, (3) a 
balance of the parties' hardships in favor of injunction, 
and (4) no potential injury to an important public interest.” 
See Jeneric/Pentron, Inc. v. Dillon Co., 205 
F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2000). When the district court 
considers the four factors, “the likelihood of success 
factor plays a key role,” id., and that is the factor I will 
focus on in my dissent. Because of “the extraordinary 
nature of the relief, the patentee carries the burden of 
showing likelihood of success on the merits,” in light of 
the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial, 
with respect to the patent's validity, enforceability, and 
infringement. Nutrition 21 v. United States, 930 F.2d 
867, 869 (Fed.Cir.1991) (emphasis in original); see also 
Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 
F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2001). If the defendant “raises 
a substantial question concerning either infringement or 
validity, i.e., asserts an infringement or invalidity de

fense that the patentee cannot prove ‘lacks substantial 
merit,’ the preliminary injunction should not issue.” 
Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1350-51. This court has explained 
that: 

In resisting a preliminary injunction, however, one 
need not make out a case *1372 of actual invalidity. 
Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction 
stages, while validity is the issue at trial. The showing 
of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires 
less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary 
to establish invalidity itself. 

Abbott Labs. v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 452 F.3d 
1331, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2006) (herein “ Andrx ”) (quoting 
Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1359). 

The majority opinion postulates that the findings of 
the district court are correct. It is error to so conclude 
because the district court failed to properly consider and 
weigh the ample evidence produced by Sandoz that 
clearly established a substantial question of invalidity 
and rendered the patent vulnerable to an invalidity challenge 
at trial. Instead, the district court erroneously required 
proof of clear and convincing evidence of invalidity 
at the preliminary stages of the proceedings. As 
I explain below, this conflicts with our clearly established 
precedent. 

Under our precedent, the likelihood of success 
factor is properly analyzed by considering whether the 
alleged infringer raises a substantial question as to 
validity. See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. 
MacDermid Printing Solutions, L.L.C., 525 F.3d 1353, 
1358 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“[I]f the accused infringer raises a 
substantial question regarding validity, the district court 
should find that the patentee has not shown a likelihood 
of success on the merits.” (internal quotation marks 
omitted)). Indeed, this court has consistently held that 
an alleged infringer can negate the patentee's likelihood 
of success on the merits-and thus defeat a preliminary 
injunction-by raising a substantial question as to validity. 
For example, in Genentech, this court explained: 

In order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success, 
[the patentee] must show that, in light of the 

presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on 
the merits, (1) it will likely prove that [the alleged infringer] 
infringes the [ ] patent and (2) its infringement 
claim will likely withstand [the alleged infringer's] 
challenges to the validity and enforceability 
of the [ ] patent. In other words, if [the alleged infringer] 
raises a “substantial question” concerning 
validity, enforceability, or infringement (i.e., asserts a 
defense that [the patentee] cannot show “lacks substantial 
merit”) the preliminary injunction should not 
issue. More specifically, with regard to [the alleged 
infringer's] validity defenses, the question on appeal 
is whether there is substantial merit to [the alleged infringer's] 
assertion that the [ ] patent claim [is invalid]. 


Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 108 F.3d 
1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir.1997). Our subsequent cases consistently 
applied the law as it was explained in Genentech. 
See, e.g., Tate Access Floors v. Interface Architectural 
Res., 279 F.3d 1357, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2002) (“In 
order to demonstrate likely success on the merits, [the 
patentee] must show that, in light of the presumptions 
and burdens applicable at trial, it will likely prove that 
[the alleged infringer] infringes the asserted claims of 
the [ ] patent and that the patent will likely withstand 
[the alleged infringer's] challenges to its validity. If [the 
alleged infringer] raises a substantial question concerning 
infringement or validity, meaning that it asserts a 
defense that [the patentee] cannot prove ‘lacks substantial 
merit,’ the preliminary injunction issued improperly.” 
(internal citations omitted; citing Genentech, 108 
F.3d at 1364 and Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1350-51)). 

Our most recent cases continue to adhere to the law 
as it was explained in Genentech. See, e.g., *1373Erico 
Int'l Corp. v. Vutec Corp., 516 F.3d 1350, 1352, 1354 
(Fed.Cir.2008) (stating that “[the alleged infringer] 
must show a substantial question of invalidity to avoid a 
showing of likelihood of success” and vacating the preliminary 
injunction “[b]ecause this court finds that [the 
alleged infringer] has raised a substantial question as to 
the validity of the patent at issue”); PHG Techs., LLC v. 
St. John Cos., 469 F.3d 1361, 1365, 1369 
(Fed.Cir.2006) (explaining that “in order to defeat the

injunction on grounds of potential invalidity, [the alleged 
infringer], as the party bearing the burden of 
proof on the issue at trial, must establish a substantial 
question of invalidity” and holding the district court 
clearly erred in finding the patentee was likely to succeed 
“because [the alleged infringer] has satisfied its 
burden of raising a substantial question of invalidity”). 
Thus, under our clearly established precedent, when the 
alleged infringer raises a substantial question regarding 
validity, a preliminary injunction cannot issue because 
the patentee has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of 
success on the merits. 

While Section VI of the opinion contains a superfluity 
of citations, it does not state the law relevant to 
this case. It is a pleasant, ambulatory, and meandering 
discussion; but it is not required to decide this case, is 
not part of the majority opinion, and is clearly dicta. Although 
Section VI discusses the relevant four-factor test 
and properly emphasizes the likelihood of success 
factor, it ignores the way this court has consistently analyzed 
whether or not a patentee has demonstrated it will 
likely succeed at trial. The real question before us in 
this case, as our precedent clearly explains, is whether 
the district court erred in finding that Sandoz had not 
established a substantial question as to the obviousness 
of the '718 patent. See, e.g., Genentech, 108 F.3d at 
1364 (“[T]he question on appeal is whether there is substantial 
merit to [the alleged infringer's] assertion that 
the [ ] patent claim [is invalid].”). Sandoz has, in fact, 
raised and substantially established that the validity of 
the '718 patent is vulnerable, and on the record before 
us, Abbott failed to prove the invalidity defense “lacks 
substantial merit.” See Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 
1350-51 (“If [the alleged infringer] raises a substantial 
question concerning either infringement or validity, i.e., 
asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the 
patentee cannot prove ‘lacks substantial merit,’ the preliminary 
injunction should not issue.”). Thus, the district 
court committed reversible error when it analyzed 
the likelihood of success factor and determined that Abbott 
had established it would likely succeed on the merits. 
In light of that error, I would vacate the preliminary 
injunction and remand for reconsideration and reweighing 
of the injunctive factors. Moreover, various addi


tional legal errors taint the district court's decision. 

I. 
The district court's grant of a preliminary injunction 
rested on only two claims, claims 1 and 4 of the '718 
patent. Claim 1 reads: 

a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of 
an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment, 
comprising 

an erythromycin derivative and 

from about 5[%] to about 50% by weight of a phar


FN1

maceutically acceptable polymer [ ], so that when 
ingested orally, *1374 the composition induces statistically 
significantly lower mean fluctuation index 
[DFL] in the plasma than an immediate release composition 
of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining 
bioavailability substantially equivalent to that 
of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin 
derivative. 

FN1. The specification of the '718 patent 
states, in a list of definitions, that “ ‘ pharmaceutically 
acceptable’ as used herein, means 
those compounds which are, within the scope 
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in 
contact with the tissues of humans and lower 
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic 
response, and the like, in keeping with a 
reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for 
their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis 
of antimicrobial infections.” In my 
judgment the district court's claim construction 
is ambiguous as to whether the pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer must extend release or 
whether it can be part of a matrix in which other 
components extend the release. Sandoz is 
correct that there needs to be some showing 
that the polymer acts to extend release. 

'718 Patent, col.11 ll.28-38. Claim 4 similarly 
claims an erythromycin derivative and “from about 
5[%] to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymer” but has different PK parameters.

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

Id. col. 11 ll.48-58. Claim 2 and claim 3 are dependant 
claims of claim 1. Claim 2 claims “the pharmaceutical 
composition of claim 1, wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic 
water-soluble polymer.” Id. col.11 ll.39-40. 
Claim 3 claims “the pharmaceutical composition of 
claim 2, wherein the polymer is selected from the group 
consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine, hydroxypropyl cellulose, 
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, 
vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers, methacrylic 
acid copolymers, maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl ether 
copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof.” Id. 
col. 11 ll.41-47. 

Claims 1 and 4 of the '718 patent have three basic 
limitations: (a) an erythromycin derivative; (b) 5% to 
50% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer; 
and (c) various PK parameters. In the preferred 
embodiment, the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin 
and the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is 
HPMC at 10% to 30% by weight of the composition. 
Claim 4 requires PK parameters be such that “upon oral 
ingestion, maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin 
derivative are lower than those produced by an 
immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and 
[AUC] and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially 
equivalent to that of the immediate release 
pharmaceutical composition.” Id. col.11 ll.52-58. Claim 
1 achieves similar results with slightly different parameters. 
For claim 1, the composition must have a 
“statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index,” 
DFL, which is defined in the specification as DFL 
=(C-C/C), id. col.3 ll.29-30, and substan


max min Av

tially equivalent bioavailability, which the district court 
found meant that the “[ER] AUC values must be 
between 80% to 125% within a 90% confidence level as 
compared to the immediate release composition AUC 

FN2

values.” Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc., 500 
F.Supp.2d 807, 831 (N.D.Ill.2007) (herein “ Sandoz I 
”). 

FN2. These figures are based on FDA definitions. 


II. 
Sandoz based its obviousness arguments primarily 
on three prior art references, which it argues combined 

with common sense and the ordinary skill of the art at 
the time make the '718 patent anticipated or obvious. 
First, Sandoz argues that the PTC Application WO 
95/30422 (“the '422 publication”) filed by Pfizer, discloses 
a controlled release dosage form of azithromycin, 
which like clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative. 

FN3 

According to the disclosure, these controlled released 
compositions operate to release the drug substantially 
slower than the immediate release*1375 versions 
to reduce GI side effects. And, as Sandoz points out, the 
controlled release compositions disclosed in the '422 
publication include a hydrophilic polymer composition 
of azithromycin, with a preferred embodiment being a 
matrix tablet containing 15% to 35% HPMC. Second, 
Sandoz noted that the '190 patent owned by Abbott discloses 
and claims controlled release compositions of 
clarithromycin in an (non-polymer) alginate matrix 
which are administered once a day and have slowed absorption 
such that they are bioequivalent with the current 
immediate release twice-a-day compositions and 
maintain therapeutic levels at 24 hours after ingestion. 
Claim 14 of the '190 patent also claims other marolides 

FN4

including azithromycin. Third, Sandoz argues that 
the '571 publication, filed by Eli Lilly, discloses sustained 
release formulations for antimicrobial agents including 
clarithromycin, which contain an active agent, 
namely a hydrophilic polymer such as HPMC, and an 
acrylic polymer. According to the specification, these 
formulations differ from the prior art that uses just hydrophilic 
polymers in that they are designed to allow a 
constant rate of release throughout the GI tract. In particular, 
the '571 publication disclosed using from about 
5% to about 29% by weight hydrophilic polymer, and 
about 0.5% to about 25% by weight acrylic polymer, 
with the total weight of the two polymers not exceeding 
30% by weight. 

FN3. Abbott specifically carved out azithromycin 
from its definition of an erythromycin derivative 
in the '718 patent. See Andrx, 452 F.3d 
at 1337. 

FN4. In Andrx, this court relied primarily on 
the '190 patent, as combined with the '422 publication 
to find that there was a substantial

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

question as to the obviousness of the '718 patent 
claims. 452 F.3d at 1340-41. First, we concluded 
that “Teva makes substantial arguments 
that the '190 patent discloses a clarithromycin 
composition ... that arguably has the pharmacokinetic 
parameters required in claim 4 of the 
' 718 patent.” Id. at 1340. And we explained: 

Because the '190 patent explicitly discloses 
only clarithromycin controlled release compositions, 
yet claims azithromycin compositions, 
... Abbott has represented to the [PTO] 
that the differences between clarithromycin 
and azithromycin were such that azithromycin 
could be substituted into a controlled release 
clarithromycin composition by a person 
of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.... 
As a result, based on Abbott's 
own '190 patent, there exists a substantial 
argument that a person of ordinary skill 
in the art would be motivated to combine the 
'422 publication, namely the use of HPMC in 
extended release macrolide compositions, 
with the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation 
of success. 

Id. at 1341. In this case, Abbott presented 
evidence at trial suggesting that this court 
was scientifically incorrect to find that the ' 
190 patent disclosed compounds that arguably 
had the same PK values as the asserted 
claims. Sandoz, based on this new evidence, 
disclaimed any reliance on the scientific 
evidence of the '190 patent disclosing compounds 
with the same PK values as the '718 
patent. However, contrary to the majority 
opinion, Sandoz can rely on Andrx's conclusion 
that it would have been obvious for a 
person skilled in the art to substitute clarithromycin 
for azithromycin in an extended release 
formula with the anticipation of success 
without undue experimentation. 

In addition to challenging the validity of the '718 

patent based on the '190 patent, the '422 publication and 

the '571 publication, Sandoz also relies on various evid


ence that the PK parameters specified in the '718 patent 
were well known in the art and would have been sought 
by anyone designing a controlled release formulation. 
Most strikingly, the testimony of one of the inventors 
named on the '718 patent, Linda Gustavson, an Abbott 
employee, supports the Sandoz position. In particular, 
Gustavson testified as follows: 

Q: Did you tell [the formulations department] what 
pharmacokinetic parameters there should be? 
A: I mean, not specific numbers, but relative to the 
IR, yes. I told at least Sue that what we needed was 
*1376 a lower Cmax, an AUC that met FDA requirements 
for bioequivalence and a Cmin that was at least 
comparable to the IR. 
Q: And where did you get these parameters? 
... 

A: A few years of experience, I guess. They're the-I 
mean certainly the Cmax and AUC are very basic PK 
parameters determined in virtually every study that 
has pharmacokinetics. Cmin [ ] might or might not be 
important depending upon the drug you were talking 
about and what part of the pharmacokinetics you 
though might be associated with efficacy or safety. 
For clarithromycin, there was some thought that keeping 
the concentrations above some minimum level 
might be at least in part important to maintaining effectiveness 
efficacy. 
Q: Would you say that these PK parameters were 
pretty much known in the art? 
A: Absolutely, yes. 
Furthermore, Sandoz submitted references from 
1983 (over a decade before the ' 718 application was 
submitted), which explained, inter alia, that the 
“objectives and possible advantages of controlled release 
dosage” forms included “maintain[ing] therapeutic 
drug levels,” “reduc[ing] dosing frequency,” 
“reduc[ing] fluctuations in drug levels,” and “reduc[ing] 
side effects.” And the reference explained that the 
“essence of controlled drug release” was to “obtain pro

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

longed circulating drug levels with less fluctuation compared 
to conventional dosage forms, and to achieve 
these with less frequent drug administration.” They also 
submitted references showing that HPMC was considered 
the “controlled release agent of choice” in the 
field. 

The district court, writing prior to KSR, found that, 
despite this Court's decision in Andrx to the contrary, 
claims 1 and 4 of the '718 patent were not obvious (at 
least based on the preliminary record). The trial court's 
finding rested on the fact that, contrary to this court's 
conclusion in Andrx, new evidence established that the ' 
190 patent, the '571 publication, and the WO '422 publication 
did not disclose the specific PK limitations of 
the '718 patent. The court recognized that “[g]enerally, 
a showing that there is an established structural relationship 
between a prior art composition and the claimed 
composition demonstrates a prima facie case of obviousness.” 
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 840. See In re 
Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692 (Fed.Cir.1990) (en banc) 
(“[S]tructural similarity between claimed and prior art 
subject matter, proved by combining references or otherwise, 
where the prior art gives reason or motivation to 
make the claimed compositions, creates a prima facie 
case of obviousness.”). Still, the court concluded that 
Abbott had preliminarily rebutted this showing by 
showing the specific PK properties embodied in the 
claims were unobvious. The trial court found that “[t]o 
succeed on its obvious[ness] claim, Sandoz must produce 
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were 
disclosed in the prior art or were at the very least inherent 
to the structural limitations of the prior art compositions.” 
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 840. Sandoz, the 
court found, had not done so. Id. Moreover, the trial 
court found that “because the '190 prior art does not disclose 
the [specific] PK profile of the '718 patent, a person 
skilled in the art would not be motivated to look at 
the WO '422 publication and interchange clarithromycin 
for azithromycin.” Id. at 841. 

Subsequently, the district court denied Sandoz's 
motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending 
appellate review in light of the just issued KSR opinion. 
The court held that under KSR it was still *1377 neces


sary to “demonstrate the presence of all claim limitations 
in the prior art” and that Sandoz had not produced 
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were disclosed 
in the prior art or inherent to the structural limitations 
of the prior art compositions. Abbott Labs. v. 
Sandoz, 500 F.Supp.2d 846, 851-53 (N.D.Ill.2007). According 
to the district court, it thus had not and did not 
need to reach the TSM test (or any change in the application 
of this test brought on by KSR). Id. at 853. 

On appeal, there is no real dispute that the '571 
publication expressly discloses a “sustained release 
matrix formulation in tablet form comprising ... erythromycin” 
and containing from about 5% by weight to 
about 29% by weight of a hydrophilic polymer, thus 
meeting all of the structural limitations of the ' 718 
claims. Moreover, the prior art clearly disclosed sustained 
release versions of clarithromycin and creating 
extended release formulations of erythromycin derivatives 
using polymers, preferably HPMC. And evidence 
shows that the desirability of the PK parameters claimed 
were well known in the art. 

In light of this evidence, Sandoz raised a substantial 
question as to the obviousness of the '718 patent. The 
district court's decision to the contrary constituted an 
abuse of discretion. First, it was clearly error to find, as 
a matter of law, that since none of the prior art references 
cited by Sandoz explicitly disclosed a composition 
that had the PK limitations of the ' 718 patent, it 
had failed to demonstrate “the presence of all claim limitations 
in the prior art,” and therefore that the '718 invention 
could not be obvious. Contrary to the majority, 
this holding relies on an improperly limited view of 
what types of references can be combined to show obviousness 
and an impermissibly cramped view of the Supreme 
Court's holding in KSR. There is no absolute requirement 
that each claim limitation be disclosed in a 
prior art reference. See, e.g., Takeda Chem. Indus. v. Alphapharm 
Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1356 
(Fed.Cir.2007) (“We have held that structural similarity 
between claimed and prior art subject matter, proved by 
combining references or otherwise, where the prior art 
gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions, 
creates a prima facie case of obviousness.”

(emphasis added)); Tegal Corp. v. Tokyo Electron Am., 
Inc., 257 F.3d 1331, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2001) 

(acknowledging that a claim could be obvious over a 
single prior art reference that does not disclose one of 
the limitations in the claim). Rather, in all cases, the 
touchstone of the analysis is whether the “differences 
between the subject matter sought to be patented and 
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole 
would have been obvious at the time the invention was 
made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to 
which said subject matter pertains.” 35 U.S.C. § 103; 
KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 
1727, 1734, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007); see also Takeda, 
492 F.3d at 1357 (explaining that “in cases involving 
new chemical compounds” to show a prima facie case 
of obviousness one must “identify some reason that 
would have led a chemist to modify a known compound 
in a particular manner” (emphasis added)). Thus, a given 
claim limitation may be obvious over the prior art 
even if no single reference had specifically disclosed 
that limitation. Moreover, even assuming an absolute 
rule that to be obvious a claim must be a combination of 
elements disclosed in the prior art, that standard was 
met here. As the Supreme Court reiterated in KSR, 
“inventions in most, if not all, instances rely upon 
building blocks long since uncovered, and claimed discoveries 
almost of necessity will be combinations of 
what, in some sense, is already known.” 127 S.Ct. at 
1741. In other words, it is the rare invention that is not a 

FN5

*1378 combination of prior art elements.And this 
is not one of such rare cases. Whether or not the prior 
art disclosed compounds displaying the particular PK 
parameters in the ' 718 patent, Sandoz did provide evidence 
suggesting that the PK parameters disclosed in the 
'718 patent were absolutely known in the art and that 
the prior art established that they were desirable in an 
extended release formula (and indeed, that at least the 
AUC equivalence and lower Cmax were most likely essential 
to an extended release formula, at least one that 
would be approved by the FDA). This is sufficient to 
show that the claims might be a combination of elements 
previously known in the art. The prior art on record 
disclosing the PK limitations is of course further 
removed from the invention than, for example, a patent 
that disclosed a related drug formulation with the same 

PK limitations as the '718 patent. But while this may 
well make the former less likely than the latter to make 
the '718 patent claims obvious, there is nothing as a 
matter of law that prevents the invention from being 
considered an obvious combination of the prior art 
teachings contained in the current preliminary record. 

Cf. Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd., 

499 F.3d 1293, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2007) (explaining that 
while it is necessary for there to be “some articulated 
reasoning with some rational underpinning to support 
the legal conclusion of obviousness ... such reasoning 
need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific 
subject matter of the challenged claim” (internal 

FN6

quotation marks omitted)).

FN5. Given KSR's broad understanding of 
nearly all or perhaps all inventions being combinations 
of elements in the prior art, the 
parties' dispute about whether KSR should be 
limited to such inventions becomes largely irrelevant. 
In any event, while KSR's holding is 
directed particularly at the TSM test, it certainly 
appears that the Court intended to expound 
principles of obviousness jurisprudence 
that were generally applicable. And particularly 
relevant to the case at bar, this court has 
already applied KSR's teachings to the question 
of whether new chemical compositions are obvious 
in light of the fact that chemists of ordinary 
skill would attempt to modify known substances 
in certain ways to “obtain compounds 
with improved properties.” Takeda, 492 F.3d at 
1356. Accordingly, I think the district court 
clearly erred in concluding that KSR was not 
relevant to the question of obviousness here.

amlodipine maleate tablet formulations sought 
to be solved by the inventors of the '303 patent.”). 


Second, it is not dispositive that Abbott was not absolutely 
certain that using the formulations disclosed in 
the '422 patent would create a formulation with the desired 
PK parameters. Even before KSR, this court's 
“case law [was] clear that obviousness cannot be 
avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability 
in the art so long as there was a reasonable 
probability of success.” Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364. And 
as the Supreme Court stated in KSR, “[w]hen there is a 
design need or market pressure to solve a problem and 
there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, 
a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue 
the known options within his or her technical grasp. 
If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the 
product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common 
sense.” 127 S.Ct. at 1742 (“One of the ways in 
which a patent's subject matter can be proved obvious is 
by noting that there existed at the time of invention a 
known problem for which there was an obvious solution 
encompassed by the patent claims.”). 

*1379 Third, the long standing precedent of this 
court and our predecessor, recently highlighted and relied 
upon in Pfizer is that “discovery of an optimum 
value of a variable” in a known process or composition 
is “usually obvious.” 480 F.3d at 1368 (citing In re 
Peterson, 315 F.3d 1325, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2003); In re 
Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 276 (CCPA 1980); In re Aller, 
42 C.C.P.A. 824, 220 F.2d 454, 456 (1955)). Accordingly, 
in Pfizer, for example, the court found that the 
optimization of a pharmaceutical compound to determine 
which acid salt was best was obvious, where “the 
prior art heavily suggests the particular anion used to 
form the salt.” Id. Similarly, here, if the PK parameters 
claimed were well known, and only routine experimentation 
by someone skilled in the art would have been necessary, 
in light of the HPMC formulations disclosed by 
the '422 publication and '571 publication, to create an 
ER clarithromycin-HPMC formulation with the claimed 
PK parameters, this would be sufficient to create a 
prima facie case of obviousness. 

Accordingly, the district court erred in concluding 
that the fact that the ' 422 publication and '190 patent 
did not disclose the PK limitations of the asserted 
claims precluded a finding of obviousness. This legal 
error constitutes an abuse of discretion. And contrary to 
the holding of the district court, Sandoz has raised a 
“substantial question concerning” the obviousness of 
the asserted claims. On this basis, I would reverse the 
decision of the district court. 

III. 
Sandoz also argues that several acts by Abbott during 
the prosecution of its patent application constitute 
inequitable conduct and, thus, show that the district 
court abused its discretion in not rejecting the motion 
for a preliminary injunction based on the likelihood that 
the patents would be declared unenforceable. 

The Patent Examiner initially rejected the claims of 
the '718 application and requested that Abbott show that 
one of its prior art compositions of clarithromycin, 
which was described as an immediate release pediatric 
suspension formula, did not have the same extended release 
properties as Abbott's claimed invention. In response, 
Abbott submitted a declaration by Linda Gustavson 
stating that the Cof the ER clarithromycin

max 

“is statistically significantly lower than that for IR formulation 
given twice daily.” J.A. 10015. Abbott now 
admits that this statement was incorrect-that the data 
Gustavson relied on did not show a statistically significant 
lowering of the C-but only a non-statistically 

max

significant apparent lowering, and Gustavson herself 
admits that she never performed any statistical analysis 
of the data and would not have known how to do it. 

The district court found that the concededly false 
statement was immaterial since all the Examiner asked 
was whether the two products have the same PK properties. 
According to the district court, “[g]iven the accuracy 
of the ultimate conclusion-that the extended release 
formulation was indeed different from the immediate 
release suspension formulation, Gustavson's declaration 
of a ‘statistically significantly lower’ Cmax is immaterial 
despite the fact that it satisfies the definition of 
‘material’ provided by 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(b).” Sandoz I, 
500 F.Supp.2d at 822. The district court reasoned that

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

despite meeting the standard for materiality of § 1.56(b) 
a reasonable examiner would not have considered the 
statement important. Moreover, the district court emphasized 
that no claim of the '718 patent requires the 
extended release formulation to have a statistically significant 
lower C than the immediate release formu


max 

lation. 

*1380 The Gustavson statement was material, or 
more to the point, there is substantial likelihood that 
Sandoz would be able to so establish at the merits stage. 
First, contrary to the erroneous conclusion of the district 
court, we have held that “all misstatements or admissions 
that satisfy [37 C.F.R. § 1.56(b) ] are considered 
material.” Monsanto Co. v. Bayer Bioscience N.V., 514 
F.3d 1229, 1237 n. 11 (Fed.Cir.2008). In addition, while 
no claim element in the '718 patent specifically states 
that the C value must be statistically significantly 

max 

lower, it does require Cvalues that are “lower” than 

max 

in the immediate release formulation. Despite the fact 
that in other claim elements Abbott uses the term 
“statistically significantly lower,” it is far from clear 
that one can establish that the C value is lower if 

max 

the data does not show a statistically significant difference, 
which by definition, as ordinarily understood, 
means that the data cannot conclusively establish that 
there is a real difference. This court previously recognized 
that “there is little in the ['718] patent itself that 
establishes the differences (if any) between parameters 
that are simply ‘lower’ rather than ‘statistically significantly 
lower.’ ” Andrx, 452 F.3d at 1339 n. 4. Moreover, 
regardless of the claim construction, it would be important 
(if not dispositive) to a reasonable examiner to know 
that Abbott did not have data which showed a lower C 
to any statistical significance over the structurally 

max 

similar prior art suspension formulas in deciding whether 
to allow the claim over this prior art. 

On this basis alone, the district court abused its discretion 
because it created such a high bar for materiality 
that in essence no statement or withholding of information 
would be material if it would not change the ultimate 
outcome of allowing the patent. This is inconsistent 
with our precedent. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche, 
Inc. v. Promega Corp., 323 F.3d 1354, 1368 

(Fed.Cir.2003) (“The fact that the examiner did not 
have to rely on the purity representations in issuing the 
patent is not inconsistent with a finding of materiality. 
Although the inventors' statements regarding purity 
were not the principal focus of the office action response, 
they were clearly an important aspect of it. Under 
the circumstances, a reasonable examiner would 
have wanted to know that the patentability argument 
based on purity was unsupported by the experimental 
results cited by the inventors.” (internal citation omitted)); 
Merck & Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 873 
F.2d 1418, 1421 (Fed.Cir.1989) (rejecting a “but for” 
standard of materiality). 

In addition, while the district court did not reach 
the issue of intent, the fact that Gustavson submitted a 
declaration to the PTO in which she claimed to have 
found a statistically significant lowering of Cdes


max 

pite now admitting to never having done any statistical 
analysis is sufficient circumstantial evidence of intent to 
raise a substantial question of inequitable conduct, if 
not necessarily to prove inequitable conduct on the merits. 


The district court also found that the failure by Ab


FN7

bott to disclose a new study *1381 was immaterial 
because Abbott simply “chose to rely on the results of 
several other studies that showed differing mean DFL 
values” and the totality of the evidence demonstrates 
that the prior art formulation did not have the “same 
broad PK properties as those claimed for the ER formulation.” 
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 824. The test is not 
whether the Examiner would have refused to allow the 
patent to issue without the information, but just whether 
it would have been “important” to her consideration. 
Here the extent the PK parameters of the ER formulation 
differed from the clarithromycin formulations in 
the prior art was the primary focus of the examiner's 
concerns regarding patentability, and Abbott's ability to 
establish sufficient differences was the basis for allowing 
the claims. It was not for Abbott to decide unilaterally 
that it preferred the results of one set of studies that 
supported patentability and therefore could ignore studies 
reaching the opposite result. Cf. Paragon Podiatry 
Lab. v. KLM Labs., 984 F.2d 1182, 1193 (Fed.Cir.1993)

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341) 

(finding inequitable conduct for failure to disclose sales 
data and noting that “where the decision of whether or 
not to disclose sales before the critical date is close, the 
case should be resolved by disclosure, not by the applicant's 
unilateral decision.”). 

FN7. The written description of the '718 patent 
states that “The mean DFL values for the controlled 
release formulation [another Abbott prior 
art reference disclosing a clarithromycin formulation] 
and for the IR are substantially equal 
in value....” '718 Patent, col.11 ll.18-19. And it 
explains that lower DFL values for the ER formulation 
of the '718 patent show that it 
provides “less variable clarithromycin concentrations 
throughout the day than the IR and the 
sustained release compositions.” ' 718 Patent, 
col.11 ll.25-26. These statements were correct 
based on three studies that had been done prior 
to filing the application. However, a new study 
W98-268, which Gustavson had knowledge of, 
and which issued while the application was 
pending, found that there was a statistically 
significant lower DFL value for the sustained 
release formulas than the IR formulas. Gustavson, 
however, failed to disclose the results of 
this new study. 

Accordingly, I would also vacate the preliminary 
injunction based on the allegations of inequitable conduct. 
The evidence raises a substantial question of unenforceability 
that makes the patents vulnerable to being 
found unenforceable at trial. Thus, the district court 
erred when it concluded that Abbott had shown it would 
likely succeed on the merits. 

Because of the reasons stated above, I would reverse 
the district court on the basis that there are substantial 
questions of both validity and enforceability of 
the '718 patent preventing a finding of likelihood of 
success on the merits.
