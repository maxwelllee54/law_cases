v.
John J. DOLL, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce
for Intellectual Property and Acting Director
of the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
and United States Patent and Trademark Office,
Defendants-Appellants.
No. 2008-1352.
March 20, 2009.
Background: Pharmaceutical company and inventor
brought action against Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) challenging newly-adopted
rules that limited number of continuing applications,
requests for continued examination (RCE),
and claims that applicant could make. The United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
James C. Cacheris, Senior District Judge, 541
F.Supp.2d 805, granted summary judgment for
plaintiffs. PTO appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) provision that empowers the PTO to establish
regulations, not inconsistent with law, to govern
the conduct of proceedings in the Office, does not
vest the PTO with any general substantive rulemaking
power;
(2) determination by PTO as to scope of its own authority
under provision that gave it authority to
establish regulations, not inconsistent with law,
to govern the conduct of proceedings in the Office,
was not entitled to Chevron deference;
(3) final rules that limited number of continuing applications,
RCE, and claims that applicant could
make were procedural;
(4) examination support document (ESD) rule, requiring
patent applicants who presented more than
five independent claims or 25 total claims to
provide examiner with information about prior art
and why they believed claims were patentable over
it, was procedural;
(5) rule requiring preexamination search of U.S.
patents and patent application publications, foreign
patent documents, and non-patent literature, and
requesting specific details about scope of search,
set forth facially reasonable procedural requirement;
(6) rule that limited continuation applications on
basis of total number of such applications previously
filed, without regard to when application was
filed, was invalid;
(7) rule requiring applicant to file petition showing
that the amendment, argument, or evidence sought
to be entered could not have been submitted prior to
the close of prosecution in the application was entitled
to Chevron deference; and
(8) ESD rule did not alter ultimate burdens of examiner
or applicant during examination.
Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
Bryson, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
Rader, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part.

PROST, Circuit Judge.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO) appeals the April 1, 2008 decision of
the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia granting summary judgment that
four recently promulgated rules exceed the scope of
the USPTO's rulemaking authority. Because we
conclude that the four rules are procedural, but that
Rule 78 is inconsistent with 35 U.S.C.  120, we affirm-
in-part, vacate-in-part, and remand.
I. BACKGROUND
In January 2006, the USPTO initiated two related
notice and comment rulemaking proceedings.
After receiving and considering the public comments,
the USPTO issued the new rules on August
21, 2007, with an effective date of November 1,
2007. Changes to Practice for Continued Examination
Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably
Indistinct Claims, and Examination of
Claims in Patent Applications, 72 Fed.Reg. 46,716
(Aug. 21, 2007). Four of the new rules
(collectively, the Final Rules) are at issue in this
appeal.
*1350 Two of the new rules, Final Rule 78 and
Final Rule 114, pertain to continuation applications
and requests for continued examination (RCEs)
and were issued to address the large and growing
backlog of unexamined patent applications. Id. at
46,717. Final Rule 78 governs the availability of
continuation and continuation-in-part applications.
FN1
Under the rule, an applicant is entitled to file
two continuation applications as a matter of right.
37 C.F.R.  1.78(d)(1)(i). If an applicant wishes to
pursue more than two continuation applications, he
must file a petition showing that the amendment,
argument, or evidence sought to be entered could
not have been submitted during the prosecution of
the prior-filed application. Id.  1.78(d)(1)(vi). If
the applicant cannot make the requisite showing,
the USPTO will accept the application for examination
but will refuse to enter, or will delete if
present, any specific reference to a prior-filed application.
Id.  1.78(d)(1). The effect of this is to
remove the application from the scope of 35 U.S.C.
120, which would otherwise entitle the application
to the filing date of the prior-filed application.
Final Rule 114 provides for similar treatment of
RCEs. Under the rule, an applicant is allowed one
RCE as a matter of right. Id.  1.114(f). For each
additional RCE, the applicant must file a petition
showing that the amendment, argument, or evidence
sought to be entered could not have been submitted
prior to the close of prosecution in the application.
Id.  1.114(g). The limitation on RCEs
is applied on the basis of application families,
rather than individual applications. Id.  1.114(f).
FN1. For a discussion of the problems created
by continuation applications, see
Mark A. Lemley & Kimberly A. Moore,
Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations, 84
B.U. L.Rev. 63, 71-83 (2004).
The two other rules, Final Rule 75 and Final
Rule 265, are intended to address the USPTO's difficulty
in examining applications that contain a

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 4
559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
large number of claims. 72 Fed.Reg. at 46,721. Final
Rule 75 requires an applicant who submits
either more than five independent claims or twenty-
five total claims to provide the examiner with information
in an examination support document
(ESD). 37 C.F.R.  1.75(b)(1). The requirements
for ESDs are set forth in Final Rule 265. To comply
with Final Rule 265, an applicant must conduct a
preexamination prior art search, provide a list of the
most relevant references, identify which limitations
are disclosed by each reference, explain how each
independent claim is patentable over the references,
and show where in the specification each limitation
is disclosed in accordance with 35 U.S.C.  112,
1. Id.  1.265(a).
Shortly after the Final Rules were published in
the Federal Register, Triantafyllos Tafas, SmithKline
Beecham Corporation, and Glaxo Group Limited
(collectively, Appellees) filed suit against the
USPTO. On October 31, 2007, the district court
preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Final
Rules. Tafas v. Dudas, 511 F.Supp.2d 652
(E.D.Va.2007) ( Tafas I ). Appellees then moved
for summary judgment that the Final Rules are invalid
and sought a permanent injunction against
their enforcement. Appellees' summary judgment
motions alleged that the Final Rules were impermissibly
substantive, inconsistent with law, arbitrary
and capricious, incomprehensibly vague, impermissibly
retroactive, and procedurally defective.
The district court agreed with Appellees that
the Final Rules were substantive rules that change
existing law and alter *1351 the rights of applicants
such as [Appellees] under the Patent Act. Tafas v.
Dudas, 541 F.Supp.2d 805, 814 (E.D.Va.2008) (
Tafas II ). Specifically, the district court found
that the Final Rules created limits on continuation
applications, RCEs, and claims that were inconsistent
with several sections of the Patent Act, as well
as precedent from this court and its predecessor, the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The district
court concluded that because the USPTO lacks substantive
rulemaking authority under Merck & Co.,
Inc. v. Kessler, 80 F.3d 1543, 1550 (Fed.Cir.1996),
the Final Rules exceed the USPTO's statutory jurisdiction
in violation of 5 U.S.C.  706(2). Tafas II,
541 F.Supp.2d at 814. Accordingly, the district
court granted Appellees' motion for summary judg
FN2
ment that the Final Rules are invalid.
FN2. The district court fully disposed of
the case on the grounds that the Final
Rules are substantive. As part of its analysis,
the court partially considered whether
the rules conflict with the law. Apart from
this, the court did not address Appellees'
other arguments.
The USPTO timely appealed. We have jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(1).
II. DISCUSSION
We review the district court's grant of summary
judgment without deference, reapplying the
same standard as the district court. Star Fruits
S.N.C. v. United States, 393 F.3d 1277, 1281
(Fed.Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate
only if the record shows there is no genuine issue
as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P.
56(c); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202
(1986). Under the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA), the reviewing court shall set aside agency
action if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance
with law, contrary to constitutional right, power,
privilege, or immunity, in excess of statutory jurisdiction,
authority, or limitations, or short of statutory
right, or without observance of procedure
required by law. 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A)-(D).
The USPTO alleges two main errors in the district
court's analysis. First, the USPTO argues that
the court erred by failing to give the agency's interpretation
of 35 U.S.C.  2(b)(2)'s grant of rulemaking
authority proper deference under Chevron
U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 5
559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
(1984). The USPTO contends that under a proper
application of Chevron, the inquiry in this case is
not whether the rules are substantive or procedural,
but whether they fit within a reasonable interpretation
of  2(b)(2), which gives the USPTO authority
to establish regulations, not inconsistent with law,
which ... shall govern the conduct of proceedings in
the Office ... [and] facilitate and expedite the processing
of patent applications. 35 U.S.C.  2(b)(2).
Second, the USPTO argues that even if the substantive/
procedural framework is applicable, the Final
Rules are clearly procedural. According to the
USPTO, the district court's erroneous conclusion
that the Final Rules are substantive was the result
of a mistaken interpretation of the rules, misapplication
of the statutes and precedent, and failure to
properly give deference to the USPTO's interpretation
of the Patent Act under Chevron and National
Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet
Services, 545 U.S. 967, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162
L.Ed.2d 820 (2005). We address each argument in
turn.
A. The Scope of the USPTO's Rulemaking Authority
Section 2(b)(2) of the Patent Act gives the
USPTO authority to
*1352 establish regulations, not inconsistent with
law, which ... (A) shall govern the conduct of
proceedings in the office; ... (C) shall facilitate
and expedite the processing of patent applications,
particularly those which can be filed,
stored, processed, searched, and retrieved electronically
... (D) may govern the recognition and
conduct of agents, attorneys, or other persons
representing applicants or other parties before the
Office....
35 U.S.C.  2(b)(2). Additionally, 35 U.S.C.
132(b) requires the USPTO to prescribe regulations
to provide for the continued examination of
applications for patent at the request of the applicant.
The USPTO asserts that this case should be
fully resolved in its favor based on the language of
these two sections. So long as the Final Rules fall
within the scope of either  2(b)(2) or  132(b), the
USPTO contends, they do not exceed its rulemaking
authority. Further, the USPTO argues that this
court has previously recognized that the USPTO's
interpretation of its rulemaking authority under
2(b)(2) is entitled to Chevron deference. See, e.g.,
Lacavera v. Dudas, 441 F.3d 1380, 1383
(Fed.Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1205, 127
S.Ct. 1246, 167 L.Ed.2d 74 (2007). The USPTO
thus argues that the district court erred by grafting a
distinction between substantive and procedural
rules onto the plain language of  2(b)(2) without
according any deference to the USPTO's interpretation.
Appellees maintain that the district court correctly
decided that the USPTO cannot make substantive
rules and no deference is due until it is established
that the USPTO has acted within its statutory
authority. We begin by addressing whether
the USPTO's authority is subject to the substantive/
procedural distinction, and then examine the proper
level of deference to be given in this case.
1. The Substantive/Procedural Distinction
We agree with the district court that  2(b)(2)
does not vest the USPTO with any general substantive
rulemaking power. Tafas II, 541
F.Supp.2d at 811. This principle is amply supported
by our precedent. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund
v. Quigg, 932 F.2d 920, 930 (Fed.Cir.1991) (A
substantive declaration with regard to the Commissioner's
interpretation of the patent statutes, whether
it be section 101, 102, 103, 112 or other section,
does not fall within the usual interpretation of [the
language in section 6, the predecessor of  2(b)(2)
].); Merck, 80 F.3d at 1550 (Section 6 does NOT
grant the Commissioner the authority to issue substantive
rules. Because Congress has not vested the
Commissioner with any general substantive rule-
making power, the Final Determination at issue in
this case cannot possibly have the force and effect
of law. (citations and quotation marks omitted));
Cooper Techs. Co. v. Dudas, 536 F.3d 1330, 1335
(Fed.Cir.2008) (To comply with section
2(b)(2)(A), a Patent Office rule must be
procedural-i.e., it must govern the conduct of

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
proceedings in the Office. ).
Additionally, when Merck was decided, 35
U.S.C.  6(a) gave the USPTO authority to establish
regulations that govern the conduct of proceedings.
We agree with Appellees that Congress's
decision to replace  6(a) with the current  2(b)(2),
which contains the same grant of authority to regulate
the conduct of proceedings in the Office is
indicative that Congress did not intend to give the
FN3
USPTO substantive rulemaking authority. See
*1353Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98
S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (Congress is presumed
to be aware of an administrative or judicial
interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation
when it re-enacts a statute without
change.).
FN3. While Cooper Technologies, 536
F.3d at 1336-37, casts doubt on the district
court's view that  2(b)(2)(B) requires notice
and comment rulemaking for all
USPTO rules, we nevertheless agree that
Congress did not hide the elephant of
substantive rulemaking authority in the
mousehole of  2(b)(2)(B). See Tafas II,
541 F.Supp.2d at 812; see also Whitman v.
Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468,
121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001).
Accordingly, we must reject the USPTO's argument
that the substantive/procedural distinction is
immaterial in this case.
2. Chevron Deference
The USPTO argues that the district court erred
by failing to accord Chevron deference at two
stages of its analysis. First, Chevron deference is
allegedly required for the threshold question of
whether  2(b)(2) vests the USPTO with substantive
rulemaking authority. Second, the USPTO
maintains that its interpretation of various sections
of the Patent Act, and its accordant belief that the
Final Rules are consistent therewith, is also entitled
to deference. We cannot accept the USPTO's first
argument, but we conclude that the USPTO's inter
pretations of statutes that pertain to the USPTO's
delegated authority are entitled to Chevron deference.
Before a reviewing court grants Chevron deference,
it must first determine whether the agency's
interpretation of the statute was made pursuant to
a congressional delegation of administrative authority.
Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638,
649, 110 S.Ct. 1384, 108 L.Ed.2d 585 (1990). This
threshold inquiry, which has been dubbed Chevron
step zero, determines whether courts should turn
to the Chevron framework at all. Thomas W. Merrill
& Kristin E. Hickman, Chevron's Domain, 89
Geo. L.J. 833, 836 (2001). Cases from this court
have concluded, in different circumstances, that an
agency's determination of the scope of its own authority
is not entitled to Chevron deference. See,
e.g., Borlem S.A.-Empreedimentos Industriais v.
United States, 913 F.2d 933, 937 (Fed.Cir.1990)
(A court is indeed obligated to give deference to
an agency acting within its scope of responsibility....
[However,] such deference should not apply
when the issue is the legal scope of an agency's authority.).
A majority of the Supreme Court has not
yet spoken to this issue. Cf. Miss. Power & Light
Co. v. Miss. ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 380, 108
S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring)
(Contrary to the dissent, we have held
that this rule of deference applies to an agency's interpretation
of a statute designed to confine its authority.
(citation omitted)) with id. at 386, 108
S.Ct. 2428 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (I cannot,
however, agree with Justice SCALIA's conclusion
that courts must defer to an agency's statutory construction
even where, as here, the statute is designed
to confine the scope of the agency's jurisdiction
to the areas Congress intended it to occupy.);
see also N. Ill. Steel Supply Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,
294 F.3d 844, 846-47 (7th Cir.2002) (recognizing
Justice Scalia's concurrence in Mississippi Power,
stating that the Supreme Court has not definitively
ruled on the issue, and declining to grant deference
to the agency's determination of its own jurisdiction).

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
We are not persuaded by the USPTO's arguments
in this case that Chevron deference should be
extended to the issue of whether  2(b)(2) provides
substantive rulemaking authority. To the extent the
USPTO relies on Federal Circuit cases that give
Chevron deference to the USPTO's*1354 interpretation
of certain phrases present in  2(b)(2), we
conclude that those cases are inapposite because
they involve judicial review of rules that are procedural,
and thus within the judicially interpreted
scope of the USPTO's rulemaking authority. See,
e.g., Bender v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368
(Fed.Cir.2007) (deferring to the USPTO's interpretation
of the phrase before the Office on review of
the USPTO's decision to discipline an attorney for
misconduct); Lacavera, 441 F.3d at 1383 (deferring
to the USPTO's interpretation of necessary qualifications
to be required of individuals who seek recognition
to practice before the USPTO); Stevens v.
Tamai, 366 F.3d 1325, 1333-34 (Fed.Cir.2004) (In
view of the reasonableness of the Office's rules
governing the procedure in patent interferences,
and the substantial deference we accord such rules
.... (emphasis added)). Because we decline to accord
deference with respect to the question of
whether the USPTO has substantive rulemaking authority,
our conclusion above that the USPTO does
not have such authority is unaffected by Chevron.
The next question is the level of deference to
be given to USPTO rules that are within the scope
of the USPTO's delegated authority, i.e., procedural
rules promulgated under  2(b)(2) or  132(b). Our
precedent is clear that the Chevron framework is
applicable to review of these rules. See, e.g.,
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337; Bender, 490 F.3d
at 1368; Lacavera, 441 F.3d at 1383; Stevens, 366
F.3d at 1333; Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d
1422, 1425 (Fed.Cir.1988). Thus, on review of a
procedural rule that has been issued by the USPTO,
we will give Chevron deference to the USPTO's interpretation
of statutory provisions that relate to the
exercise of delegated authority. See Cooper Techs.,
536 F.3d at 1337 (Because the Patent Office is
specifically charged with administering statutory
provisions relating to the conduct of proceedings
in the Office, 35 U.S.C.  2(a)(2)(A), we give
Chevron deference to its interpretations of those
provisions.).
B. Classification of the Final Rules
With the analytical framework established, we
turn to whether the Final Rules are substantive or
procedural. The parties agree that the USPTO has
authority under  2(b)(2) to promulgate procedural
rules. They vigorously disagree, however, as to
how the boundary between substantive and
procedural rules should be defined.
The district court relied on Chrysler Corp. v.
Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60
L.Ed.2d 208 (1979), to define as substantive any
rule that affect[s] individual rights and obligations.
Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 814. We do not
read Chrysler to create such a broad and absolute
rule. In the portion of Chrysler cited by the district
court, the Court simply noted a characteristic inherent
in the concept of a substantive rule  and
identified an important touchstone for distinguishing
those rules that may be binding or have the
force of law.  441 U.S. at 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705.
Substantive rules certainly affect individual rights
and obligations, but that inquiry does not necessarily
distinguish most procedural requirements, which
will also affect individual rights and obligations.
The Supreme Court itself made this observation
when drawing the line between substance and
procedure in the context of the Rules Enabling
Act. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 464-65,
85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965) (Undoubtedly
most alterations of the rules of practice and procedure
may and often do affect the rights of litigants.).
This court's predecessor made the same observation.
See In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 945
(CCPA 1982) (True, the *1355 rule is substantive
in that it relates to a condition under which a patent
will be granted which otherwise would have to be
denied for double patenting. Much of the content of
the PTO rules is substantive in this respect.).

rules in terms of whether they affect individual
rights and obligations, it has done so in the process
of distinguishing between interpretive and
substantive rules. See Animal Legal Def. Fund,
932 F.2d at 927; Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336.
We agree, therefore, with the USPTO that while the
inquiry set forth in Chrysler and used in Animal
Legal Defense Fund and Cooper Technologies may
be useful in defining the boundary between interpretive
and substantive rules, it is not dispositive on
the issue of whether the Final Rules are procedural.
In addition to Chrysler, the parties cite several
cases from the D.C. Circuit that have addressed the
FN4
boundaries of substantive rules.In American
Hospital Ass'n v. Bowen, the D.C. Circuit defined
substantive rules, as contrasted with interpretive
rules, as those which grant rights, impose obligations,
or produce other significant effects on private
interests, or which effect a change in existing law
or policy. 834 F.2d 1037, 1045 (D.C.Cir.1987)
(citations and quotation marks omitted). With respect
to the distinction between procedural and substantive
rules, Bowen suggested that substantive
rules encode[ ] a substantive value judgment or
put[ ] a stamp of approval or disapproval on a given
type of behavior. Id. at 1047. However, the D.C.
Circuit has also noted that, [o]f course, procedure
impacts on outcomes and thus can virtually always
be described as affecting substance. JEM Broad.
Co. v. FCC, 22 F.3d 320, 326 (D.C.Cir.1994)
(quoting Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. Dep't of
Transp., 900 F.2d 369, 383 (D.C.Cir.1990)
(Silberman, J., dissenting)). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit
held in Public Citizen v. Department of State
that although the State Department's decision not to
search documents produced after the date of a Freedom
of Information Act request represented a
judgment about procedural efficiency, such a
judgment does not convert a procedural rule into a
substantive one. 276 F.3d 634, 641 (D.C.Cir.2002)
(quotation marks omitted). Thus, the D.C. Circuit
has considered many of the issues underlying the
present case and has understandably hesitated to adopt
a conclusive test for when rules cross the line
between procedure and substance.
FN4. The concurrence and dissent each
correctly point out that this is not a case
arising under the notice and comment rule-
making provision of the APA. Therefore,
this case does not turn on whether the rules
are procedural within the meaning of 5
U.S.C.  553(b)(A). We recognize that the
definitions of substance and procedure
in the notice and comment rulemaking
context may embody policy considerations
that are not coextensive with the considerations
at issue in this case. However, we
find that these cases are nevertheless helpful
to the task of drawing a similar line
between substance and procedure in
the present case.
We are most persuaded in this case by the D.C.
Circuit's approach in JEM. At issue in that case
were hard look rules adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in response
to a significant number of carelessly prepared and
speculative applications for broadcasting licenses.
22 F.3d at 327. Under those rules, applications that
either failed to include necessary information or
contained incorrect or inconsistent information that
could not be resolved within the confines of the
application and with a high degree of confidence
were dismissed with no opportunity to cure the defect.
Id. at 322. The D.C. Circuit rejected JEM's
contention that the rules were substantive *1356 because
they deprive[d] license applicants of the opportunity
to correct errors or defects in their filings.
Id. at 327. In doing so, the court noted that a
critical feature of the procedural exception [in section
553 of the APA] is that it covers agency actions
that do not themselves alter the rights or interests
of parties, although [they] may alter the
manner in which the parties present themselves or
their viewpoints to the agency. Id. at 326
(emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). The
critical fact that was fatal to JEM's claim, the
court held, was that the hard look rules did not

change the substantive standards by which the FCC
evaluates license applications. Id. at 327. The
court recognized that the rules could result in the
loss of substantive rights, but found that they were
nonetheless procedural because they did not
foreclose effective opportunity to make one's case
on the merits. Id. at 327-28 (quoting Lamoille Valley
R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 711
F.2d 295, 328 (D.C.Cir.1983)).
While we do not purport to set forth a definitive
rule for distinguishing between substance and
procedure in this case, we conclude that the Final
Rules challenged in this case are procedural. In essence,
they govern the timing of and materials that
must be submitted with patent applications. The Final
Rules may alter the manner in which the
parties present ... their viewpoints to the USPTO,
but they do not, on their face, foreclose effective
opportunity to present patent applications for examination.
JEM, 22 F.3d at 326, 328.
Final Rules 78 and 114 provide requirements
for when continuation applications will be accepted
and RCEs will be granted. The D.C. Circuit has recognized
time schedules as being definitely at the
procedural end of a spectrum running from
procedural to substantive.  Lamoille, 711 F.2d
at 328. Applicants who include in each continuation
application all amendments, arguments, and evidence
available at the time of filing will not be limited
by Final Rule 78. Similarly, applicants who diligently
present all of their amendments, arguments,
and evidence as soon as possible during prosecution
will be granted as many RCEs as they require.
Thus, applications that are submitted in compliance
with these timing requirements will be fully examined
and given all of the benefits provided by the
Patent Act. See JEM, 22 F.3d at 327. We do not believe
that requiring applicants to raise all then-
available amendments, arguments, and evidence by
the second continuation application or the first RCE
is so significant a burden that applicants will be effectively
foreclosed from obtaining the patent rights
to which they are entitled. See Lamoille, 711 F.2d
at 328.
We are of course aware that the impact of Final
Rules 78 and 114 will be largely dependent on how
the USPTO interprets when amendments, arguments,
and evidence could not have been submitted
during the prosecution of the prior-filed application
or prior to the close of prosecution. 37
C.F.R.  1.78, 1.114(g). When the Final Rules
were published, the USPTO also published responses
to questions raised during the notice and
comment proceedings, many of which addressed
specific scenarios under which continuation applications
and RCEs may be requested. See, e.g., 72
Fed.Reg. at 46,769-77. The district court relied on
the contents of these responses to conclude that the
USPTO intends to deny additional applications in
almost all circumstances such that Final Rules 78
and 114 are in fact hard limits on continuation
applications and RCEs. Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at
814-16. Appellees and several amici encourage us
to adopt this analysis. However, we decline to rely
on these responses, which are not binding on *1357
the USPTO and often either state that decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis or speak in
terms of whether it is likely or unlikely that a
petition will be granted, to justify a decision that
the Final Rules, as actually codified in the Code of
Federal Regulations, are facially invalid. These responses
are not binding on the courts, which will be
free to entertain challenges to the USPTO's application
of the Final Rules, including its view of when
amendments, arguments, and evidence could not
have been submitted earlier, under the standard set
forth in 5 U.S.C.  706.
With respect to the ESD requirement, Final
Rules 75 and 265 require applicants who present
more than five independent claims or twenty-five
total claims to provide the examiner with information
about the prior art and why they believe the
claims are patentable over it. Once a satisfactory
ESD is submitted, examination will proceed in precisely
the same manner as it would have in the absence
of the rule. It is important to note that an ex

559 F.3d 1345, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
aminer is not permitted to substantively reject
claims on grounds that the ESD did not prove that
the claims are patentable. While an examiner is of
course free to base a rejection on references disclosed
in the ESD, he must nevertheless set forth
his own prima facie case of unpatentability. Thus,
while the rule may put a burden of production on
the applicant, the examiner maintains the burden of
persuasion.
This court has previously recognized the validity
of two USPTO rules that place upon applicants
the burden of submitting information in response to
an examiner's request. See Star Fruits, 393 F.3d at
1282-84 (Rule 105); see also In re Epstein, 32 F.3d
1559, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1994) (Plager, J., concurring) (
Rule 56). Rather than arguing that Rules 56 and
105 are invalid, Appellees attempt to distinguish
them from the Final Rules because they only pertain
to information that is already known by or
readily available to the applicant. GlaxoSmithKline
Br. 48. While we recognize this difference, we decline
to draw the line between procedure and substance
on these grounds alone. A procedural rule
does not become substantive simply because it requires
the applicant to exert more effort to comply,
so long as the effort required is not so great that it
effectively forecloses the possibility of compliance.
See Lamoille, 711 F.2d at 328.
Appellees and amici argue that the ESD requirement
is in fact so draconian that compliance
would be both impossible and extraordinarily foolish.
With respect to impossibility, Appellees argue
that Rule 265 requires a world-wide search of prior
art without regard to scope, time, or cost.
GlaxoSmithKline Br. 46. We do not find such a requirement
on the face of Final Rule 265. Rather, the
rule describes a preexamination search of U.S. patents
and patent application publications, foreign
patent documents, and non-patent literature, and
requests specific details about the scope of the
search. 37 C.F.R.  1.265(a)-(b). The text of the
rule does not demand that the applicant review
every reference that fits into one of those categor
ies, regardless of its location or accessibility. Instead,
it requires applicants to conduct and document
a search. A search of non-patent literature
does not necessarily require a visit to every
library in every corner of the world. A reasonable,
cost-effective search is just as much a search as
the search described by Appellees. While the text of
the rules sets forth a facially reasonable procedural
FN5
requirement,we are mindful of the possibility
*1358 that the USPTO may in some cases attempt
to apply the rules in a way that makes compliance
essentially impossible and substantively deprives
applicants of their rights. In such cases, judicial review
will be available under 5 U.S.C.  706.
FN5. To the extent the USPTO has commented
about its intended application of
the ESD requirement, either in public
speeches or in the Federal Register, we
make the same observation made above:
these comments do not bind the USPTO
with respect to its future actions, and they
do not affect the courts' ability to resolve
challenges to specific applications of the
rules.
Search scope aside, several amici argue that
submitting an ESD is so wrought with peril that
sane applicants will be absolutely limited to five independent
claims and twenty-five total claims.
These arguments have two components. The first is
that even the most diligently prepared ESD will inevitably
open the applicant to inequitable conduct
allegations that will entail costly litigation and a
possible finding of unenforceability. We believe
this concern is too speculative to void the rules and,
in any event, is at its core a matter of inequitable
conduct doctrine, not USPTO rulemaking authority.
The reach of inequitable conduct is solely within
the control of the courts, and the doctrine has obviously
not yet been applied in the context of an ESD.
We decline to decide that an otherwise valid
USPTO rule that requires applicants to provide information
is void because this court might in the future
apply inequitable conduct doctrine in such a
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
way that honest applicants who comply in good
faith will nevertheless lose their patent rights. Under
Kingsdown Medical Consultants, Ltd., v. Hollister,
Inc.,  gross negligence does not of itself
justify an inference of intent to deceive. 863 F.2d
867, 876 (Fed.Cir.1988) (en banc in relevant part).
We recognize that the drafting of an ESD will entail
browsing many references, that mistakes and omissions
will inevitably occur, and that the courts will
be asked to determine if there was inequitable conduct.
However, doubt about the judiciary's ability to
apply its own doctrine in a way that yields fair results
and discourages frivolous allegations should
not preclude the USPTO from promulgating rules
that are within its statutory authority.
Second, several amici argue that ESDs will decrease
the value of patent rights because the statements
therein will limit claim scope through prosecution
history estoppel. We do not believe applicants
have a right to remain silent throughout prosecution
in order to maximize their advantage in
later litigation. The Patent Act demonstrates that
applicants are expected to be forthright about their
inventions. Section 112 requires applicants to
provide a written description of the invention, and
of the manner and process of making and using it,
in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art ... to make and
use the same. 35 U.S.C.  112,  1 (emphasis added).
It also requires the application to conclude
with one or more claims particularly pointing out
and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the
applicant regards as his invention. Id.  112,  2
(emphasis added). This court has recognized that
[a]pplicants for patents have a duty to prosecute
patent applications in the Patent Office with candor,
good faith, and honesty. See Honeywell Int'l Inc. v.
Universal Avionics Sys. Corp., 488 F.3d 982, 999
(Fed.Cir.2007). We are aware that some applicants
attempt to say as little as possible during prosecution
so that the precise boundaries of their claims
will be open to argument as competitors' products
enter the market and new prior art references are
found during litigation. However, we consider this
practice to be a burden on the patent system, not a
right that can be invoked to void the Final Rules.
*1359 Having concluded our discussion of why
the Final Rules are procedural, it is important to
note one way in which our substantive/procedural
analysis differs from that of the district court.
While the district court initially stated that it need
not decide whether the Final Rules run contrary to
the Act's provisions, it did just that throughout its
discussion of the substantive nature of the rules.
Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 811 n. 4, 814-17. The
district court in large part based its conclusion that
the Final Rules are substantive on grounds that they
deprived applicants of rights guaranteed by various
sections of the Patent Act. Id. at 814-17. Because,
as discussed above, we do not believe the test the
district court distilled from Chrysler-whether the
rules affect individual rights and obligations-is
correct, we similarly conclude that consistency with
the Patent Act is not the touchstone of whether the
rules are procedural or substantive. For example, 37
C.F.R.  1.52(a)(1)(i) requires most documents submitted
to the USPTO to be printed on white paper.
No one would dispute that this rule is procedural. If
Congress then created a new section of the Patent
Act that required all documents to be printed on
yellow paper,  1.52(a)(1)(i) would certainly become
invalid. However, the reason for its invalidity
would be that it is inconsistent with an express provision
of the Act, not that the new statute transformed
it from a procedural rule into a substantive
one. Similarly, the USPTO's determination at issue
in Merck was found to be substantive without
regard to whether it conflicted with existing law.
See 80 F.3d at 1550. Therefore, we find it necessary
to separate the question of whether the Final Rules
are procedural from the question of their consistency
with the Patent Act. Having addressed the
former, we now turn to the district court's view of
the latter.
C. Consistency with the Patent Act

district court identified and relied upon in its opin

ion. Because each of the rules is procedural, we
must, as discussed above, give Chevron deference
to the USPTO's interpretation of the provisions of
the Patent Act that relate to proceedings in the Office.
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337. For such
provisions, we must first determine whether Congress
has directly spoken to the precise question at
issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the
end of the matter; for the court, as well as the
agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed
intent of Congress. Chevron, 467 U.S. at
842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. [I]f the statute is silent or
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the
question for the court is whether the agency's answer
is based on a permissible construction of the
statute. Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Even if a court
has previously resolved the specific question at issue,
the agency's construction must be adopted unless
the prior court decision holds that its construction
follows from the unambiguous terms of
the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.
Brand X, 545 U.S. at 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688.
1. Final Rule 78
The district court found that Final Rule 78's requirement
for the third and subsequent continuation
applications was inconsistent with the text of 35
U.S.C.  120 and this court's precedent. Section 120
, with emphasis and bracketed enumeration added,
provides that:
An application for patent for [1] an invention disclosed
in the manner provided by the first paragraph
of section 112 of this title in an application
previously filed in the United States, or as
provided by section 363 of this title, which is [2]
*1360 filed by an inventor or inventors named in
the previously filed application shall have the
same effect, as to such invention, as though filed
on the date of the prior application, [3] if filed
before the patenting or abandonment of or termination
of proceedings on [3a] the first application
or on [3b] an application similarly entitled to
the benefit of the filing date of the first application
and [4] if it contains or is amended to con
tain a specific reference to the earlier filed application.
No application shall be entitled to the benefit
of an earlier filed application under this section
unless an amendment containing the specific
reference to the earlier filed application is submitted
at such time during the pendency of the
application as required by the Director. The Director
may consider the failure to submit such an
amendment within that time period as a waiver of
any benefit under this section. The Director may
establish procedures, including the payment of a
surcharge, to accept an unintentionally delayed
submission of an amendment under this section.
The district court concluded that Final Rule 78
was inconsistent with the statutory mandate that
qualifying applications shall have the benefit of
the priority date of the initial application. Tafas II,
541 F.Supp.2d at 814. Additionally, the district
court cited this court's predecessor for the propositions
that there is no statutory basis for fixing an
arbitrary limit to the number of [continuing] applications,
id. (quoting In re Henriksen, 55 C.C.P.A.
1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254 (1968)) (alteration
provided by the district court), and that a limit
upon continuing applications is a matter of policy
for the Congress, id. (quoting In re Hogan, 559
F.2d 595, 604 n. 13 (CCPA 1977)). In light of the
USPTO's presumed inten[t] to deny additional applications
in almost all circumstances, the district
court found that Final Rule 78 set forth a
mechanical rule that changes existing law and
deprives applicants of their valuable rights under 35
U.S.C.  120 to an unlimited number of continuation
and continuation-in-part applications as a
matter of right. Id. at 815.
We agree with the district court that Final Rule
78 is inconsistent with  120, although we rely on
narrower grounds. Section 120 unambiguously
states that an application that meets four requirements
shall have the same effect, as to such invention,
as though filed on the date of the prior application.
35 U.S.C.  120 (emphasis added). These
requirements, which correspond to the bracketed

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
enumeration above, include [1] the invention
claimed in the application must have been properly
disclosed in a prior-filed application; [2] the application
must have been filed by inventor(s) named on
the prior-filed application; [3] the application must
have been filed before the patenting or abandonment
of or termination of proceedings on the first
application or on an application similarly entitled to
the benefit of the filing date of the first application;
and [4] the application must contain or be
amended to contain a specific reference to the prior-
filed application. The use of shall indicates
that these are the exclusive requirements, and that
all applications that meet these requirements must
receive the benefit provided by  120. See Transco
Prods., Inc. v. Performance Contracting, Inc., 38
F.3d 551, 556 (Fed.Cir.1994) (The plain and unambiguous
meaning of section 120 is that any application
fulfilling the requirements therein shall
have the same effect as if filed on the date of the
application upon which it claims priority.). Thus,
Rule 78 is invalid because it attempts to add an additional
requirement-that the application not contain
amendments, arguments, or evidence that could
have been submitted earlier-that is foreclosed by
the statute. Because the statute is clear and unambiguous
with respect to *1361 this issue, the
USPTO's reliance on Chevron and Brand X is unavailing.
As amici, several intellectual property and administrative
law professors argue that Henriksen
expressly recognized ambiguity in  120. Accordingly,
they argue, the USPTO's interpretation is entitled
to deference under Brand X. We agree that
the Henriksen court's approach of delving into the
legislative history, which it noted was somewhat
inconclusive, indicates that the text of the statute
contains some ambiguity. See Henriksen, 399 F.2d
at 256-58. However, the issue in Henriksen was
whether there was a limit to the number of prior
applications through which a chain of copendency
may be traced to obtain the benefit of the filing date
of the earliest of a chain of copending applications.
Id. at 254. In other words, the question re
lated to the permissible length of a chain of serial
continuation applications, not the total number of
continuation applications that may be filed. Specifically,
the dispute was over the meaning of
clause [3b] identified above-an application similarly
entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the
first application. Id. at 260-61. The ambiguity in
clause [3b], however, cannot save Final Rule 78.
The Final Rule limits continuation applications on
the basis of the total number of such applications
previously filed, not on the length of a given serial
chain of such applications. 37 C.F.R.
1.78(d)(1)(i)(B). By its terms, Final Rule 78 would
apply to an applicant who seeks to file three continuation
applications while the first application is
still pending, even though each of these applications
falls squarely within clause [3a] and would
thus satisfy any reasonable interpretation of clause
[3] and the rest of  120. Therefore, while we must
defer to the USPTO's reasonable interpretation of
clause [3], there is no such interpretation that preserves
the validity of Final Rule 78.
Finally, the USPTO's reliance on In re Bogese,
303 F.3d 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002), is unavailing. In
Bogese, this court affirmed the Board of Patent Appeals
and Interferences's rejection of claims in the
applicant's continuation application on the grounds
of extraordinary delay in prosecution. 303 F.3d at
1366. The applicant had submitted twelve continuation
applications over an eight-year period and did
not substantively advance prosecution of [the application
at issue] when required and given an opportunity
to do so. Id. at 1369. According to the
USPTO, Bogese forecloses any argument that the
conditions enumerated in Section 120 for making a
priority claim are exclusive. USPTO Br. 45. This
is so, it contends, because the opinion recognized
that [t]he PTO has inherent authority to govern
procedure before the PTO, and that authority allows
it to set reasonable deadlines and requirements for
the prosecution of applications. Bogese, 303 F.3d
at 1368. We do not read the opinion so broadly.
The holding of Bogese was that the PTO has authority
to order forfeiture of rights for unreasonable

delay. Id. at 1369. However, Bogese does not extend
that power beyond the boundaries of prosecution
history laches, which was upheld as an equitable
defense to infringement in Symbol Technologies,
Inc. v. Lemelson Medical, 277 F.3d 1361
(Fed.Cir.2002) ( Symbol II ). Rather, the panel recognized
that the PTO has the authority to reject
patent applications for patents that would be unenforceable
under our holding in [ Symbol II].
Bogese, 303 F.3d at 1367. We agree that the
USPTO has inherent authority to govern procedure
before the PTO, and that authority allows it to set
reasonable deadlines and requirements for the prosecution
of applications. Id. at 1368. However, under
Bogese, the USPTO cannot set requirements
that conflict with  120 unless those requirements
comport with a proper application*1362 of prosecution
history laches. There are no firm guidelines
for determining when prosecution laches exists.
Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Lemelson Med. Educ. & Research
Found., 422 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed.Cir.2005)
( Symbol IV ). However, it is limited to cases of
unreasonable and unexplained delay in prosecution.
Id. at 1384-85. We need not address the precise
boundaries of the USPTO's authority to promulgate
rules under Bogese because Final Rule 78
is far too restrictive to fall within the scope of prosecution
history laches. The rule operates on an applicant's
third continuation application without regard
to when it was filed, even if the delay is significantly
shorter than any of the delays in our prior
prosecution history laches cases. See, e.g., Symbol
IV, 422 F.3d at 1386 (eighteen to thirty-nine years
elapsed between filing and issuance); Bogese, 303
F.3d at 1369 (eight years without the applicant substantively
advancing prosecution). The rule simply
captures too many applications that would not be
even remotely susceptible to a prosecution history
laches challenge. Therefore, Final Rule 78 is not a
proper use of the USPTO's authority under Bogese
to apply prosecution history laches.
2. Final Rule 114
The district court found that Final Rule 114,
which governs the availability of RCEs, conflicts
with the Patent Act in two ways. The first was that
it places a limit on RCEs as of right on the basis of
application family, rather than on the basis of each
individual application, whether it be a parent application
or a continuation or continuation-in-part
application. Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 815. The
district court found that this was inconsistent with
35 U.S.C.  132, which uses the singular form of
application. Additionally, the court noted Congress's
pronouncement, upon enacting Section
132(b), that the RCE provisions shall apply to all
applications' filed on or after June 8, 1995. Id.
(quoting American Inventors Protection Act of
1999, Pub.L. No. 106-113,  4405(b)(1), 113 Stat.
1501, 1501A-560 to 1501A-561 (1999)). Second,
the court found that  132(b)'s mandate that [t]he
director shall prescribe regulations to provide for
the continued examination of applications for patent
at the request of the applicant gave applicants
the right to an unlimited number of RCEs per application
at their discretion. Id. This right, the
court held, was violated by Final Rule 114. Id.
We do not find that  132 unambiguously dictates
that its provisions be applied on a per application
basis. Cf. Henriksen, 399 F.2d at 258 (So
read, an application does not necessarily refer
only to a single application.); 1 U.S.C.  1
([W]ords importing the singular include and apply
to several persons, parties, or things....). Therefore,
because we defer to the USPTO's reasonable
interpretation of the statute, we conclude that Final
Rule 114 can properly be applied on a per family
basis. See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38.
Appellees next argue that the use of shall in
conjunction with the phrase at the request of the
applicant in  132(b) clearly shows that Congress
intended RCEs to be unlimited and subject only to
the applicant's discretion. GlaxoSmithKline Br. 40.
We do not find the statute so clear. It is plausible
that, as the USPTO suggests,  132(b) simply directs
the USPTO to prescribe regulations to govern
the applicant's ability to request continued examination
which must, in some circumstances, be

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
granted. Under this reading, nothing prevents the
USPTO from limiting the availability of the second
and subsequent RCEs. Because  132(b) does not
unambiguously require the USPTO to grant unlimited
RCEs, we defer to the *1363 USPTO's interpretation.
See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38.
Finally, Appellees argue that  132(a) requires
the USPTO to continue examination if the applicant
persists in his claim for a patent. Tafas Br.
32-33. Section 132(a) provides:
Whenever, on examination, any claim for a patent
is rejected, or any objection or requirement
made, the Director shall notify the applicant
thereof, stating the reasons for such rejection, or
objection or requirement, together with such information
and references as may be useful in
judging of the propriety of continuing the prosecution
of his application; and if after receiving
such notice, the applicant persists in his claim for
a patent, with or without amendment, the application
shall be reexamined. No amendment shall
introduce new matter into the disclosure of the
invention.
35 U.S.C.  132(a) (emphases added). The
USPTO responds that this argument reflects a misunderstanding
of the relationship between subsections
(a) and (b) [of  132]. USPTO Br. 53. According
to the USPTO, [s]ubsection (a) provides
for the reexamination of an application at the applicant's
request after the initial examination
provided in section 131. In contrast, continued examination
under subsection (b) occurs after the
reexamination provided for in subsection (a) is
complete. Id. Section 132 does not define the difference
between continued examination and
reexamination. Because we find the USPTO's explanation
reasonable, we defer to its interpretation
that  132(a) does not require it to grant unlimited
RCEs. See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1337-38.
Under this interpretation, Final Rule 114 does not
conflict with  132(a).
3. Final Rules 75 and 265
The district court held that the ESD requirement violated
35 U.S.C.  102, 103, 112, and 131, as well
as this court's precedent that holds that applicants
have no duty to search the prior art. The court
began its analysis with  112,  2's requirement that
[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more
claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards
as his invention. The district court held, and
Appellees argue on appeal, that this language precludes
the USPTO from putting an arbitrary limit
on the number of claims in an application.
Subject to the arguable requirement that an applicant
cannot obscure his invention by undue
multiplicity, our precedent does not suggest that
there is a limit on the number of claims. In re
Clark, 25 C.C.P.A. 1317, 97 F.2d 628, 631 (1938);
see also In re Wakefield, 57 C.C.P.A. 959, 422 F.2d
897, 900 (1970) ([A]n applicant should be allowed
to determine the necessary number and scope of his
claims....); In re Chandler, 50 C.C.P.A. 1422, 319
F.2d 211, 225 (1963) ([A]pplicants should be allowed
reasonable latitude in stating their claims in
regard to number and phraseology employed. The
right of applicants to freedom of choice in selecting
phraseology which truly points out and defines their
inventions should not be abridged.). However, we
need not decide whether the USPTO may impose a
limit on the number of claims an applicant can pursue
because we do not find that the ESD requirement
creates any such limit. Rather, it simply requires
that an ESD be submitted if more than five
independent or twenty-five total claims are included
in certain sets of copending applications.
Because we cannot, as discussed above, conclude
that Final Rules 75 and 265, on their face, effectively
foreclose applicants from successfully submitting
ESDs, we similarly cannot conclude that these
rules place an absolute *1364 limit on claim numbers
in violation of  112,  2.
The district court also found that Final Rules
75 and 265 went too far by requiring applicants to
conduct a broad search of patents, patent applica

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
tions, and literature, and provide, among other
things, a detailed explanation of how each of the
independent claims is patentable over the cited references.
Tafas II, 541 F.Supp.2d at 816 (quoting
37 C.F.R.  1.265(a)). The court relied on several
of this court's inequitable conduct cases that noted
that, in general, there is no duty to conduct a prior
art search. Frazier v. Roessel Cine Photo Tech.,
Inc., 417 F.3d 1230, 1238 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting
FMC Corp. v. Hennessy Indus., Inc., 836 F.2d 521,
526 n. 6 (Fed.Cir.1987)); see also Bruno Indep.
Living Aids, Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs., Ltd., 394
F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 4 (Fed.Cir.2005). We agree with
the USPTO that these cases do not speak to whether
the USPTO may impose such a duty by regulation.
Indeed, this court has already upheld the USPTO's
authority to require from applicants such information
as may be reasonably necessary to properly examine
or treat the matter. 37 C.F.R.  1.105; see
also Star Fruits, 393 F.3d at 1282-84. On this record,
we see no persuasive reason to prohibit the
USPTO from requesting the information required
by Final Rule 265, even if the applicant must take
action to acquire that information.
Finally, the district court found that Final Rules
75 and 265 improperly shift the burden away from
the examiner and onto the applicant. Tafas II, 541
F.Supp.2d at 817. The court relied on the language
in  102 that [a] person shall be entitled to a patent
unless, along with the requirement in  131 that
[t]he director shall cause an examination to be
made of the application. Id. Additionally, the district
court noted that this court's precedent places
the burden of putting forth a prima facie case of unpatentability
on the USPTO. See In re Oetiker, 977
F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed.Cir.1992). We agree with the
district court that the USPTO bears the initial burden
of proving unpatentability, but disagree that the
ESD requirement shifts that burden. Final Rules 75
and 265 do not require an applicant to make a
prima facie case of patentability. While the rules require
an applicant to conduct a prior art search and
report his view of why the invention is patentable
based on the results, the content of this disclosure
does not change the standards by which the application
is examined. An examiner cannot reject an application
because he believes that the applicant
failed to find the most material references or if he is
otherwise not persuaded by the applicant's view of
the prior art. Even under the new rules, the examiner
must examine the application in accordance
with  131 and the applicant will be entitled to a
patent unless the examiner can make a prima facie
case of unpatentability. 35 U.S.C.  102. Thus,
while creating an additional procedural step for the
submission of applications, the ESD requirement
does not alter the ultimate burdens of the examiner
or applicant during examination.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the
Final Rules 75, 78, 114, and 265 are procedural
rules that are within the scope of the USPTO's rule-
making authority. However, we find that Final Rule
78 conflicts with 35 U.S.C.  120 and is thus invalid.
Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant
of summary judgment that Final Rule 78 is invalid,
vacate its grant of summary judgment with respect
to Final Rules 75, 114, and 265, and remand for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
*1365 Because of the complexity of this case
and the numerous arguments presented on appeal
and before the district court, we think it is important
to expressly summarize what we believe remains
for the district court on remand. This opinion
does not decide any of the following issues: whether
any of the Final Rules, either on their face or as
applied in any specific circumstances, are arbitrary
and capricious; whether any of the Final Rules conflict
with the Patent Act in ways not specifically addressed
in this opinion; whether all USPTO rule-
making is subject to notice and comment rulemaking
under 5 U.S.C.  553; whether any of the Final
Rules are impermissibly vague; and whether the Final
Rules are impermissibly retroactive.

AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART,
AND REMANDED
BRYSON, Circuit Judge, concurring.
I join Judge Prost's opinion but with the following
observations.
1. In my view, the question whether the PTO is
authorized to promulgate particular regulations
does not turn on an abstract inquiry into whether a
particular rule can be characterized as substantive,
procedural, or interpretive. Instead, it calls on us to
ask what Congress has empowered the PTO to do
through rulemaking. Congress has not used the
broadest available language in the statute that authorizes
the PTO to engage in rulemaking, but
neither has it used the narrowest. Congress could
have authorized the PTO to issue any regulations
that are necessary or appropriate to administer the
patent laws. See, e.g., 38 U.S.C.  501 (Secretary of
Veterans Affairs authorized to prescribe all rules
and regulations which are necessary or appropriate
to carry out the laws administered by the Department);
5 U.S.C.  8347(a) (Office of Personnel
Management given authority to prescribe such regulations
as are necessary and proper to carry out
[the Civil Service Retirement Act]). Language of
that sort would have given the PTO the very broad
rulemaking authority. On the other hand, the PTO
could have given no special authority to promulgate
regulations, which would have had the effect of
limiting the PTO to the narrow scope of 5 U.S.C.
301, which allows all agencies to prescribe regulations
for the government of ... [the] department,
the conduct of its employees, the distribution and
performance of its business, and the custody, use,
and preservation of its records, papers, and property.
Congress did neither. Instead, it charted a
middle course in 35 U.S.C.  2(b), permitting the
agency somewhat broader regulatory powers than
are contemplated by section 301, but narrower than
the broad necessary or appropriate rulemaking
authority given to some other agencies.
Section 2(b)(2)(A) of the Patent Act vests the
PTO with authority to promulgate regulations that
govern the conduct of proceedings in the Office.
The subject matter that most clearly falls within the
scope of that provision is the admission and discipline
of attorneys practicing before the PTO. See,
e.g., Bender v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368
(Fed.Cir.2007); Lacavera v. Dudas, 441 F.3d 1380,
1383 (Fed.Cir.2006). Even apart from that context,
however, we have taken a fairly expansive view of
the scope of section 2(b)(2)(A). For example, in In
re Sullivan, we held that section 2(b)(2)(A) authorized
the PTO to promulgate a regulation permitting
conferences between an administrative patent judge
and the parties to an interference proceeding. 362
F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2004). Also in the interference
context, we held in Stevens v. Tamai that
the PTO acted within its authority under *1366section
2(b)(2)(A) when it promulgated regulations establishing
that the movant has the burden of proof
and duty of translating earlier filed documents into
English, so as to show that the international application
contains the same disclosure as the national
stage application. 366 F.3d 1325, 1332
(Fed.Cir.2004). Finally, in Cooper Technologies
Co. v. Dudas, we held that the PTO was entitled to
promulgate a regulation defining the term original
application in a statutory provision that established
the procedures for inter partes reexamination, and
that the regulation was entitled to Chevron deference.
536 F.3d 1330, 1336-38 (Fed.Cir.2008).
For essentially the reasons given by the majority
opinion and in light of the above-cited authorities,
I am satisfied that the regulations in this case
are of the type that Congress authorized in section
2(b) of the Patent Act, as that provision has been
construed by this court. While I think it is generally
fair to characterize that statute as authorizing the
promulgation of procedural regulations, however,
I do not think it necessary, or particularly helpful,
to consider whether those regulations would be
deemed substantive, interpretive, or
procedural either under section 4 of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  553, or under statutory
schemes applicable to other agencies.

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
The same approach seems to me to be called
for in deciding whether the agency is entitled to deference
with respect to the scope of its own authority.
There, too, the issue comes down to one of statutory
construction-whether Congress left the
boundaries of agency authority undefined and subject
to refinement through the exercise of agency
expertise, or whether Congress established a firm
line, enforceable by courts, beyond which the
agency could not venture. Normally, Congress
defines the field of agency rulemaking authority in
unambiguous terms that are readily applied by
courts, so there is little reason to resort to Chevron-
type analysis. In some instances, however, Congress
has defined the agency's rulemaking jurisdiction
using vague terms, or terms that call for agency
interpretation, or even terms that expressly leave
the scope of rulemaking authority to the agency to
decide; in those cases, deference to the agency may
be appropriate or even necessary. See, e.g., Bender
v. Dudas, 490 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2007)
(deference given to PTO's interpretation of the
phrase before the Office in section 2(b)(2));
Enercon GmbH v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 151 F.3d
1376, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir.1998) (deference given to
ITC's interpretation of the word sale in the statute
giving it jurisdiction, 15 U.S.C.  1337); 5 U.S.C.
7701(a) (authorizing Merit Systems Protection
Board to act on appeals authorized by any law,
rule, or regulation). In this case, it is unnecessary
to decide whether deference would be due to the
agency's interpretation of its own authority, as we
conclude, even without deference, that the agency
has authority to issue regulations of the sort issued
in this case, subject to their consistency with the
underlying statutory provisions being interpreted.
Because I agree with Judge Prost that the challenged
regulations are within the scope of the authorization
that Congress granted to the PTO in section
2(b), I likewise conclude that the issue in this
case comes down to whether the challenged regulations
are consistent with other provisions of the Patent
Act.
2. On the merits, the most difficult question in
this case for me is whether Final Rule 78 is a valid
regulation in light of 35 U.S.C.  120. My colleagues
conclude that it is invalid, although for different
reasons. I agree that it is invalid for the reasons
given by Judge Prost, although*1367 I think it
is important to emphasize the narrow scope of the
court's decision.
The court holds that Final Rule 78 is invalid
because it limits the number of continuation applications
that may be filed and applies that limit even
if all of the continuation applications are filed while
the first application is still pending. Section 120
plainly provides that any application that satisfies
the other requirements of the statute and is filed
before the patenting or abandonment of or termination
of proceedings on the first application shall
have the same effect as though filed on the date of
the prior application. 35 U.S.C.  120. Therefore,
a rule limiting the number of continuances co-
pending with the first-filed application is necessarily
contrary to the statute and invalid.
While that is a sufficient reason to invalidate
Final Rule 78, it does not answer the question
whether the rule is invalid as applied to serial continuances,
i.e., a series of continuances in which
each was co-pending with its immediate predecessor,
but in which only the second in the series
was co-pending with the first application. Under
current law, all continuances in such a series, if
they satisfy the other requirements of section 120,
are deemed to have the same effective date as the
first application. Rule 78 would change that practice.
The question whether the new Rule's restrictions
on serial continuances would also be invalid is
more complex than the question of the validity of
restrictions on co-pending applications. As to serial
continuances, section 120 provides that an application
for continued prosecution is entitled to the benefit
of an earlier priority date when it is co-
pending with an application similarly entitled to
the benefit of the filing date of the first applica

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
tion. For the last 40 years, that portion of section
120 has been understood to confer upon patent applicants
the right to file any number of successive
continuation applications after the first application
has been abandoned or issued as a patent. That was
the construction of section 120 that our predecessor
court adopted in 1968, overturning a Patent Office
Board of Appeals decision to the contrary. In re
Henriksen, 55 C.C.P.A. 1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254
(1968). It would not be unreasonable, however, to
construe the phrase an application similarly entitled
to mean an application that satisfies all the
preceding requirements set forth in section 120, including
the requirement of co-pendency with the
initial application, which was the construction adopted
by the Patent Office Board of Appeals in the
Henriksen case. See Ex parte Henriksen, 154
U.S.P.Q. 53 (1966). In fact, the court in Henriksen
acknowledged that a literal reading of the statutory
language would lead to that conclusion. In re Henriksen,
399 F.2d at 256, 260-61 & n. 18. Under that
interpretation, applicants would be limited to a
maximum of two continuations in series-one while
the first application is pending and another while
the first continuation is pending. Because the term
similarly entitled admits of two reasonable constructions,
the PTO could have adopted the narrower
construction notwithstanding prior judicial precedent
construing the statute in the absence of a
regulation interpreting the statutory language. See
Nat'l Cable & Telecomms. Assn' v. Brand X Internet
Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 982-86, 125 S.Ct. 2688,
162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005).
The court today properly strikes down Final
Rule 78 because its restrictions on co-pending, or
parallel, continuations is contrary to the plain language
of section 120, which provides that such a
co-pending continuation shall be given the same
priority date as the original application and which
contains no restriction on the numbers of such applications
that are permitted. That is not to say,
however, that a revised rule that addressed only
serial continuances*1368 and limited such continuances
to only two-the first co-pending with the ori
ginal application and the second co-pending with
the first-would be struck down as reflecting an impermissible
interpretation of section 120. That is
not a question that we need to-or should-decide
today, but in my view it is important to emphasize
that the question remains open.
RADER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting
in part.
I concur with this court's conclusion that the
PTO is not entitled to Chevron deference with respect
to its own rulemaking authority. However, in
my view, the Final Rules are substantive, not procedural.
Thus, I would affirm the district court's
conclusion that the PTO exceeded its statutory rule-
making authority in promulgating these rules. For
that reason, I concur in part with this court's ultimate
conclusion regarding Final Rule 78, but dissent
in part with respect to Final Rules 114, 75, and
265.
This case presents a threshold question about
the nature of these rules-substantive or procedural.
The organic act of the PTO does NOT grant the
Commissioner the authority to issue substantive
rules. Merck & Co. v. Kessler, 80 F.3d 1543, 1550
(Fed.Cir.1996) (emphasis in original). Unlike
grants of rulemaking authority to many other administrative
agencies, the PTO does not enjoy substantive
rulemaking authority. Accordingly, the legislative
branch has retained the responsibility for
developing substantive patent law. To the extent
that the PTO's Final Rules are substantive, this
court cannot permit the PTO to exceed its authority.
The distinction between substantive or non-
substantive rules requires a difficult judgment. This
distinction arises most often in the context of interpreting
the exception to the requirement for notice
and comment procedures in the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA). 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(A). In the
most common scenario, an agency has promulgated
a rule without undergoing the strictures of notice
and comment rulemaking. The reviewing court
must then, when necessary, apply the APA's exemption
for interpretative rules, general statements

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure,
or practice. Id. In other words, the courts may
only sustain non-substantive rulemaking in those
cases. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Quigg,
932 F.2d 920 (Fed.Cir.1991); JEM Broad. Co. v.
FCC, 22 F.3d 320 (D.C.Cir.1994); Am. Hosp. Ass'n
v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037 (D.C.Cir.1987). These
cases have set forth a balancing test to identify a
non-substantive rule: a rule is sufficiently non-
substantive where the policies promoted by public
participation in rulemaking are outweighed by the
countervailing considerations of effectiveness, efficiency,
expedition and reduction in expense.
Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Fed. Sav. &
Loan Ins. Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 662 (D.C.Cir.1978).
The instant case, however, presents a different
situation. These PTO rules have no procedural defects.
Instead, this case asks this court to ensure that
the PTO has not exceeded its rulemaking authority.
Thus, in the present context, this court misapplies
the teachings of cases such as Animal Legal Defense
Fund and Cooper Technologies Co. v. Dudas,
536 F.3d 1330 (Fed.Cir.2008). These cases focus
on the distinction between interpretative and
substantive rules. Parsing the difference between
interpretive, procedural, and policy rules
may be relevant in the context of categorizing a
rule into one of the APA's exceptions to notice and
comment rulemaking, but has no relevance to the
question of exceeding a grant of rulemaking authority.
In the unique context of this case, it makes no
sense to classify a *1369 rule as procedural or
interpretative. Either of those labels leads to the
same conclusion-that the rule is non-substantive.
See Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336 (finding the
PTO's interpretation of original application in 35
U.S.C.  4608 to be procedural within the meaning
of 35 U.S.C.  2(b)(2) because it was
interpretative ... rather than substantive ); see
also Animal Legal Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927
(contrasting substantive rules with the general
category of exempt interpretative rules of section
553(b)). Thus, I would not so casually discard, as
this court does today, this court's precedent for
identifying a substantive rule.
The Supreme Court provided valuable guidance
on the substantive/nonsubstantive inquiry in
Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct.
1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). In Chrysler, the
Court defined an inherent characteristic of a
substantive or legislative-type rule, namely,
such rules affect [ ] individual rights and obligations.
Id. at 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705. Contrary to this
court's analysis today, the Chrysler Court's reasoning
was in no way limited to defining the boundary
between interpretative and substantive rules. The
Court sought to draw a broad distinction between
substantive and non-substantive rules-the same inquiry
presented in this case. Id. Shedding light on
this distinction, the Court recognized that [a]
substantive rule is not defined in the APA, but
that the term is best defined by negative inference.
Id. at 301-02, 99 S.Ct. 1705 (emphasis added).
Put differently, a rule is substantive if it is not an
interpretive rule[ ], general statement[ ] of policy,
or rule[ ] of agency organization, procedure, or
practice. Id. at 301, 99 S.Ct. 1705.
Both this court and the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit have relied on
Chrysler in building a body of jurisprudence germane
to the substantive/nonsubstantive inquiry.
Central to this jurisprudence is the recognition that
classifying a rule as substantive or non-substantive
is a case-by-case exercise, poorly suited for bright-
line rules. See, e.g., Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1045
(Determining whether a given agency action is interpretive
or legislative is an extraordinarily case-
specific endeavor.... [A]nalogizing to prior cases is
often of limited utility in light of the exceptional
degree to which decisions in this doctrinal area turn
on their precise facts.); Chamber of Commerce v.
Dep't of Labor, 174 F.3d 206, 212 (D.C.Cir.1999)
([T]he question whether a rule is substantive or
procedural for the purposes of  553(b) is functional,
not formal.).

a rule affects individual rights and obligations-if

analyzed in a vacuum, would blur the line between
substantive and non-substantive rules. See, e.g.,
Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1046 ([T]he mere fact that a
rule may have a substantial impact does not transform
it into a legislative rule.); Neighborhood TV
Co. v. FCC, 742 F.2d 629, 637 (D.C.Cir.1984)
([E]very change in rules will have some effect on
those regulated.) (internal quotation marks omitted).
For this reason, as the D.C. Circuit stated in
JEM, the critical feature of a procedural, non-
substantive rule is that it covers agency actions
that do not themselves alter the rights or interests of
parties, although it may alter the manner in which
the parties present themselves or their viewpoints to
the agency. JEM, 22 F.3d at 326. Although the
court's opinion today seizes upon this instructive
language from JEM, it sadly overlooks JEM's ensuing
statement: [t]he issue, therefore, is one of degree
... our task is to identify which substantive effects
are sufficiently grave .... Id. at 327 (emphases
added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Assessing
the challenged *1370 FCC rule's impact, which
merely curtailed a license applicant's right to a
free shot at amending its application, the court in
JEM concluded that the rule was not so significant
as to be classified as substantive. Id. (emphasis
added). Thus, as JEM illustrates, the test for substantive,
ultra vires rules is a case-by-case inquiry,
not a rigid application of a sentence out of context
in JEM.
To my eyes, this question of degree must guide
this court's assessment of the substantive nature of
the PTO's Final Rules. This court has confronted
that question before and gauged a rule's impact on
parties' rights and obligations by examining the
rules' changes to existing law or policy. See, e.g.,
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336; Animal Legal
Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927. The D.C. Circuit has
also adopted this language as relevant to the inquiry.
See, e.g., Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1045
(Substantive rules are ones which grant rights, impose
obligations, or produce other significant effects
on private interests, or which effect a change
in existing law or policy.) (internal citations and
quotation marks omitted). For example, in Cooper
Technologies, this court held that a PTO rule giving
effect to the term original application was non-
substantive because it does not effect any change
in existing law or policy; rather, it is a prospective
clarification of ambiguous statutory language regarding
a matter of procedure. 536 F.3d at 1336.
Similarly, in Bowen, a manual promulgated by the
Department of Health and Human Services was a
classic procedural rule[ ] because, in mapping
out an enforcement strategy for third party contractors,
it impose[d] no new burdens on hospitals.
Bowen, 834 F.2d at 1050-51.
The D.C. Circuit's 1999 decision in Chamber
of Commerce is particularly instructive. 174 F.3d at
206. In that case, the court considered a new directive
promulgated by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) establishing a
new compliance program for dangerous workplaces.
Id. at 208. The Directive provided that the
agency would reduce the probability of an onerous
inspection if a workplace implemented a so-called
comprehensive safety and health program
(CSHP). Id. Although [m]ost of the [CSHP] requirements
are procedural, the Directive was clear
that compliance with the Occupational Safety and
Health Act was not in itself sufficient for compliance
with the newly promulgated CSHP. Id.
Plaintiffs challenged the Directive on the ground
that it was a substantive rule, and OSHA had not
undergone the requisite notice and comment procedures.
Id. at 209. The court agreed with the
plaintiffs, holding that the rule was substantive
[a]t least to the extent that participation in the CCP
requires more than adherence to existing law.... Id.
at 211 (emphasis added). Indeed, because the Directive
imposed upon employers more than the incidental
inconveniences of complying with an enforcement
scheme, it was plainly substantive. Id.
at 211-12 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Implicit in the majority's holding that the Final
Rules are procedural is that the rules fit within the
procedural exception to the APA's notice and

comment requirement. Yet applying this logic, the
PTO would never be subject to the APA's notice
and comment procedures because it only has statutory
authority to promulgate rules that fall within
exceptions to notice and comment, i.e., non-
substantive rules. Here, the PTO provided a notice
and comment period. In other words, the PTO recognized
that the policies promoted by public participation
in rulemaking ... outweigh[ed] ... countervailing
considerations of effectiveness, efficiency,
expedition and reduction in expense. See Guardian
Federal, 589 F.2d at 662 (providing that notice
and comment is not required*1371 when these
countervailing considerations trump public participation).
The public participation during that
period was overwhelming (itself an indication of
the substantive impact of the rules?). Many of the
comments shared a common concern: that the Final
Rules had a significant effect on private interests,
and marked a change in existing law or policy. I
share that concerned view.
II
Contrary to this court's holding today, the Final
Rules are not incidental inconveniences of complying
with an enforcement scheme. The Final
Rules are substantive. The Final Rules affect individual
rights and obligations, and mark a startling
change in existing law and patent policy. As the
district court correctly noted,
The 2+1 Rule and the 5/25 Rule, which limit continuing
applications, RCEs, and claims, and the
ESD requirement, which shifts the examination
burden onto applicants, constitute a drastic departure
from the terms of the Patent Act as they
are presently understood. By so departing, the Final
Rules effect changes in GSK's and Tafas's existing
rights and obligations.
Tafas v. Dudas, 541 F.Supp.2d 805, 814
(E.D.Va.2008) (emphasis added). I will briefly consider
each Final Rule in turn.
A. Final Rule 78
Final Rule 78 restricts to two the number of
continuation applications entitled to an earlier priority
date, unless the applicant files a petition
showing that the amendment, argument, or evidence
could not have been submitted during the prosecution
of the prior-filed application (petition and
showing). As this court notes today, that rule contravenes
the language of 35 U.S.C.  120. The statute
is clear: later filed continuation applications
shall have the same effect, as to such invention, as
though filed on the date of the prior application.
35 U.S.C.  120 (emphasis added). Final Rule 78 is
not a prospective clarification of ambiguous statutory
language regarding a matter of procedure,
Cooper Techs., 536 F.3d at 1336, because the statute
mandates that continuations shall have the
same effect. Section 120 creates a substantive
right to claim the earlier priority date in later-filed
continuation applications.
In fact, this court's predecessor considered the
language of 35 U.S.C.  120: [T]here is no statutory
basis for fixing an arbitrary limit to the number
of [continuing] applications that can retain the
benefit of the priority date. In re Henriksen, 55
C.C.P.A. 1384, 399 F.2d 253, 254 (1968). The
court recognized that placing a limit upon continuing
applications is a matter of policy for the Congress.
In re Hogan, 559 F.2d 595, 604 n. 13
(CCPA 1977). In other words, Final Rule 78 attempts
to usurp legislative prerogatives. If the Act
contemplated a limit on the number of continuation
applications available as a matter of right, then a
limitation to that effect would appear in  120. Instead
120 says the opposite.
The Office argues that Final Rule 78 is not substantive
because the petition and showing requirement
provides an alternative avenue for seeking additional
continuations. The PTO's argument admits
far too much. In order to receive the benefit of priority
for later-filed continuation applications, which
was previously available as a matter or right, the
applicant must now justify the right with further
showings. This new petition and showing hurdle
is neither required nor contemplated by  120. In

mechanically applying only one statement from
JEM, the majority opinion ignores that the
substantive effect of failing to meet this new obligation-
the loss of priority date-is sufficiently
*1372 grave to make this rule substantive. See
JEM, 22 F.3d at 327.
B. Final Rule 114
The same holds true with respect to Final Rule
114, imposing a limit of one request for continued
examination (RCE) per application family. The
American Inventor's Protection Act of 1999 stated
that the RCE provisions shall apply to all applications
filed on or after June 8, 1995. The Act did
not impose or contemplate a restrictive RCE practice.
To the contrary, subject to the doctrine of prosecution
laches, applicants could file an RCE as a
matter of right.
The impact and reach of the Final Rules 78 and
114 (the 2+1 Rule) significantly affects patent
prosecution. Several amicus briefs point out reasonable
scenarios where an applicant may choose to
file an RCE during prosecution, e.g., in order to
provoke an interference, to clarify claim scope in
anticipation of litigation, and to submit an information
disclosure statement (IDS). Yet these Final
Rules could interfere with those reasonable scenarios.
By way of example, consider the following
scenario: An applicant receives a Notice of Allowance
for application A. Before paying the issue fee,
the applicant discovers a material prior art reference
in a foreign application. Mindful of the duty to
disclose material information to the Office, that applicant
would file an RCE, an IDS citing the reference,
and an amendment to account for the newly
discovered prior art. So far so good, but what if the
reference is not only material to application A, but
also material to continuation applications B and C,
members of the same application family that have
also received Notices of Allowance? Under the 2+1
Rule, the applicant would have exhausted the two
continuations and one RCE. What happens to applications
B and C? Even if the submission of
newly-discovered prior art satisfied the petition
and showing requirement (which the PTO has said
it will likely not), the petition and showing requirement
is legislative because it imposes a new
burden on the inventor. Because they require more
than adherence to existing law, Final Rules 78 and
114 are substantive. See Chamber of Commerce,
174 F.3d at 211.
C. Final Rule 75
Final Rule 75 limits an application to five independent
claims or twenty-five claims total. Placing
an arbitrary limit on the number of claims in an application
drastically affects an applicant's rights and
obligations under the Patent Act. To be specific,
this rule alters obligations under 35 U.S.C.  102,
103, 112, and 131. For instance,  112,  2 requires
that [t]he specification shall conclude with one or
more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards
as his invention. 35 U.S.C.  112,  2
(emphasis added). Placing a mechanical cap on the
number of claims in an application hinders an applicant's
right (and obligation) to particularly
[point] out and distinctly [claim] the subject matter
which the applicant regards as his invention. Id.
Indeed, one or more claims suggests at least one,
not a ceiling to the number of claims in an application.
Once again, if the Act wished to specify an
upper limit on the number of claims, it could do so
right at this point. Instead the or more requirement
places no limit on the number of claims. The
Act instead articulates a clear policy in favor of allowing
as many claims as an applicant is willing to
pay for.
As the majority opinion acknowledges, this
court's precedent suggests no limit on the number
of claims. See *1373In re Wakefield, 57 C.C.P.A.
959, 422 F.2d 897, 900 (1970) ([A]n applicant
should be allowed to determine the necessary number
and scope of his claims....); In re Chandler, 50
C.C.P.A. 1422, 319 F.2d 211, 225 (1963)

in stating their claims in regard to number and

(Cite as: 559 F.3d 1345)
phraseology employed. The right of applicants to
freedom of choice in selecting phraseology which
truly points out and defines their inventions should
not be abridged.). This court should and does understand
that some inventions are easier to describe,
or lend themselves well to drawings. Others are
more complicated and may take several iterations
of claims in order to capture and fully disclose
one's invention.
By analogy, this rule has a similar effect to imposing
a five-page limit on applications. Although
that notion is obviously too simplistic and problematic,
this court's rationale would apparently make
that hypothetical rule possible as a procedural rule
that merely [alters] the manner in which the
parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the
agency. JEM, 22 F.3d at 326. To my eyes, much
more is at stake.
Likewise, limiting an applicant to five independent
claims ignores the varying scopes and
methods of claiming inventions across different
technologies. For example, in a pharmaceutical application,
an applicant may claim not only the
genus compound, but also a number of species, intermediates,
methods of making, and methods of
use. Asking an inventor to limit her application to
five independent claims disproportionately affects
technologies with greater complexity and greater
public interest in disclosure. See Neighborhood TV,
742 F.2d at 637 (In determining whether a rule is
substantive, we must look at its effect on those interests
ultimately at stake in the agency proceeding.).
This court today forgets that an inventor's incentive
to disclose is commensurate with the protection
available. With less ability to claim myriad
methods of making, methods of use, species and intermediates,
and more, an inventor will have less
incentive to disclose the full dimension of the technological
advance. Final Rule 75 frustrates the quid
pro quo contemplated by the Patent Act.
D. Final Rule 265
On appeal, the PTO submits that limiting an
application to five independent claims, or twenty-
five claims total, is not a mechanical limitation, but
just a trigger to the requirement to file an Examination
Support Document (ESD). Final Rule 265
goes too far, however, by requiring an applicant to
conduct a broad search of patents, patent applications,
and literature, and provide, among other
things, a detailed explanation of how each of the
independent claims is patentable over the cited references.
Tafas, 541 F.Supp.2d at 816 (quoting 37
C.F.R.  1.265(a)). Setting aside its onerous burden
and its risk to cause later allegations of inequitable
conduct, the ESD requirement improperly shifts the
burden of proving patentability onto the applicant-a
direct conflict with this court's interpretation of section
102.
Section 102 provides [a] person shall be entitled
to a patent unless  and section 131 provides
that [t]he director shall cause an examination to be
made of the application. 35 U.S.C.  102, 131.
Thus, the PTO bears the burden of putting forth a
prima facie case of unpatentability. See In re Oetiker,
977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed.Cir.1992). Indeed,
this court has recognized that an applicant does not
have the duty to perform a prior art search. Frazier
v. Roessel Cine Photo Tech, Inc., 417 F.3d 1230,
1238 (Fed.Cir.2005).
*1374 Although this court has upheld the
PTO's authority to request such information as
may be reasonably necessary to properly examine
or treat the matter, Star Fruits S.N.C. v. United
States, 393 F.3d 1277, 1282 (Fed.Cir.2005), Rule
105 relates to information that is already in the applicants'
possession; it does not impose an affirmative
duty to perform a prior art search or opine regarding
patentability over the closest reference. See
37 C.F.R.  1.105. In contrast, the ESD requirement
places a new obligation on the inventor. The ESD is
something more than supplying the Office with an
English language translation or turning over information
already in the applicant's possession. It
shifts the burden of proving patentability onto the

applicant.
This shift of the burden of proof (or production,
for that matter) onto the applicant significantly
alters practice before the PTO and represents a
change in existing law or policy. Animal Legal
Def. Fund, 932 F.2d at 927. Satisfaction of the ESD
requirement requires more than adherence to existing
law and amounts to more than the incidental
inconveniences of complying with an enforcement
scheme. See Chamber of Commerce, 174 F.3d at
211-12. As such, Final Rules 75 and 265 are substantive.
III
Because the Final Rules drastically change the
existing law and alter an inventor's rights and obligations
under the Patent Act, they are substantive
and the PTO exceeded its statutory rulemaking authority
under 35 U.S.C.  2(b)(2). For the reasons
stated above, I would affirm.
