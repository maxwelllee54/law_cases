AUTOGENOMICS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
OXFORD GENE TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, Defendant-
Appellee.
No. 2008-1217.
May 18, 2009.
Background: Competitor filed action against nonresident
patent owner seeking declaratory judgment
of invalidity and non-infringement of patent relating
to oligonucleotide microarrays for analysis of
polynucleotides. The United States District Court
for the Central District of California, Mariana R.
Pfaelzer, Senior District Judge, denied jurisdictional
discovery and dismissed action for lack of personal
jurisdiction. Competitor appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) due process clause would not have been satisfied
by assertion of general personal jurisdiction
over owner;
(2) due process clause would not have been satisfied
by assertion of specific personal jurisdiction
over owner; and
(3) district court did not abuse its discretion under
Ninth Circuit law by denying jurisdictional discovery.
Affirmed.
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.

Plaintiff-Appellant Autogenomics, Inc.
(Autogenomics) sued Defendant-Appellee Oxford
Gene Technology Limited (Oxford) in the United
States District Court for the Central District of
California for a declaratory judgment of invalidity
and non-infringement of claims 9 and 10 of U.S.
Patent No. 6,054,270 (the '270 patent). The district
court granted Oxford's motion to dismiss for lack of
personal jurisdiction. Autogenomics, Inc. v. Oxford
Gene Tech., Ltd., No. SACV 07-846-MRP
(C.D.Cal. Jan. 17, 2008). Autogenomics appeals
this ruling, as well as the district court's denial of
jurisdictional discovery. Because the district court
possessed neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction
over Oxford, and because the court did not
abuse its discretion by denying jurisdictional discovery,
we affirm.
BACKGROUND
A. Jurisdictional Facts
Oxford is a British biotechnology company organized
under the laws of England and Wales. Oxford
owns the '270 patent, which relates to oligonucleotide
microarrays for analysis of polynucleotides.
Oxford is not registered to do business in
California, nor does it have any facilities, assets,
employees, or agents there. Autogenomics is a biotechnology
company organized under the laws of
California, with its main office in Carlsbad, California.
Autogenomics uses microarray technology
in its business. Autogenomics alleges in support of
the district court's personal jurisdiction that Oxford
has several contacts with California. The jurisdictional
facts alleged by Autogenomics are supplemented,
where noted, by uncontradicted evidence
presented by Oxford.
1. Licensing Negotiations Between Autogenomics
and Oxford: In early 2006, Oxford contacted
Autogenomics regarding the '270 patent, which Oxford
contends is infringed by Autogenomics's manufacture
and sale of microarray products. In a February
28, 2006 e-mail, Autogenomics *1015 expressed
interest in taking a license, but provided
Oxford with eleven references that it alleged raise
serious issues with regard to novelty and obviousness
of the '270 patent. Oxford responded by email
on March 23, 2006, with arguments that the '
270 patent was valid over the references, and stated
that we are at a point whereby the commercial negotiations
should begin to work to achieve a license
for the Autogenomics product. In July 2007, two
Oxford representatives flew to California to meet
with representatives of Autogenomics. The parties
failed to agree on license terms.

566 F.3d 1012, 91 U.S.P.Q.2d 1006
(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012)
2. Licenses: Oxford entered into non-exclusive
licenses with about ten California companies
with respect to its microarray technology. Although
no license terms are in evidence, Autogenomics alleges
that one license-not of the '270 patent in particular-
to Incyte Pharmaceutics Inc. (Incyte), a
California company, is an exclusive license. Oxford
claims that it has an open licensing policy for its
patented microarray technology, including the technology
covered by the '270 patent, and specifically
admits that it granted a non-exclusive license of the
'270 patent to Affymetrix Inc., a California company.
3. The Agilent Agreement: According to an
Oxford press release and an article from a public-
ally available website, Oxford and Agilent Technologies
(Agilent)-a company with offices in California-
completed a collaborative agreement in 2007.
Autogenomics characterizes this agreement as a
joint venture. There is no evidence that this agreement
involves a license or has any relationship to
the '270 patent. It involves a collaborative agreement
giving [Oxford] access to Agilent's microarray
platform, confirming [Oxford] as an Agilent
Certified Service Provider, and appointing Agilent
as an OEM supplier for [Oxford] designed microarrays.
The deal will purportedly allow the two companies
to jointly develop a Centre of (Microarray)
Excellence. Oxford executives characterize the relationship
as a close collaboration. The purpose
of the deal is to allow Oxford to become the
largest microarray service provider in Europe. An
uncontested Oxford declaration states:
[Oxford] has a supply agreement with Agilent
that allows [Oxford] to purchase arrays from Agilent
for [Oxford]'s use or resale without geographical
restriction. There is no joint venture
between Agilent and [Oxford]. The agreement
between Agilent and [Oxford] is not a distribution
agreement whereby Agilent supplies
products on [Oxford]'s behalf for or into the California
market, or indeed to any other market.
4. Conferences: Oxford attended three scientific
conferences-trade shows in Autogenomics's terminology-
in California in 2003, 2005, and 2007.
The three conferences dealt with nanotechnology,
bio-nanotechnology, and modeling and simulation
of microsystems, respectively. At the 2003
conference, Oxford is listed among dozens of
presenting companies. At the 2005 conference,
Oxford is listed among dozens of companies under
the heading Past Participant Highlights. At the
2007 conference, Oxford was scheduled to deliver a
20-minute presentation on [a] method for the
highly parallel analysis of gene expression of single
cells. In a 2007 company newsletter, Oxford reported
that it would attend a fourth conference in
California where its booth description characterized
Oxford as focusing on [m]icroarray services and
application products and stated that Oxford
adopts a broad licensing policy for its microarray
patents.
5. Sales: In April 2006, Oxford sold 20 microarrays
to a California company for $7,600. According
to Oxford, the sale constituted*1016 about
1% of its revenue that year. There is no evidence of
what relationship, if any, there might be between
the sale and the '270 patent. Autogenomics also alleges,
without evidentiary support, that Oxford
very likely offered, and possibly contracted to perform
services for numerous California companies,
reasoning that Oxford's likely clients are biotechnology
companies largely based in California. Oxford
provided an uncontested declaration that although
some of the companies named by Autogenomics
either have a license agreement with [Oxford] or
may seek a license agreement from [Oxford] in the
future, the companies ... are not customers of
[Oxford], and are not likely to be.
6. Publication: Oxford published an
application note on Nature.com, the globally-
accessible website of Nature, a United Kingdom
scientific publication. The application note describes
an Oxford microarray product. Autogenomics
characterizes the application note as an advertisement
to California companies, noting that the

B. Procedural Background
On July 23, 2007, Autogenomics filed a declaratory
judgment action against Oxford in the United
States District Court for the Central District of
California. Autogenomics asked the court to find
that claims 9 and 10 of the ' 270 patent are invalid
or unenforceable, and that Autogenomics did not
infringe the same claims. On November 27, 2007,
Oxford filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the
district court lacked either general or specific personal
jurisdiction over it.
On January 17, 2008, the district court ruled
that it lacked general jurisdiction because Oxford's
contacts with California were insufficient to be the
equivalent of having a physical presence within the
state. Autogenomics, No. SACV 07-846-MRP at
8-11. The court further ruled that it lacked specific
jurisdiction because the declaratory judgment action
did not arise from or relate to most of the contacts
alleged by Autogenomics, and those contacts
that did relate to the declaratory judgment action
nonetheless did not contribute to jurisdiction under
our holding in Red Wing Shoe Co. v. Hockerson-
Halberstadt, Inc., 148 F.3d 1355 (Fed.Cir.1998).
Autogenomics, No. SACV 07-846-MRP at 11-16.
Finally, the court denied Autogenomics the opportunity
to conduct jurisdictional discovery because
Autogenomics failed to make a formal motion and
failed to show that discovery would demonstrate
facts sufficient to constitute a basis for jurisdiction.
Id. at 17 n. 3. Autogenomics appeals the district
court's ruling that it lacked personal jurisdiction
over Oxford, as well as the district court's denial of
jurisdictional discovery.
DISCUSSION
I.
[1][2] Personal jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo. Avocent Huntsville Corp. v.
Aten Int'l Co., 552 F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2008)
(citing Genetic Implant Sys., Inc. v. Core-Vent
Corp., 123 F.3d 1455, 1457 (Fed.Cir.1997)).
Moreover, we apply Federal Circuit law because
the jurisdictional issue is intimately involved with
the substance of the patent laws.  Id. (quoting Akro
Corp. v. Luker, 45 F.3d 1541, 1543
(Fed.Cir.1995)); see also Beverly Hills Fan Co. v.
Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558, 1565
(Fed.Cir.1994) (Under [jurisdictional] circumstances
such as these, we have held we owe no special
deference to regional circuit law.).
*1017 In this case, because the parties have
not conducted discovery, [Autogenomics] needed
only to make a prima facie showing that [Oxford]
was subject to personal jurisdiction. As such, the
pleadings and affidavits are to be construed in the
light most favorable to [Autogenomics].  Avocent,
552 F.3d 1324, 1328 (quoting Silent Drive, Inc. v.
Strong Indus., Inc., 326 F.3d 1194, 1201
(Fed.Cir.2003)); see also Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. v.
Coyle, 340 F.3d 1344, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2003)
([W]here the district court's disposition as to the
personal jurisdictional question is based on affidavits
and other written materials in the absence of
an evidentiary hearing, a plaintiff need only to
make a prima facie showing that defendants are
subject to personal jurisdiction. In the procedural
posture of a motion to dismiss, a district court must
accept the uncontroverted allegations in the
plaintiff's complaint as true and resolve any factual
conflicts in the affidavits in the plaintiff's favor.
(citation omitted) (second emphasis added)).
[3][4] Determining whether jurisdiction exists
over an out-of-state defendant involves two inquiries:
whether a forum state's long-arm statute permits
service of process and whether assertion of
personal jurisdiction violates due process. Genetic
Implant, 123 F.3d at 1458 (citing Burger King
Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-76, 105
S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985)). However, because
California's long-arm statute is coextensive
with the limits of due process, the two inquiries collapse
into a single inquiry: whether jurisdiction
comports with due process. Inamed Corp. v. Kuzmak,
249 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

F.3d 1266, 1270 (Fed.Cir.1998)); see also
Cal.Civ.Proc.Code  410.10 (Deering 2001).
[5][6] Autogenomics argues that the district
court has personal jurisdiction over Oxford on two
bases: general and specific personal jurisdiction.
General jurisdiction, on one hand, requires that the
defendant have continuous and systematic contacts
with the forum state and confers personal jurisdiction
even when the cause of action has no relationship
with those contacts. Silent Drive, 326
F.3d at 1200 (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de
Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 416, 104
S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984)). Specific jurisdiction,
on the other hand, must be based on activities
that arise out of or relate to the cause of action,
and can exist even if the defendant's contacts are
not continuous and systematic. Id. (citing Burger
King, 471 U.S. at 472-73, 105 S.Ct. 2174). We will
address general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction
in turn.
A.
[7] The district court correctly ruled that it
lacked general personal jurisdiction over Oxford.
Oxford does not have contacts with the forum state
that qualify as continuous and systematic general
business contacts. Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 416,
104 S.Ct. 1868. Rather, this is a classic case of
sporadic and insubstantial contacts with the forum
state, which are not sufficient to establish general
jurisdiction over the defendants in the forum.
Campbell Pet Co. v. Miale, 542 F.3d 879, 884
(Fed.Cir.2008). In Helicopteros, the Supreme Court
rejected the plaintiff's assertion of personal jurisdiction
in Texas where the defendant did not have a
place of business in Texas and had never been licensed
to do business in the state. 466 U.S. at 416,
104 S.Ct. 1868. The Supreme Court reached this
conclusion despite the fact that the defendant
sen[t] its chief executive officer to Houston for a
contract-negotiation session; accept[ed] into its
New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston
bank; purchas[ed] helicopters, *1018 equip
ment, and training services from Bell Helicopter for
substantial sums; and sen[t] personnel to Bell's facilities
in Fort Worth for training. Id. Like the defendant
in Helicopteros, Oxford has no actual physical
presence or license to do business in California,
and nothing here exceeds the commercial contacts
that the Supreme Court held were insufficient in
Helicopteros.
While acknowledging that the standard for general
jurisdiction is fairly high, Autogenomics argues
that Oxford's attendance at several conferences
in California approximated a physical presence
within the state. Autogenomics urges us to infer
that Oxford was using its conference appearances
to meet with existing and potential customers,
just as it would if it had an office. We decline
to do so. Although we must resolve factual conflicts
in Autogenomics's favor, it is entitled to only those
inferences that are reasonable. Pennington Seed,
Inc. v. Produce Exch. No. 299, 457 F.3d 1334, 1338
(Fed.Cir.2006). Although it is reasonable to infer
that Oxford meets potential customers at conferences,
it is not reasonable to infer that this means
that Oxford's conference booths are mobile offices,
and ultimately, four conferences over five
years constitute only sporadic and insubstantial
contacts. See Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d at 881-82
(holding no general jurisdiction despite defendant's
attendance at a conference where she demonstrated
her products, offered them for sale, took orders,
threatened competitors and harassed her competitor's
customers).
Autogenomics also points to the Agilent agreement
as evidence of continuous and systematic contacts.
We cannot reasonably infer from the Agilent
agreement that the agreement will cause Oxford to
have significantly more contact with California
than the defendant in Helicopteros had with Texas-
repeated purchases and visits by personnel over a
number of years. See 466 U.S. at 418, 104 S.Ct.
1868 (holding that purchases, even if occurring at
regular intervals and visits by personnel in connection
with the purchases were insufficient to es

tablish general personal jurisdiction). All of the
contacts alleged by Autogenomics, even in combination,
are insufficient evidence of continuous and
systematic contacts. See Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d at
883-84 (holding that conference attendance in the
forum, a cease-and-desist letter sent into the forum,
twelve sales in the forum totaling about $14,000 in
revenue, and a generally accessible website were
insufficient to give rise to general jurisdiction). We
similarly considered the litany of inferences that
Autogenomics insists we should draw from the jurisdictional
facts, and likewise conclude that they
are either unreasonable or even if reasonable, ultimately
insufficient. Thus, we conclude that the district
court lacked general personal jurisdiction over
Oxford.
B.
[8][9] Where a defendant is not subject to general
personal jurisdiction in the forum state, a district
court may nonetheless exercise specific personal
jurisdiction over the defendant subject to a
three part test:
(1) the defendant purposefully directed its activities
at residents of the forum, (2) the claim arises
out of or relates to those activities, and (3) assertion
of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and
fair. With respect to the last prong, the burden of
proof is on the defendant, which must present a
compelling case that the presence of some other
considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable
under the five-factor test articulated by
the Supreme Court in Burger King.
Breckenridge Pharm., Inc. v. Metabolite Labs.,
Inc., 444 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2006) (quoting
*1019Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct.
2174). The first two factors correspond with the
minimum contacts' prong of the International Shoe
analysis, and the third factor corresponds with the
fair play and substantial justice prong of the analysis.
Inamed, 249 F.3d at 1360 (citing Akro, 45
F.3d at 1545); see also Int'l Shoe Co. v. Wash., 326
U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).
[10] The district court's decision that it lacked
specific personal jurisdiction was largely based on
Red Wing Shoe, which held that cease-and-desist
letters alone do not suffice to justify personal jurisdiction
in a declaratory judgment action. 148 F.3d
at 1361. The district court concluded that the e-mail
and in-person negotiations between Oxford and
Autogenomics were clearly analogous to the
cease-and-desist communications at issue in the
bevy of cases on this subject. Autogenomics, No.
SACV 07-846-MRP at 12-13. With regard to the
other jurisdictional facts asserted by Autogenomics,
the court acknowledged that we have held that in
combination with cease-and-desist communications,
other activities can give rise to specific personal
jurisdiction. See e.g., Campbell Pet, 542 F.3d
at 885-87 (holding that attempts at extra-judicial
patent enforcement by harming plaintiff's business
activities in forum state is a sufficient additional
factor to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction);
Breckenridge, 444 F.3d at 1366-67 (holding
that entry into an exclusive license with an entity in
the forum state is sufficient extra activity to establish
jurisdiction); Genetic Implant, 123 F.3d at
1458 (holding that the forum had jurisdiction over
the patentee that contracted with [an exclusive distributor]
to sell [the] patented products in [the forum
State] where the agreement was analogous to
a grant of a patent license); Viam Corp. v. Iowa
Exp.-Imp. Trading Co., 84 F.3d 424, 430
(Fed.Cir.1996) (holding that personal jurisdiction
exists where according to their own submission to
this court, [the defendants] have initiated a suit
seeking to enforce the same patent that is the subject
of this suit against other parties, unrelated to
this action, in the same district court); Akro, 45
F.3d at 1548-49 (holding that exclusive licensing of
the accused infringer's competitor in the forum state
constituted the required additional activity beyond
sending warning letters). Here, the district
court concluded that the other contacts asserted by
Autogenomics did not arise from or relate to the declaratory
judgment cause of action. Because it
viewed these other activities as irrelevant to the
question of specific personal jurisdiction, the court

concluded that it did not have personal jurisdiction
over Oxford.
[11] The district court's decision and the principal
briefing on appeal occurred before our decision
in Avocent. In that case, we endeavored to
reconcile our decisions regarding personal jurisdiction
in declaratory judgment actions, and concluded
the following:
While exclusive licensing agreements and other
undertakings that impose enforcement obligations
on a patentee or its licensee reflect the kind of
other activities that support specific personal
jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action, the
defendant patentee's own commercialization
activity does not. What the patentee makes, uses,
offers to sell, sells, or imports is of no real relevance
to the enforcement or defense of a patent,
because the federal patent laws do not create any
affirmative right to make, use, or sell anything.
Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1335 (quoting Leather-
man Tool Group Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 131
F.3d 1011, 1015 (Fed.Cir.1997)). Avocent explained
that the contacts material to the specific jurisdiction
analysis in a *1020 declaratory judgment
action are not just any activities related to the pat-
ent-at-issue. Rather, the relevant activities are those
that the defendant purposefully directs ... at the
forum which relate in some material way to the enforcement
or the defense of the patent. Id. at 1336.
Thus, courts must examine the jurisdictional facts
for conduct whereby the patentee may be said to
purposefully avail itself of the forum and to engage
in activity that relates to the validity and enforceability
of the patent. Id. In Red Wing Shoe, we observed
that the logic of this rule does not flow from
the fact that the action is for declaratory judgment
because indeed, cease-and-desist letters are the very
reason for such an action:
In the event a patentee casts its net of ceaseand-
desist letters too widely and entangles some
non-infringing products, a plaintiff may have
little recourse other than a declaratory judgment
action to disentangle its non-infringing business.
In those instances, the cease-and-desist letters are
the cause of the entanglement and at least partially
give rise to the plaintiff's action. In sum,
the mirror-image analysis does not account for
the legitimate use of a declaratory judgment action
as a disentanglement tool. Thus, it ignores
the essential fact that in a declaratory judgment
action, the patentee is, after all, the defendant.
148 F.3d at 1360. Rather, we explained that:
Principles of fair play and substantial justice af
ford a patentee sufficient latitude to inform others
of its patent rights without subjecting itself to jur
isdiction in a foreign forum. A patentee should
not subject itself to personal jurisdiction in a for
um solely by informing a party who happens to
be located there of suspected infringement.
Grounding personal jurisdiction on such contacts
alone would not comport with principles of fair
ness.
Id. at 1360-61.
[12] Our holding in Avocent was that only enforcement
or defense efforts related to the patent
rather than the patentee's own commercialization
efforts are to be considered for establishing specific
personal jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action
against the patentee. 552 F.3d at 1336. The dissent
suggests that this reading of Avocent renders it
in conflict with other precedent of this court. The
court in Avocent, however, considered and distinguished
the very precedent that the dissent cites.
552 F.3d at 1334-35, 1338-39 (discussing Viam,
Campbell Pet, and Red Wing Shoe ). In Viam, for
example, where this court held personal jurisdiction
existed, the patentee had sued another infringer in
the same court on the same patent-enforcement efforts
in the forum. 84 F.3d at 430. In Campbell Pet,
where the court held personal jurisdiction existed,
the patentee had enlisted a third party to remove the
defendant's products from a trade show that was being
held in the forum state-enforcement efforts in
the forum. 542 F.3d at 886. In Red Wing Shoe, despite

State, no personal jurisdiction existed because of an
absence of enforcement efforts. 148 F.3d at 1359,

1362.
FN1. The dissent also suggests that this decision
is inconsistent with our court's recent
decision in Synthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M.
Dos Reis Jr. Ind. Com. de Equip. Medico,
563 F.3d 1285 (Fed.Cir.2009). Synthes was
not a declaratory judgment action against
the patent holder but rather an infringement
suit brought by the patentee against
an accused infringer, where commercialization-
type contacts are highly relevant to
personal jurisdiction. By contrast, in Avocent
we held that [w]hat the patentee
makes, uses, offers to sell, sells, or imports
is of no real relevance to the enforcement
or defense of a patent. 552 F.3d at 1335.
The dissent may be correct that Red Wing
Shoe rested not on this reasoning, but
rather on principles of fairness. See 148
F.3d at 1360-61. Regardless of whether
Avocent went further than Red Wing Shoe
required, it is now clear and binding precedent.
*1021 Although we too are concerned that foreign
patentees like Oxford may engage in significant
commercialization and licensing efforts in a
state while benefiting from the shelter of the Avocent
rule, we are nonetheless bound by Avocent. We
note, however, that it is not the case that the 50% of
all patentees who are foreign are always immunized
from adjudication as the dissent suggests. Jurisdiction
over foreign patentees like Oxford continues
to be available in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia. See 35 U.S.C.
293.
Because principal briefing had been completed
in this case prior to our decision in Avocent, on
December 19, 2008, we asked the parties to submit
supplemental briefing addressing Avocent. Autogenomics
had originally argued that Oxford had nine
types of contacts with California. In its supplement
al brief, Autogenomics concedes that our holding
in Avocent eliminated seven of those nine types of
contacts in the context of a declaratory judgment
action. Appellant's Supplemental Br. 2. Autogenomics
explained that only two of the alleged types
of contacts Oxford had with California were still
relevant to the specific jurisdiction inquiry: the
Agilent agreement and the licenses. Id. at 2-3.
First, Autogenomics asserts that the Agilent
agreement is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over
Oxford. We disagree. Although Agilent is a California
company, and the agreement was created to
pursue the field of microarrays, there is nothing in
evidence, nor would it be a reasonable inference, to
suggest that this agreement involves the '270 patent
or is analogous to a grant of a patent license. Genetic
Implant, 123 F.3d at 1458.
Second, Autogenomics argues that we should
infer that Oxford gave an exclusive license that
relates to the '270 patent. As support for this contention,
Autogenomics argues that the allegedly exclusive
Incyte license means that the following declaration
of Oxford's director of licensing and business
development is false: [Oxford] has an open licensing
policy for its patented microarray technology,
including the technology covered by the '270
patents. All of [Oxford's] licenses are nonexclusive....
Even though the Incyte license does not relate
to the patent-at-issue in our case, Autogenomics
argues that because of this apparent inconsistency,
we should infer that Oxford is hiding an exclusive
license of the '270 patent. We disagree because
although the inconsistency greatly weakens
the strength of Oxford's declaration, it is nonetheless
undisputed that there are numerous nonexclusive
licenses of the '270 patent. Because of
this, it cannot be a reasonable inference that there is
also an exclusive license of the same patent. We
therefore conclude that the district court does not
have specific personal jurisdiction over Oxford because
Autogenomics has failed to allege sufficient
activities relat[ing] to the validity and enforceability
of the patent in addition to the cease-and-desist

II.
[13][14][15] Autogenomics also appeals the
district court's denial of jurisdictional discovery.
We review the district court's denial of discovery,
an issue not unique to patent law, for abuse of discretion,
applying the law of the regional circuit.
*1022Digeo, Inc. v. Audible, Inc., 505 F.3d 1362,
1370 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing Qualls v. Blue Cross,
Inc., 22 F.3d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1994)); see also
Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy, 453 F.3d 1151, 1154
(9th Cir.2006) (We review a district court's decision
to grant or deny discovery on jurisdictional
facts for abuse of discretion.). A reviewing court
will not disturb a denial of additional discovery unless
there is the clearest showing that the denial
will result in actual and substantial prejudice to the
complaining litigant (e.g., a reasonable probability
that the outcome would have been different had
discovery been allowed). Digeo, 505 F.3d at 1370
(quoting Laub v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 342 F.3d
1080, 1093 (9th Cir.2003)).
In this case, there is no denial of a motion for
jurisdictional discovery for us to review because
there was no formal motion for jurisdictional discovery.
According to an uncontroverted declaration
by counsel for Oxford, on November 26, 2007,
counsel for Oxford contacted counsel for Autogenomics
to warn him of the pending motion to dismiss
for lack of personal jurisdiction. After discussing
arguments relating to jurisdiction, counsel for
Autogenomics raised the possibility of jurisdictional
discovery, and asked for the contact information
of relevant people at Oxford. Counsel for Oxford
identified two people and indicated that he was
willing to discuss the issue further, even after Oxford
filed its motion to dismiss. Counsel for Autogenomics
said that he would call back within a few
days, but he did not. Oxford filed its motion to dismiss
on November 27, 2007.
In its opposition to Oxford's motion to dismiss,
filed December 21, 2007, Autogenomics stated,
without elaboration, that [i]n the event that the
Court is not completely convinced of jurisdiction,
Autogenomics hereby requests that the Court grant
limited discovery. On December 28, 2007, the district
court attempted to contact counsel for Autogenomics
to advise him of how to properly request
jurisdictional discovery. On January 2, 2008, counsel
for Autogenomics returned the court's telephone
call, leaving a message for the clerk. At the hearing
for the motion to dismiss on January 14, 2008,
Autogenomics reiterated its request for jurisdictional
discovery. The district court noted that it never
received the required formal motion. In its January
17, 2008 ruling, the court refused to grant jurisdictional
discovery. The court found that the suggestions
at oral argument and in the opposition brief
were insufficient, and regardless, that Autogenomics
had not shown, with any degree of specificity,
that discovery would demonstrate facts sufficient
to constitute a basis for jurisdiction.  Autogenomics,
No. SACV 07-846-MRP at 17 n. 3 (quoting
Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co.,
556 F.2d 406, 430 n. 24 (9th Cir.1977)).
[16] The district court did not abuse its discretion
by denying jurisdictional discovery. As an initial
matter, the district court is correct that under
Ninth Circuit law, it is not necessarily an abuse of
discretion to reject a request for jurisdictional discovery
because no formal motion was made. Sopcak
v. N. Mountain Helicopter Serv., 52 F.3d 817,
819 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that district court did
not abuse its discretion by denying discovery where
rather than moving for extension of time to oppose
the dismissal motion, the Appellants filed an opposition
which stated in part: [h]owever, if the court
believes that there is not sufficient evidence to support
plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegation, plaintiffs
respectfully request an opportunity to conduct discovery
). Autogenomics attempts to distinguish
Sopcak by arguing that it did not become aware that
jurisdictional discovery would be necessary until
days before filing its opposition. It is *1023 undisputed,
however, that Autogenomics considered
and discussed jurisdictional discovery issues with
opposing counsel before Oxford filed its motion to
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

dismiss. Moreover, by proactively contacting counsel
for Autogenomics, the judge expressed a willingness
to consider a formal motion even after
Autogenomics made its unsupported request in its
opposition brief. And of course, Autogenomics
could have moved for an extension of time as the
Ninth Circuit suggested in Sopcak. Autogenomics
can not now complain that the court erred by not
allowing them to conduct eleventh-hour discovery
FN2
upon an adverse ruling. Id.
FN2. Autogenomics relies on Commissariat
A L'Energie Atomique v. Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp., 395 F.3d 1315, 1323
(Fed.Cir.2005), which applied Third Circuit
law to hold that plaintiffs did not
waive their right to discovery, but preserved
the issue by, [a] initially requesting
discovery in their opposition to the motion
to dismiss, [b] a request that was reiterated
during oral argument, and [c] reasserted ...
in greater detail in their motion for reconsideration.
This rule, regardless of its
merits, cannot overrule the Ninth Circuit's
law here. Even if this rule were applicable,
Autogenomics failed at any point, much
less in a motion for reconsideration, to
provide the district court greater detail,
much less any detailed reasons at all for
seeking discovery.
Furthermore, although we held in Commissariat
that [i]n determining the relevance
of a request for jurisdictional discovery,
we apply Federal Circuit law,
that is not our task here. 395 F.3d at
1323. Rather, we are making a threshold
decision of whether the denial of discovery
was an abuse of discretion where the
plaintiff failed to make a formal motion
and failed to articulate any reasons for
why discovery was necessary. See id. at
1322 (On procedural issues such as the
timeliness of discovery requests, we are
guided by the law of the regional circuit
in which the district court sits.). This is
a question controlled by Ninth Circuit
law. Indeed, we cannot evaluate the
relevance of Autogenomics's request
because it provided the district court
with no reasons for its request or particular
areas to which discovery would be
directed. In Commissariat, by contrast,
the plaintiff clearly made a sufficient
threshold showing to merit jurisdictional
discovery. Id. at 1323. Autogenomics
made no such showing.
Furthermore, as the district court noted, [a]n
appellate court will not interfere with the trial
court's refusal to grant discovery except upon the
clearest showing that the dismissal resulted in actual
and substantial prejudice to the litigant; such a
refusal is not an abuse of discretion when it is clear
that further discovery would not demonstrate facts
sufficient to constitute a basis for jurisdiction.
Wells Fargo, 556 F.2d at 430 n. 24; see also Laub,
342 F.3d at 1093 (Prejudice is established if there
is a reasonable probability that the outcome would
have been different had discovery been allowed.).
Autogenomics did not make, either in its opposition
brief or at the motion hearing, a showing that further
discovery would elucidate the facts necessary
to prove that the court had personal jurisdiction.
Such a showing is especially important where, as
here, the defendant enters declarations into evidence
specifically denying certain jurisdictional allegations.
Terracom v. Valley Nat'l Bank, 49 F.3d
555, 562 (9th Cir.1995) ([W]here a plaintiff's
claim of personal jurisdiction appears to be both attenuated
and based on bare allegations in the face
of specific denials made by defendants, the Court
need not permit even limited discovery....). Only
now, on appeal, does Autogenomics explain how
discovery could help establish the court's jurisdiction.
We need not evaluate the merits of these arguments
because they were never made to the district
court, and thus do not have any bearing on our review
of the district court's decision for abuse of discretion.
Nor do we agree with Autogenomics that

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 1012)
the arguments are so obvious that the court
should have reached them as reasonable inferences
in *1024 view of the jurisdictional facts it had before
it. Therefore, we conclude that the district
court acted within its discretion by denying Autogenomics's
request for jurisdictional discovery.
CONCLUSION
The district court possessed neither general nor
specific personal jurisdiction over Oxford, and the
court did not abuse its discretion by denying Autogenomics's
request for jurisdictional discovery. The
judgment below is
AFFIRMED.
NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
The Federal Circuit again restricts United
States parties from access to our courts when a
United States patent is owned by a foreign entity.
The court rules that the foreign patent owner is not
subject to suit in California despite its commercial
presence in California including the grant of at least
ten patent licenses to companies in California; despite
a manufacturing venture of the patent owner
with a California-based company to produce and
sell microarrays designed by the patent owner; despite
participation by the patent owner with respect
to the patented technology in trade shows and scientific
meetings in California; and despite the patent
owner's threats of infringement against Autogenomics,
a California company whose accused activities
are conducted in California. On the entirety of
these contacts, jurisdiction of this declaratory judgment
action was proper in the Central District of
California. From my colleagues' contrary ruling, I
respectfully dissent.
DISCUSSION
It is not disputed that there is a case of actual
controversy in accordance with the Declaratory
Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.  2201(a), between the
patent owner Oxford Gene Technology Inc., a British
company, and the plaintiff Autogenomics. The
only question is whether the requirements of personal
jurisdiction have been met in California, the
resident forum of Autogenomics, recognizing that
Oxford is not registered to do business in any of the
United States.
Where a foreign defendant has not consented to
suit in a forum, the inquiry into personal jurisdiction
turns on a trio of criteria, generally designated
as purposeful availment, relatedness, and reasonableness.
Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471
U.S. 462, 472-77, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528
(1985); Akro Corp. v. Luker, 45 F.3d 1541, 1545
(Fed.Cir.1995). First, the defendant must have purposefully
availed itself of the forum by conducting
activities in the forum. Second, the plaintiff's claim
must arise from or be related to the defendant's
activities in the forum. And third, the court's exercise
of personal jurisdiction must comport with the
principles of due process and fairness.
Autogenomics readily made a prima facie
showing as to these criteria, for Oxford owns several
United States patents, including the patent that is
the subject of this declaratory action, and is exercising
its United States patent rights through approximately
ten licensees in California. Autogenomics
states that Oxford has entered into a manufacturing
venture with the California company Agilent,
whereby Agilent serves as a California-based
supplier of microarrays designed by Oxford. Oxford's
employees have personally exhibited the Oxford
technology at trade shows in California and
publicized the availability of licenses for Oxford's
United States patents. The record shows sale of Oxford
microarray products to at least one customer in
California. Oxford employees *1025 traveled to
California and negotiated with Autogenomics in
that forum. In addition, California is the primary
site of Autogenomics' business, the forum in which
the accused infringing activities are conducted, and
in which Oxford's threatened enforcement of its
patent would occur. Many of Oxford's contacts with
California relate directly to the ' 270 patent, the
subject of this lawsuit.
The reasonableness inquiry applies to both defendant
and plaintiff, invoking notions of fair play

and substantial justice, Akro, 45 F.3d at 1546, as
measured by factors such as those discussed in Burger
King:
[C]ourts in appropriate cases may evaluate the
burden on the defendant, the forum State's interest
in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's
interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,
the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining
the most efficient resolution of controversies,
and the shared interest of the several States
in furthering fundamental substantive social
policies.
471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444
U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490
(1980)) (quotation marks omitted). Considerations
of reasonableness give effect to the equitable authority
of courts to provide access to adjudication
when such is warranted, while protecting both sides
from unfair burdens. Considerations of fairness and
justice are central to the due process analysis, the
Court observing that [t]hese considerations sometimes
serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction
upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts
than would otherwise be required. Burger King,
471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (citing Keeton v.
Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 780, 104

Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223-24, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2
L.Ed.2d 223 (1957)).
Autogenomics brought this declaratory judgment
action in the forum of its corporate residence
and principal place of business, the location of the
activities that Oxford says infringe its United States
patents. The compulsory counterclaim of infringement
would center on activities in the Central District
of California. No other forum has been asserted
by Oxford to be more convenient; indeed, the
entire relationship between Oxford and Autogenomics
has been in the California forum, which is a
primary locus of the biotechnology industry in
which both parties are engaged. All of these factors
are relevant to the inquiry of whether the quality
and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and
orderly administration of the laws is sufficient for
a forum to exercise jurisdiction. International Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct.
154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).
Personal jurisdiction of owners of United
States patents has been recognized in circumstances
no closer to the forum than those here. In Campbell
Pet Co. v. Miale, 542 F.3d 879 (Fed.Cir.2008), this
court held that the patentee, a corporation having a
California residence, was nonetheless subject to
personal jurisdiction in the state of Washington,
upon having attended a trade show in Washington
and complained about the plaintiff's display, then
writing to the plaintiff in Washington, charging infringement.
Id. at 886. In Viam Corp. v. Iowa Export-
Import Trading Co., 84 F.3d 424
(Fed.Cir.1996), this court held that the Central District
of California had personal jurisdiction of the
Italian corporation SPAL, which owned a United
States patent. SPAL had no United States residence,
although it had an exclusive distributor resident in
Iowa, and its only activity *1026 involving California
was the importation and sale of the patented
goods in California by its distributor; but this court
held: There is sufficient connection between [the
non-resident patent owner's and its distributor's]
activity and the litigation to satisfy [the minimum
contacts] prong of the International Shoe Due Process
test. Id. at 429. This court determined that the
foreign patentee ha[d] purposefully availed himself
of the privilege of conducting activities within
the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections
of its laws.  Id. at 428 (quoting Hanson v.
Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2
L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)). The court also observed that
allowing the forum to exercise jurisdiction cannot
be said to be unfair. Id. at 430.
The comparison with Viam is informative, for
both Oxford and SPAL are foreign owners of
United States patents who do business in the forum

without themselves residing in the forum. In Oxford's
case its patented inventions are placed in
United States commerce through manufacture by
United States licensees, providing a more direct
connection with United States commerce than the
importation of products manufactured offshore. Oxford's
contacts with the California forum are not
random, fortuitous, or attenuated, Burger King,
471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (internal quotation
marks omitted), but are the normal course of Oxford's
business of exploiting and profiting from its
United States patents.
Today's ruling is also incompatible with this
court's recent decision in Synthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M.
Dos Reis Jr. Ind. Com. de Equip. Medico, 563 F.3d
1285 (Fed.Cir.2009). Synthes involved a patent infringement
suit filed by a United States plaintiff
against a Brazilian entity whose products were
offered for sale at trade shows in the United States,
although no actual sales of the allegedly infringing
products were made in the United States. The
Brazilian company had no office or subsidiary or licensee
in the United States, although it purchased
United States products for use or resale in Brazil.
This court applied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
FN1
4(k)(2), the federal long-arm statute, and
held that the entire United States is an available forum.
563 F.3d at 1290. The court considered the entirety
of the contacts, and found them sufficient to
establish specific personal jurisdiction over the
Brazilian defendant. Id. at 1292. The court stressed
that the Brazilian company's attendance at trade
shows in the United States included display of an
allegedly infringing product. Id. at 1292. My colleagues
assert that Synthes is not relevant merely
because the foreign party was the accused infringer,
rather than the patentee. See maj. op. at 1020-21 n.
1. But this court has previously recognized that this
is not a valid means of distinguishing cases, for
Viam relied on the stream of commerce to establish
personal jurisdiction, see Beverly Hills Fan Co. v.
Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558, 1566
(Fed.Cir.1994), although the foreign defendant in
Beverly Hills Fan was the accused infringer rather
than the patentee. See Viam, 84 F.3d at 428 (All
the reasons for adopting and applying the stream of
commerce theory to the question of personal jurisdiction
*1027 over an out-of-state alleged infringer
as defendant, fully explored in Beverly Hills Fan,
are equally applicable to the same question regarding
an out-of-state patentee as defendant.).
FN1. Rule 4(k)(2) states:
(2) Federal Claim Outside State-Court
Jurisdiction
For a claim that arises under federal law,
serving a summons or filing a waiver of
service establishes personal jurisdiction
over a defendant if:
(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction
in any state's courts of general
jurisdiction; and
(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent
with the United States Constitution and
laws.
On considering the interests of both sides to
this dispute, in light of precedent, it has not been
shown that subjecting Oxford to suit in California is
either unreasonable or unfair. My colleagues on this
panel hold that the California forum has neither
general nor specific jurisdiction over Oxford, although
the Central District of California is the forum
most directly related to Oxford's activities in
the United States, as well as being the locus of the
accused infringement. Nonetheless, this court immunizes
Oxford, the owner of a United States patent,
from resolution of the patent dispute. This
court has recognized that [j]ust as a state has a
substantial interest in preventing patent infringement
within its borders, it also has a substantial interest
in protecting its residents from claims of patent
infringement that may be unwarranted. Deprenyl

Depriving Autogenomics of the opportunity to
resolve the threat of infringement is contrary to the
purpose and principles of the Declaratory Judgment
Act. See MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549
U.S. 118, 128-32, 127 S.Ct. 764, 166 L.Ed.2d 604
(2007) (explaining that public policy favors declaratory
challenge to adverse patents by persons
whose substantial rights may be affected).
My colleagues on this panel, in support of their
ruling that Oxford cannot be sued in California, cite
this court's recent holding in Avocent Huntsville
Corp. v. Aten International Co., 552 F.3d 1324,
1335 (Fed.Cir.2008). However, if Avocent is read to
bar this suit, it is in conflict with precedent of this
court and the Supreme Court, as discussed therein.
See id. at 1341-51 (Newman, J., dissenting). Viam
held that the foreign patent owner's sales (through a
distributor) in the forum sufficed to support personal
jurisdiction, while Avocent ruled that such sales
are irrelevant to personal jurisdiction. This direct
conflict simply adds confusion; however, this court
remains bound by the rule of interpanel accord,
which is that in the event of conflict, real or perceived,
the earlier decision controls until the conflict
is resolved. See, e.g., Newell Cos. v. Kenney
Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed.Cir.1988).
The panel majority also cites the statement in
Red Wing Shoe Inc. v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc.,
148 F.3d 1355 (Fed.Cir.1998), that [p]rinciples of
fair play and substantial justice afford a patentee
sufficient latitude to inform others of its patent
rights without subjecting itself to jurisdiction in the
foreign forum, id. at 1360-61, principles with
which I fully agree. However, while the Red Wing
court made this statement to explain why personal
jurisdiction does not arise from infringement letters,
the court seems to have confused personal jurisdiction
with the showing of a case or controversy
that is needed to establish subject matter jurisdiction
for a declaratory judgment action. Whether
accusations of infringement are actionable in a
specific case has no relation to where suit may be
brought when a case or controversy does indeed ex
ist, as in this case.
The evolving law under MedImmune facilitates
challenge to adversely held patents. See, e.g.,
SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480
F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2007) (The Supreme
Court's opinion in MedImmune represents a rejection
of our reasonable apprehension of suit test.).
The court's ruling today negates this development,
by unduly narrowing personal jurisdiction to bar an
action that *1028 the Court has advised should be
available under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Although
undoubtedly there are circumstances in
which a foreign patent owner can properly avoid
jurisdiction, here the foreign patentee is actively
and forcefully using its United States patents in a
competitive context within the forum of this suit.
Equity favors the reasonableness of permitting
Autogenomics to resolve the threat, instead of continuing
to face the uncertainty of liability and business
risk, at the whim of the patent owner.
This is not a trivial question. The PTO reports
that 50.3% of the patents granted in 2008 were issued
to foreign patentees. See USPTO, Extended
Year Set-Historic Patents By Country, State, and
Year-All Patent Types (December 2008), available
at http:// www. uspto. gov/ web/ offices/ ac/ ido/
oeip/ taf/ cst_ allh. htm. Thus restriction on the
availability of declaratory judgment actions against
foreign-owned patents is of economic significance.
As this court stated in Viam, it cannot have been
contemplated that activities otherwise subject to
federal jurisdiction, are always immunized from adjudication
when the patent owner's address is offshore.
84 F.3d at 429-30. The panel majority asserts
that, at a minimum, the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia remains a fall-back forum,
see 35 U.S.C.  293. It is surely useful that the
District of Columbia court can have jurisdiction to
take any action respecting the patent or rights thereunder.
Id. That is not the issue herein, nor does
293 override personal jurisdiction in a more suitable
and convenient forum. See Deprenyl Animal
Health, 297 F.3d at 1353 (section 293 represents

an important Congressional judgment that in exchange
for obtaining the benefits of a United States
patent, it is appropriate to require foreign patentees
to submit to broader jurisdiction in United States
Federal Court than that to which they would otherwise
be subject.). It is not explained why a California
plaintiff should have to resort to a distant
forum, which is not alleged to have meaningful
contacts with either party, to resolve a dispute that
centers upon actions by both the plaintiff and the
foreign patentee in the state of California. I take
note that Oxford has not suggested transfer to the
District of Columbia; the Oxford position is that it
cannot be sued.
The court's decision that Oxford cannot be
brought before the court in the Central District of
California is contrary to law, precedent, and policy.
I respectfully dissent.
