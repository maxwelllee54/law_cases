v.
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 2008-1248.
April 3, 2009.
Background: Owners of patent claiming methods
comprising the single step of reducing Nuclear
Factor Kappa B (NF-KB) activity in eukaryotic
cells brought infringement action against competitor.
After a jury found infringement, and concluded
that the asserted claims were not invalid for anticipation,
lack of enablement, or lack of written description,
the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts, Rya W. Zobel, J., 529
F.Supp.2d 106, denied competitor's motion for
judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and a final
judgment was entered, 2007 WL 2712087. Competitor
appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) patent owners failed to provide adequate written
description of the claims;
(2) fact that figure containing errors was left in application
was insufficient to satisfy intent element
of inequitable conduct claim; and
(3) district court did not clearly err by finding no
intent to deceive the Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO) on part of co-inventor.
Affirmed in part and reversed in part.
Linn, Circuit Judge, filed a concurring opinion.

gris. The jury also concluded that the asserted
claims were not invalid for anticipation, lack of enablement,
or lack of written description.
Both at the close of Ariad's case-in-chief and
again after the jury verdict, Lilly moved for judgment
as a matter of law (JMOL) that the asserted
claims were not infringed and were invalid for anticipation,
lack of enablement, or lack of written description.
Following a separate bench trial, the district
court ruled that the asserted claims were directed
to patentable subject matter and that the '516
patent was not unenforceable due to inequitable
conduct or prosecution laches. Ariad Pharms., Inc.
v. Eli Lilly & Co., 529 F.Supp.2d 106
(D.Mass.2007). Lilly appeals several rulings, including
the court's denial of its JMOL motion and
the court's ruling on inequitable conduct. For the
reasons set forth below, we reverse-in-part and affirm-
in-part.
BACKGROUND
The technology in this case involves gene regulation.
Transcription factors are molecules found in
cells that regulate the extent to which genes are expressed.
There are hundreds of different transcription
factors that perform in concert with other molecules
in the cell to control cellular behavior. Unsurprisingly,
this network of cellular signals is fertile
ground for the development of therapeutic compounds.
In the mid-1980s, the inventors of the ' 516
patent discovered an important transcription factor
that they named NF-KB. NF-KB is akin to an all-
purpose cellular paramedic. When the cell receives
a harmful extracellular influence, such as lipopolysaccha
rides produced by bacteria, NF-KB is activated.
Once activated, NF-KB travels to the nucleus
of the cell and fulfills its role as a transcription
factor, inducing the expression of numerous genes
and causing the cell to produce the corresponding
proteins. These proteins, for example certain cytokines,
help the cell survive the extracellular influence,
but they can be harmful in excess-not unlike
how a fever is thought to combat infection but can
cause harm if left unchecked. Once the offending
extracellular influence diminishes, for example, following
the administration of antibiotics for a bacterial
infection,*1370 NF-KB activity decreases
and the cell returns to its original state.
The inventors of the '516 patent further realized
that if NF-KB activity could be reduced artificially,
it could ameliorate the harmful symptoms of diseases
that trigger NF-KB activation-not unlike how
aspirin can reduce a fever without actually treating
the underlying infection. The asserted claims, rewritten
to include the claims from which they depend,
are as follows:
80. [A method for modifying effects of external
influences on a eukaryotic cell, which external
influences induce NF-KB-mediated intracellular
signaling, the method comprising altering NF-KB
activity in the cells such that NF-KB-mediated
effects of external influences are modified,
wherein NF-KB activity in the cell is reduced]
wherein reducing NF-KB activity comprises reducing
binding of NF-KB to NF-KB recognition
sites on genes which are transcriptionally regulated
by NF-KB.
95. [A method for reducing, in eukaryotic cells,
the level of expression of genes which are activated
by extracellular influences which induce NF-
KB-mediated intracellular signaling, the method
comprising reducing NF-KB activity in the cells
such that expression of said genes is reduced],
carried out on human cells.
144. [A method for reducing bacterial lipopolysaccharide-
induced expression of cytokines in
mammalian cells, which method comprises reducing
NF-KB activity in the cells so as to reduce
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression
of said cytokines in the cells] wherein reducing
NF-KB activity comprises reducing binding of
NF-KB to NF-KB recognition sites on genes
which are transcriptionally regulated by NF-KB.

mammalian cells, which method comprises reducing
NF-KB activity in the cells so as to reduce
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression
of said cytokines in the cells], carried out on human
cells.
Importantly, the district court determined that
reducing NF-KB activity means decreasing the
function of NF-KB to act as an intracellular messenger
that regulates transcription of particular
genes, in response to certain stimuli. Ariad
Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., No. 02-cv-11280,
2004 WL 413262, at *1, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
3170, at *3 (D.Mass. Mar. 3, 2004). Neither party
appealed the district court's claim construction.
Ariad filed its complaint on the day the '516
patent issued, June 25, 2002. During the proceedings,
the district court denied Lilly's combined motion
to dismiss and motion for summary judgment.
Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., No.
02-cv-11280, 2003 WL 21087115, 2003 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 8030 (D.Mass. May 12, 2003). On April 4,
2005, Lilly filed a request for reexamination of the '
516 patent. The district court denied Lilly's motion
for a stay. Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,
No. 02-cv-11280, 2005 WL 1342721, 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 10941 (D. Mass. June 6, 2005). The
district court also denied Lilly's renewed motion to
stay made on January 17, 2006. There was a fourteen-
day jury trial in April, 2006. At the close of
Ariad's case-in-chief, Lilly moved for JMOL that
the asserted claims were not infringed and were invalid
for anticipation, lack of enablement, or lack of
written description. The district court denied the
JMOL motion without opinion.
On April 28, 2006, the jury rendered a special
verdict finding infringement of claims 80 and 95
with respect to Evista and claims 144 and 145 with
respect to Xigris. The jury also found that the asserted
claims were not invalid for anticipation,*1371
lack of enablement, or lack of written description.
The court denied Lilly's renewed motion for JMOL
or, in the alternative, a new trial, again without
opinion. In August 2006, the court conducted a
four-day bench trial on three further defenses
offered by Lilly: unpatentable subject matter, inequitable
conduct, and prosecution laches. The district
court ruled in favor of Ariad on all three issues.
Ariad Pharms., Inc., 529 F.Supp.2d 106.
Lilly timely appeals all of these rulings except
the district court's ruling that prosecution laches did
not render the '516 patent unenforceable. We have
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(1).

In other words, the applicant must convey with
reasonable clarity to those skilled in *1372 the art
that, as of the filing date sought, he or she was in
possession of the invention, and demonstrate that
by disclosure in the specification of the patent. Id.
(quoting Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d
1555, 1563-64 (Fed.Cir.1991)). Such disclosure
need not recite the claimed invention in haec verba,
but it must do more than merely disclose that which
would render the claimed invention obvious.

(Fed.Cir.2008) (explaining that  112,  1 requires
that the written description actually or inherently
disclose the claim element).
[7][8] Whether the written description requirement
is satisfied is a fact-based inquiry that
will depend on the nature of the claimed invention
and the knowledge of one skilled in the art at the
time an invention is made and a patent application
is filed. Carnegie Mellon, 541 F.3d at 1122 (citing
Enzo, 323 F.3d at 963). The written description requirement
is not satisfied by [t]he appearance of
mere indistinct words in a specification or a claim,
even an original claim.... A description of what a
material does, rather than of what it is, usually does
not suffice. Enzo, 323 F.3d at 968 (citing Eli Lilly,
119 F.3d at 1568); see Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926
([G]eneralized language may not suffice if it does
not convey the detailed identity of an invention.).
[9] The same is true for both process claims
and composition claims. Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926
(Regardless whether a compound is claimed per se
or a method is claimed that entails the use of the
compound, the inventor cannot lay claim to that
subject matter unless he can provide a description
of the compound sufficient to distinguish infringing
compounds from non-infringing compounds, or infringing
methods from non-infringing methods.).
Where the specification provides only constructive
examples in lieu of working examples, it must still
describe the claimed subject matter in terms that
establish that the applicant was in possession of the
claimed invention, including all of the elements and
limitations. Id. (citing Hyatt v. Boone, 146 F.3d
1348, 1353 (Fed.Cir.1998)).
[10][11] Of course, what is adequate depends
upon the context of the claimed invention. See Capon,
418 F.3d at 1358 (The written description requirement
must be applied in the context of the particular
invention and state of the knowledge.). We
have articulated a variety of factors to evaluate the
adequacy of the disclosure supporting generic
claims to biological subject matter. Id. at 1359.

These factors include the existing knowledge in
the particular field, the extent and content of the
prior art, the maturity of the science or technology,
[and] the predictability of the aspect at issue. Id.
Ariad explains that developing the subject matter
of the '516 patent required years of hard work,
great skill, and extraordinary creativity-so much so
that the inventors first needed to discover, give
names to, and describe previously unknown cellular
components as a necessary predicate for their inventions.
Lilly offered the undisputed expert testimony
of David Latchman that the field of the invention
was particularly unpredictable. Thus, this
invention was made in a new and unpredictable
field where the existing knowledge and prior art
was scant. See Capon, 418 F.3d at 1359.
A.
[12] Ariad claims methods comprising the
single step of reducing NF-KB activity. Lilly argues
that the asserted claims are not supported by
written description because*1373 the specification
of the '516 patent fails to adequately disclose how
the claimed reduction of NF-KB activity is
achieved. The parties agree that the specification of
the '516 patent hypothesizes three classes of molecules
potentially capable of reducing NF-KB
activity: specific inhibitors, dominantly interfering
molecules, and decoy molecules. Lilly contends
that this disclosure amounts to little more than a research
plan, and does not satisfy the patentee's quid
pro quo as described in Rochester. Ariad responds
that Lilly's arguments fail as a matter of law because
Ariad did not actually claim the molecules.
According to Ariad, because there is no term in the
asserted claims that corresponds to the molecules, it
is entitled to claim the methods without describing
the molecules. Ariad's legal assertion, however, is
flawed.
In Rochester, we held very similar method
claims invalid for lack of written description. Id.
(holding patent invalid because Rochester did not
present any evidence that the ordinarily skilled artisan
would be able to identify any compound based
on [the specification's] vague functional description);
see also Fiers v. Revel, 984 F.2d 1164,
1170-71 (Fed.Cir.1993) (holding a claim to a genus
of DNA molecules not supported by written description
of a method for obtaining the molecules);
cf. Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1567-68 (holding claims to
a broad genus of genetic material invalid because
the specification disclosed only one particular species).
Ariad attempts to categorically distinguish
Rochester, Fiers, and Eli Lilly, because in those
cases, the claims explicitly included the non-
described compositions. For example, in Rochester,
the method claims recited a broad type of compound
that we held was inadequately described in
the specification of the patent:
1. A method for selectively inhibiting PGHS-2
activity in a human host, comprising administering
a non-steroidal compound that selectively inhibits
activity of the PGHS-2 gene product to a
human host in need of such treatment.
Id. at 918 (emphasis added). Ariad's attempt to
distinguish these cases is unavailing. Regardless of
whether the asserted claims recite a compound,
Ariad still must describe some way of performing
the claimed methods, and Ariad admits that the specification
suggests only the use of the three classes
of molecules to achieve NF-KB reduction. Thus, to
satisfy the written description requirement for the
asserted claims, the specification must demonstrate
that Ariad possessed the claimed methods by sufficiently
disclosing molecules capable of reducing
NF-KB activity so as to satisfy the inventor's obligation
to disclose the technologic knowledge upon
which the patent is based, and to demonstrate that
the patentee was in possession of the invention that
is claimed. Capon, 418 F.3d at 1357.
B.
[13] Alternatively, Ariad argues that the specification
of the ' 516 patent and the expert testimony
of Tom Kadesch provided the jury with substantial
evidence of adequate written description of
the claimed methods. A determination that a patent
is invalid for failure to meet the written descrip

tion requirement of 35 U.S.C.  112,  1 is a question
of fact, and we review a jury's determinations
of facts relating to compliance with the written description
requirement for substantial evidence.
PIN/NIP, Inc. v. Platte Chem. Co., 304 F.3d 1235,
1243 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing Vas-Cath, 935 F.2d at
1563).
Much of Ariad's written description evidence,
however, is legally irrelevant to the question of
whether the disclosure of the '516 patent conveys to
those skilled in the art that the inventors were in
possession of the claimed invention on April 21,
*1374 1989-the effective filing date of the '516 patent.
The parties disputed the effective filing date of
the '516 patent, and in a detailed and well-crafted
special verdict form, the jury was asked to choose
between the two possible dates: April 21, 1989 and
November 13, 1991. The jury chose 1989 and
neither party appealed that determination. Presumably
because of uncertainty over the priority date,
much of Ariad's evidence was actually directed to
the later date. Because written description is determined
as of the filing date-April 21, 1989 in this
case-evidence of what one of ordinary skill in the
art knew in 1990 or 1991 cannot provide substantial
evidence to the jury that the asserted claims were
supported by adequate written description. See Vas-
Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64 (holding that a written
description analysis occurs as of the filing date
sought).
In accordance with Rochester, the '516 patent
must adequately describe the claimed methods for
reducing NF-KB activity, including adequate description
of the molecules that Ariad admits are necessary
to perform the methods. The specification
of the '516 patent hypothesizes three classes of molecules
potentially capable of reducing NF-KB
activity: specific inhibitors, dominantly interfering
molecules, and decoy molecules. We review the
specification's disclosure of each in turn to determine
whether there is substantial evidence to support
the jury's verdict that the written description evidenced
that the inventor possessed the claimed in
vention.
Specific inhibitors are molecules that are able
to block (reduce or eliminate) NF-KB binding to
DNA in the nucleus. '516 patent col.37 ll.44-45.
The only example of a specific inhibitor given in
the specification is I-KB, a naturally occurring molecule
whose function is to hold NF-KB in an inactive
state until the cell receives certain external influences.
Id. at col.37 ll.48-49. Nearly all of Ariad's
evidence regarding the disclosure of I-KB relies
upon figure 43. Ariad's expert, Dr. Kadesch, testified
that figure 43 discloses the sequence of DNA
that encodes I-KB and relied on this disclosure with
regard to his opinion that the written description requirement
was satisfied by disclosure of specific inhibitor
molecules. See Trial Tr. 53; 57-58; 60;
78-85, Apr. 27, 2006. But as Ariad admits, figure
43 was not disclosed until 1991. Because figure 43
was not in the 1989 application, neither it nor Dr.
Kadesch's testimony regarding it can offer substantial
evidence for the jury determination. See Vas-
Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64. The only other testimony
of Dr. Kadesch with regard to I-KB was that
it existed in 1989 and that one of ordinary skill
could through experimentation isolate natural I-KB.
See Trial Tr. at 62-85. In the context of this invention,
a vague functional description and an invitation
for further research does not constitute written
FN1
disclosure of a specific inhibitor.See Eli Lilly,
119 F.3d at 1566 (holding that written description
requires more than a mere wish or plan for obtaining
the claimed chemical invention); see also id. at
1567 ([A] description which renders obvious a
claimed invention is not sufficient to satisfy the
written description requirement of that invention.).
And it certainly does not *1375 constitute written
disclosure of a method for reducing NF-KB activity
using I-KB.
FN1. Moreover, the district court found, in
the context of its inequitable conduct ruling,
that figure 43 is both incorrect and incomplete.

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366)
That the inventors of the '516 patent,
among the most skilled artisans in their
field in the world at this time, failed to correctly
disclose the structure of I-B even
K
two years after the application was filed is
a strong sign that one of skill in the art
could not be expected to provide this
knowledge in 1989.
Dominantly interfering molecules are a truncated
form of the NF-KB molecule. '516 patent
col.38 l.11. The truncation would retain[ ] the
DNA binding domain, but lack[ ] the RNA polymerase
activating domain. Id. at col.38 ll.13-14.
As such, the dominantly interfering molecule
would recognize and bind to the NF-KB binding
site [on nuclear DNA], however, the binding would
be unproductive. Id. at col.38 ll.15-17. In other
words, the dominantly interfering molecules would
block natural NF-KB from inducing the expression
of its target genes. The specification provides no
example molecules of this class. Moreover, the specification
acknowledges that dominantly interfering
molecules can work only if the DNA binding domain
and the DNA polymerase domain of NF-KB
are spatially distinct in the molecule. Id. at col.38
ll.9-10 (emphasis added). The jury also heard Dr.
Kadesch's testimony that it is a fair representation
that the '516 patent itself doesn't disclose in its text
that the DNA binding domain and the RNA preliminary
activating domain of NF-KB are, in fact, separable
or spatially distinct. Considering that the inventors
of the '516 patent discovered NF-KB, if
they did not know whether the two domains are distinct,
one of ordinary skill in the art was at best
equally ignorant. Perhaps one of ordinary skill
could discover this information, but this does not
alter our conclusion that the description of the dominantly
interfering molecules just represents a
wish, or arguably a plan for future research. Fiers,
984 F.2d at 1171; see Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1567
(rendering obvious is insufficient for written description).
Nor is it sufficient, as Ariad argues, that
skilled workers actually practiced this teaching
soon after the 1989 application was filed. See Vas-
Cath, 935 F.2d at 1563-64 (holding that a written
description analysis occurs as of the filing date
sought).
Decoy molecules are designed to mimic a region
of the gene whose expression would normally
be induced by NF-KB. In this case, NF-KB would
bind the decoy, and thus, not be available to bind its
natural target. '516 patent col.37 ll.51-54. Like the
other two classes of molecules, decoy molecules
are presented hypothetically, but unlike the other
two classes of molecules, the specification proposes
example structures for decoy molecules. Id. at
col.37 tbl.2. As Dr. Kadesch explained, decoy molecules
are DNA oligonucleotides, and because the
specification discloses specific example sequences,
there is little doubt that the specification adequately
described the actual molecules to one of ordinary
skill in the art. Yet this does not answer the question
of whether the specification adequately describes
using those molecules to reduce NF-KB
activity. The full extent of the specification's disclosure
of a method that reduces NF-KB activity
using decoy molecules is that NF-KB would bind
the decoy and thereby, negative regulation can be
effected. Id. at col.37 ll.50-54. Prophetic examples
are routinely used in the chemical arts, and they
certainly can be sufficient to satisfy the written description
requirement. But this disclosure is not so
much an example as it is a mere mention of a desired
outcome. As Dr. Latchman pointed out, there
is no descriptive link between the table of decoy
molecules and reducing NF-KB activity.
Ariad also relies upon [a] 1990 publication in
evidence [that] reported using decoy molecules to
reduce NF-KB activity which was discussed by
Dr. Kadesch. Appellee Br. 25-26. Again, because
the priority date was determined to be 1989, the
disclosure in a later publication cannot, as a matter
of law, establish that the inventor in this case possessed
using decoy molecules*1376 to reduce NFKB
when the patent application was filed in 1989.
Dr. Kadesch's reliance on this evidence as support
FN2
for his opinion is likewise erroneous.

FN2. Dr. Kadesch testified that the scientists
who conducted the decoy molecule
study published in November 1990 would
likely have mastered their technique prior
to the filing of the '516 patent application
in April 1989. Perhaps so, but this fact is
not in evidence, and even if it were true,
one research group does not necessarily
represent the knowledge of one of ordinary
skill in the art without further testimony to
support that contention.
We reviewed all other portions of Dr. Kadesch's
testimony that Ariad contends provided the
jury with substantial evidence relating to each of
the three classes of molecules, and we deem them
FN3
insufficient as a matter of law. Indeed, most of
the testimony cited by Ariad was irrelevant to the
question of whether the inventors were in possession
of the claimed invention as of the 1989 priority
date. The '516 patent discloses no working or even
prophetic examples of methods that reduce NF-KB
activity, and no completed syntheses of any of the
molecules prophesized to be capable of reducing
NF-KB activity. The state of the art at the time of
filing was primitive and uncertain, leaving Ariad
with an insufficient supply of prior art knowledge
with which to fill the gaping holes in its disclosure.
See Capon, 418 F.3d at 1358 (It is well-recognized
that in the unpredictable fields of science, it is appropriate
to recognize the variability in the science
in determining the scope of the coverage to which
the inventor is entitled.).
FN3. Dr. Kadesch certainly offered a general
conclusion that he thought the inventors
were in possession of the claimed invention
in 1989. This conclusory testimony,
as shown infra, is devoid of any factual
content upon which the jury could
have relied when considering the specification
of the '516 patent, and therefore cannot
constitute substantial evidence. Besides,
possession of an invention must be
shown by written description in the patent
application, and that was not shown here.
See Rochester, 358 F.3d at 926 (After all,
it is in the patent specification where the
written description requirement must be
met.).
Whatever thin thread of support a jury might
find in the decoy-molecule hypothetical simply
cannot bear the weight of the vast scope of these
generic claims. See LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res.
Mapping, Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2005)
(holding that [a]fter reading the patent, a person of
skill in the art would not understand the patentee
to have invented a generic method where the patent
only disclosed one embodiment of it); Reiffin, 214
F.3d at 1345-46 (noting that the scope of the right
to exclude must not overreach the scope of the inventor's
contribution to the field of art as described
in the patent specification); Fiers, 984 F.2d at
1171 (Claiming all DNA[s] that achieve a result
without defining what means will do so is not in
compliance with the description requirement; it is
an attempt to preempt the future before it has arrived.);
cf. Carnegie Mellon, 541 F.3d at 1126
(holding that the narrow description of the E. coli
polA gene did not adequately support a broad claim
to the gene from any bacterial source). Here, the
specification at best describes decoy molecule
structures and hypothesizes with no accompanying
description that they could be used to reduce NFKB
activity. Yet the asserted claims are far broader.
We therefore conclude that the jury lacked substantial
evidence for its verdict that the asserted claims
were supported by adequate written description,
and thus hold the asserted claims invalid.
Ariad sought and obtained the broad claims we
now hold to be invalid. For its own reasons, Ariad
maintained the breadth of these claims through
claim construction and into trial. As Judge Rader
observed, *1377 the situation presented in this case
should not often occur, because [i]n simple terms,
a court would properly interpret the claim[s] as limited.

denial of petition for rehearing en banc). Nonetheless,
as it stands, Ariad chose to assert claims that
are broad far beyond the scope of the disclosure
provided in the specification of the '516 patent. Cf.
Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 481 F.3d

[14] We next turn to Lilly's appeal of the district
court's ruling that Lilly failed to establish the
affirmative defense of inequitable conduct. We review
the district court's findings on the issues of
materiality and intent for clear error. The ultimate
decision regarding inequitable conduct is reviewed
for abuse of discretion. Rentrop v. Spectranetics
Corp., No.2007-1560, 550 F.3d 1112, 1120
(Fed.Cir. Dec.18, 2008).
[15] Lilly bears the burden of proving inequitable
conduct. Ulead Sys., Inc. v. Lex Computer &
Mgmt. Corp., 351 F.3d 1139, 1146 (Fed.Cir.2003).
To successfully prove inequitable conduct, Lilly
must present evidence that the applicant (1) made
an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact,
failed to disclose material information, or submitted
false material information, and (2) intended to deceive
the [USPTO]. Cargill, Inc. v. Canbra Foods,
Ltd., 476 F.3d 1359, 1364-65 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc., 468 F.3d
1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006)).
[16] Further, at least a threshold level of each
element-i.e., both materiality and intent to deceive-
must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
Star Scientific, Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
537 F.3d 1357, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2008). If a threshold
level of intent to deceive or materiality is not established
by clear and convincing evidence, the district
court does not have any discretion to exercise and
cannot hold the patent unenforceable regardless of
the relative equities or how it might balance them.
Id. Lilly alleges that two errors gave rise to inequitable
conduct. On appeal, Ariad does not dispute the
substance or materiality of the errors. Rather, relying
on Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles Machine
Works, Lilly challenges the district court's finding
that neither error was accompanied by an intent to
deceive. 437 F.3d 1309, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2006) ([A]
greater showing of [materiality] allow[s for] a lesser
showing of [intent].). Unless otherwise noted,
the facts are taken from the district court's detailed
opinion. Ariad Pharms., Inc., 529 F.Supp.2d at
121-36.
A.
[17] The first of the two errors underlying
Lilly's defense of inequitable conduct relates to figure
43 of the '516 patent. Ariad does not dispute the
district court's finding that figure 43 is incorrect.
The patent describes figure 43 as [t]he nucleotide
sequence of the I-KB- gene and the amino acid sequence
of I-KB-. '516 patent col.28 ll.16-17. The
district court found that one of ordinary skill in the
art would, given the context, infer that the gene in
figure 43 is that of a mouse or other mammal.
There are two errors in the figure: the sequence is
both incomplete and from a chicken as opposed to a
mouse or other mammalian organism. The district
court further found that the errors were material because
during prosecution, Ariad and the examiner
relied on figure 43 for certain arguments to overcome
112 rejections. Ariad does not dispute the
materiality of the errors. According to Lilly, *1378
the district court clearly erred because Ariad and
the prosecuting attorneys were aware of the errors
in figure 43 and purposely concealed them from the
USPTO at the crowning moment of the prosecution
of the '516 patent.
Figure 43 was added to the specification of a
predecessor application of the '516 patent in 1991.
Without detailing the full lineage, it is sufficient to
note that several related applications in the family
contained figure 43. In 1997, an employee of Ariad,
Sharon Hausdorff, informed Lisa Warren, an attorney
with Hamilton, Brooks, Smith & Reynolds,
P.C., that figure 43 contained errors. Ms. Warren
succeeded in deleting figure 43 from at least one
application on file with the USPTO. Around the
same time, the prosecution files for the family of

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1366)
applications were transferred to Matthew Vincent at
Foley, Hoag & Elliot LLP.
Dr. Vincent delegated the work to Isabelle
Clauss. Dr. Clauss handled the ministerial actions,
including, upon learning of the errors from
Ms. Hausdorff, removing figure 43 from two more
of the related applications. Although Dr. Vincent
testified that he was never aware of the errors in
figure 43 during the pendency of the application
that led to the '516 patent, Dr. Clauss testified that
she had discussed the issue regarding figure 43 with
him. The district court credited Dr. Vincent's testimony
because Dr. Class was at best, equivocal
and was uncertain about the timing and substance
of the conversations. In 1998, Dr. Vincent filed a
response to an office action regarding the '516 patent
application. While apparently not referencing
figure 43, Dr. Vincent made arguments relating to
112 that would be furthered by figure 43. Dr.
Clauss also filed a similar response in 1999, arguing
that the specification of the application disclosed
I-KBencoding DNA. Although she did not
reference it explicitly, she could only have been referring
to the contents of figure 43.
In 2001, Dr. Vincent moved to Ropes & Gray
LLP, taking with him all of the related applications.
Dr. Clauss did not move to Ropes & Gray LLP and
did no further work on the Ariad patent applications.
After this, no further corrections were made,
and the '516 patent issued in 2002 with figure 43 included.
[18] The district court did not clearly err by
finding no intent to deceive the USPTO by Ms.
Hausdorff, Dr. Vincent, or Dr. Clauss. While it is
true that because direct evidence of deceptive intent
is rarely available, such intent can be inferred
from indirect and circumstantial evidence[,] ... such
evidence must still be clear and convincing, and inferences
drawn from lesser evidence cannot satisfy
the deceptive intent requirement. Star Scientific,
537 F.3d at 1366.
Dr. Vincent never knew of the errors. Thus, to
the extent that he may have relied on figure 43 in
his communications with the USPTO, this is insufficient
evidence of intent to deceive. Ms. Hausdorff
knew, but there is no other evidence that Ms. Hausdorff
had any intent to conceal the errors from the
USPTO. To the contrary, she disclosed the errors to
her attorneys. She was justified in her expectation
that her attorneys would determine the legal significance
of the errors and take appropriate actions.
Dr. Clauss also knew of the errors, but the district
court credited Dr. Clauss's testimony that she was
following Foley, Hoag & Elliot LLP's standard
practice to make the correction only after the PTO
indicated the claims were allowable in any particular
related application. That knowledge of the errors
was lost when Dr. Vincent moved to Ropes & Gray
LLP does not rise to the level of intent to deceive.
See *1379Kingsdown Med. Consultants, Ltd. v.
Hollister Inc., 863 F.2d 867, 876 (Fed.Cir.1988) (en
banc) (holding even gross negligence insufficient to
prove intent to deceive). While Dr. Clauss's 1999
office action response could be the seed of a finding
of intent, more evidence of deliberate concealment
would be needed and this fact alone does not
constitute clear error in the district court fact
finding.
Lilly argues that the fact that figure 43 was left
in the one application that issued as the '516 patent
is sufficiently suspicious that it should contribute to
a finding of intent. We disagree. It appears that the
parties involved endeavored to correct figure 43
throughout the family of applications. These actions
do not signal a nefarious plot to leave figure 43 in
the one application that would lead to the patent
now asserted; rather, they signal an honest but imperfect
attempt to correct mistakes. Certainly, deceptive
intent is not the single most reasonable inference
able to be drawn from the evidence. Star

evidence of what Lilly contends is purposeful concealment
no matter how material the errors might
be.

[19] The second of the two errors underlying
Lilly's defense of inequitable conduct relates to the
failure to submit four references to the USPTO during
the prosecution of the '516 patent application.
The references were not prior art per se; they were
scientific papers published after the filing date of
the '516 patent application and authored or coauthored
by one of the patent's co-inventors, Albert
Baldwin. The references discuss the impact of various
compounds on NF-B activity. According to
K
Lilly, the references are relevant to the issue of
whether certain claims are inherently anticipated by
these prior art compounds. Ariad does not dispute
the district court's finding that the omissions were
material. Lilly argues that Ariad intentionally concealed
the references, pointing to testimony by Dr.
Baldwin that he knew the references were relevant
to the subject matter of the '516 patent application.
Lilly does not claim that any other person had the
requisite intent.
There is no doubt that Dr. Baldwin was aware
of the references, because he authored them. He
testified as follows:
Q. Did you at any time consider disclosing your
findings regarding Resveratrol in those experiments
to the United States Patent Office?
A. I mean I-I considered it, but I-again, I feel like
that one would inundate the patent office with
every report of-of things that affect NF-KB one
way or the other. It's-you can do a search on NFKB
and it's endless.
Q. Why is it you considered disclosing your findings
regarding the effect of Resveratrol in your
experiments to the United States Patent Office?
A. Well, we signed-we signed this document that
says that was our obligation to do so at some
point.
Dr. Baldwin-who is a scientist and not a patent
lawyer-was apparently aware of his duty to disclose,
and also aware that it could be inappropriate
to submit material that might inundate the
USPTO. His reasons for not submitting the references
are plausible, even if ultimately legally incorrect,
and Lilly failed to show that deceptive intent
was the better explanation for Dr. Baldwin's behavior.
Lilly failed to show that Dr. Baldwin had any
knowledge of how the statements about the effect
of prior art compounds on NF-KB activity made in
the references could impact the '516 patent application.
Lilly did not show that Dr. Baldwin appreciated
the inherent anticipation theory to which the
references allegedly pertained. And even if Lilly
had shown this knowledge, it did not show that Dr.
Baldwin had any knowledge of the historical uses
of the prior art compounds. *1380 Accordingly, we
conclude that the district court did not clearly err by
finding no intent to deceive the USPTO on the part
of Dr. Baldwin.
C.
[20][21] Lilly cannot prove deceptive intent by
clear and convincing evidence simply by relying on
the materiality of the errors. Rather, there must be
clear and convincing evidence of culpable conduct.

925 F.2d 1435, 1443 (Fed.Cir.1991) (citing Consol.
Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int'l Ltd., 910 F.2d 804,
809 (Fed.Cir.1990)). Digital Control's statement
that a greater showing of [materiality] allow[s for]
a lesser showing of [intent] is not to the contrary.
437 F.3d at 1313. Only after a district court makes
independent findings of both materiality and intent
may it weigh the two against each other in its ultimate
determination of inequitable conduct. Materiality
and intent are different requirements, and absent
a finding of deceptive intent, no amount of materiality
gives the district court discretion to find inequitable
conduct. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365
(If a threshold level of intent to deceive or materiality
is not established by clear and convincing
evidence, the district court does not have any discretion
to exercise and cannot hold the patent unenforceable
regardless of the relative equities or
how it might balance them.); see Aventis Pharma

the Kingsdown rule has revived the inequitable conduct
tactic.). [C]ourts must be vigilant in not permitting
the defense [of inequitable conduct] to be
applied too lightly. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at
1366. Because Lilly failed to establish the
threshold level of intent to deceive ... by clear and
convincing evidence, the district correct correctly
concluded that the '516 patent was not unenforceable
due to inequitable conduct. Id. at 1365.
CONCLUSION
Because we hold that claims 80, 95, 144, and
145 of the '516 patent are invalid for lack of written
description, we need not address infringement or
the other validity issues on appeal. We affirm the
district court's ruling that the '516 patent is not unenforceable
due to inequitable conduct. The judgment
below is
REVERSED-IN-PART AND AFFIRMEDIN-
PART.
LINN, Circuit Judge, concurring.
I join the opinion of the court because I concur
that it is supported by our precedent. I write separately
to emphasize, as I have before, my belief that
our engrafting of a separate written description requirement
onto section 112, paragraph 1 is misguided.
See, e.g., Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle
& Co., Inc., 375 F.3d 1303, 1325-27 (Fed.Cir.2004)
(Linn, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en
banc); Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe Inc., 323
F.3d 956, 987-89 (Fed.Cir.2002) (Linn, J., dissenting
from denial of rehearing en banc). As I observed
in University of Rochester, section 112,
paragraph 1 requires no more of the specification
than a disclosure that is sufficient to enable a person
having ordinary skill in the art to make and use
the invention:
Section 112 of Title 35 of the United States
Code requires a written description of the invention,
but the measure of the sufficiency of that
written description in meeting the conditions of
patentability in paragraph 1 of that statute depends
solely on whether it enables any person
skilled in the art to which the invention pertains
to make and use the claimed invention and sets
forth the best mode of carrying out the invention.
The question presented by *138135 U.S.C.  112,
paragraph 1, is not, Does the written description
disclose what the invention is? The question is,
Does the written description describe the invention
recited in the claims-themselves part of the
specification-in terms that are sufficient to enable
one of skill in the art to make and use the claimed
invention and practice the best mode contemplated
by the inventor? That is the mandate of
the statute and is all our precedent demanded prior
to Regents of the University of California v.
Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559 (Fed.Cir.1997).
375 F.3d at 1325.
As both this court and the Supreme Court have
recognized, the claims-not the specification-define
the invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top
Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 339, 81 S.Ct. 599,
5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961) ([T]he claims made in the
patent are the sole measure of the grant.); see also
Johnson & Johnston Assocs. Inc. v. R.E. Serv. Co.,
285 F.3d 1046, 1052 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc)
(Consistent with its scope definition and notice
functions, the claim requirement presupposes that a
patent applicant defines his invention in the claims,
not in the specification. After all, the claims, not
the specification, provide the measure of the pat-
entee's right to exclude.). The court's invention of
a separate written description requirement has
create[d] confusion as to where the public and the
courts should look to determine the scope of the
patentee's right to exclude, University of
Rochester, 375 F.3d at 1326, causing uncertainty
in how inventions are protected, in how the [Patent
& Trademark Office] discharges its responsibilities,
and in how business is conducted in emerging
fields of law, id. at 1327.
Aside from these general observations, I note
that the written description requirement does separ

ate mischief in this case. Because the court relies
upon this requirement to reverse the district court, it
does not reach the important enablement issue
raised by Lilly. As the majority opinion observes,
the claims-in-suit broadly claim any method for reducing
NF-KB activity in cells, including both
known and unknown methods. We have long held
that in order to survive the enablement requirement,
the specification must describe the manner and
process of making and using the invention so as to
enable a person of skill in the art to make and use
the full scope of the invention without undue experimentation.

Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1344-45 (Fed.Cir.2005)
(emphasis added); see also Invitrogen Corp. v.
Clontech Labs., Inc., 429 F.3d 1052, 1070
(Fed.Cir.2005). To my knowledge, however, we
have not specifically addressed this requirement in
relation to the type of claims at issue here-that is,
claims written broadly enough to cover any method
for achieving a particular result. It may be, as Lilly
argues, that such a claim can never be valid, since
the specification cannot enable unknown methods.
Cf. In re Hyatt, 708 F.2d 712, 714 (Fed.Cir.1983)
(rejecting single means claim, as such claims
cover[ ] every conceivable means for achieving
the stated result). This is an important issue that
we have left unresolved. It is an issue that we
would have been compelled to reach had the case
been decided on enablement grounds, a basis found
in section 112, instead of on written description
grounds, a separate basis not justified under that
section or any other provision of the Patent Act.
