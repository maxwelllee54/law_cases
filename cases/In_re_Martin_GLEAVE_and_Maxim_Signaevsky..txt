United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
In re Martin GLEAVE and Maxim Signaevsky.
No. 2008-1453.
March 26, 2009.
Background: Examiner rejected some claims in
patent application as indefinite and others as anticipated
or obvious. The Patent and Trademark Office
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences,
2008 WL 867799, reversed examiner's indefinite
rejection and affirmed anticipated or obvious rejection.
Applicants petitioned for judicial review.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) prior patent application that disclosed general
concepts regarding antisense oligonucleotides was
enabling disclosure;
(2) evidence as to whether particular prior art compounds
worked for their intended purpose was irrelevant
to anticipation analysis; and
(3) prior art reference that listed every 15-base
sense oligodeoxynucleotide in known nucleic acid
sequence anticipated and rendered obvious claims
to specific antisense sequences having particular
properties.
Affirmed.

*1333 Ex parte Gleave, No.2007-4154, 2008
WL 867799 (B.P.A.I. Mar. 31, 2008). Gleave appeals
the  102/103 rejections. For the reasons set
forth below, we affirm.
BACKGROUND
Gleave's '493 application is entitled Bispecific
Antisense Olignucleotides [sic] that Inhibit IGFBP
FN1
2 and IGFBP-5 and Methods of Using Same.
The claims are based on the understanding that certain
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can simultaneously
bind to and prevent the translation of mRNA
into two types of human Insulin-Dependent Growth
Factor Binding Protein (IGFBP). The application
claims antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, methods of
making pharmaceutical compounds containing the
oligodeoxynucleotides, and methods of treating endocrine-
regulated cancers by using the oligodeoxynucleotides
to prevent the formation of IGFBP-2
and IGFBP-5. The examiner rejected claims 1, 4,
15, and 18-21, all of which were composition
claims directed to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides.
FN1. We described antisense technology in
greater detail in Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Cal-
gene, Inc., 188 F.3d 1362 (Fed.Cir.1999),
and thus only give a brief overview for
purposes of this opinion. In double-stranded
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), only
particular segments (called genes) actually
encode proteins. Typically, this double-
stranded DNA is transcribed into messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which
is complementary to one strand of the
DNA. This mRNA then moves into the ribosome,
where the mRNA is translated
into a series of amino acids. Together,
these amino acids form a single protein.
Antisense technology is used to interrupt
this process, thereby preventing certain
proteins from being synthesized by the
cell. Short segments of single-stranded
DNA (called oligodeoxynucleotides) that
are complementary to the mRNA are introduced,
and physically bind to the mRNA.
This prevents the mRNA from being translated
into a protein. Some of these oligodeoxynucleotides
are bispecific,
meaning that they can bind to mRNAs
transcribed from two distinct genes and
prevent the formation of both proteins.
The Board selected claims 1 and 4 as representative.
Claim 1 recites
[a] bispecific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide,
wherein substantially all of the oligodeoxynucleotide
is complementary to a portion of a gene
encoding human IGFBP-2 and substantially all of
the oligodeoxynucleotide is also complementary
to a gene encoding human IGFBP-5, and wherein
the oligodeoxynucleotide is of sufficient length to
act as an antisense inhibitor of human IGFBP-2
and human IGFBP-5.
Claim 4 recites [t]he antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
according to claim 1, wherein the oligodeoxynucleotide
consists essentially of a series
of bases as set forth in any of Seq. ID. Nos. 3
through 7. Those sequences range from eighteen to
twenty-two DNA bases in length. Before the examiner,
Gleave elected Sequence No. 5, a twenty-base
oligodeoxynucleotide. The specification notes that
the invention does not exclude minor modifications
in sequence, such as the addition of one or
two terminal bases, or single base substitutions
which might depart from perfect complementarity.
The examiner initially rejected the claims over
the published PCT application 00/78341 of Wraight
et al. (Wraight). In Wraight, the applicants listed
every fifteen-base-long sense oligodeoxynucleotide
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 5
560 F.3d 1331, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1235
(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1331)
in the IGFBP-2 gene. The list includes more than
1400 sequences. Wraight also disclosed the general
concepts that antisense oligonucleotides are preferably
between fifteen and twenty-five bases in
length, and that some antisense oligonucleotides
may be bispecific (i.e., capable of inhibiting an
IGFBP such as IGFBP-2 and/or IGFBP-3). Finally,
Wraight states that [a]ntisense oligonucleotides
to IGFBP-2 may be selected from molecules
capable of interacting with one or more of
*1334 the sense oligonucleotides described in the
long list.
The Board found that to anticipate claim 1, the
prior art had to describe an oligodeoxynucleotide of
sufficient length to act as an antisense inhibitor to
human IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5, and substantially all
of the oligodeoxynucleotide had to be complementary
to a portion of the gene encoding human IGFBP-
2 and complementary to the gene encoding human
IGFBP-5. The Board found that Wraight satisfied
these requirements and anticipated the claims.
The Board also affirmed the  103 rejection.
The issue presented on appeal, therefore, is
whether a reference that lists every fifteen-base
sense oligodeoxynucleotide in a known nucleic acid
sequence anticipates or renders obvious claims to
specific antisense sequences having particular properties.
We have jurisdiction over the appeal under
28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(4)(A).
DISCUSSION
As an initial matter, the parties disagree over
the proper standard of review. Under 35 U.S.C.
102(b), a patent applicant cannot receive a patent if
the invention was described in a printed publication
in this or a foreign country ... more than one
year prior to the date of the application for patent in
the United States. Gleave claims that the issue at
hand is in essence one of statutory construction
(i.e., what a reference must disclose to describe
an invention under  102(b)); thus, Gleave argues
FN2
we should review the Board's decision de novo.
Yet Gleave has not unearthed for us some previously
hidden requirement for a reference to anticip
ate an invention under  102(b).
FN2. The PTO argued that Gleave waived
review of the legal issue he now asserts by
failing to raise it before the Board. We
disagree. The entire thrust of Gleave's brief
on appeal to the Board was the
significance of Wraight's disclosure in
an anticipation analysis. Gleave argued
this position as early as his first office action
response on March 12, 2005.
[1][2] A reference is anticipatory under
102(b) when it satisfies particular requirements.
First, the reference must disclose each and every
element of the claimed invention, whether it does
so explicitly or inherently. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith
Goldline Pharms., Inc., 471 F.3d 1369, 1375
(Fed.Cir.2006). While those elements must be
arranged or combined in the same way as in the
claim, Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545
F.3d 1359, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2008), the reference need
not satisfy an ipsissimis verbis test, In re Bond, 910
F.2d 831, 832-33 (Fed.Cir.1990). Second, the reference
must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to
make the invention without undue experimentation.
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc.,
545 F.3d 1312, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2008); see In re
LeGrice, 49 C.C.P.A. 1124, 301 F.2d 929, 940-44
(1962). As long as the reference discloses all of the
claim limitations and enables the subject matter
that falls within the scope of the claims at issue,
the reference anticipates-no actual creation or reduction
to practice is required. Schering Corp. v.
Geneva Pharms., Inc., 339 F.3d 1373, 1380-81
(Fed.Cir.2003); see In re Donohue, 766 F.2d 531,
533 (Fed.Cir.1985). This is so despite the fact that
the description provided in the anticipating reference
might not otherwise entitle its author to a patent.
See Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555,
1562 (Fed.Cir.1991) (discussing the distinction
between a written description adequate to support a
claim under  112 and a written description sufficient
to anticipate its subject matter under  102(b)
).

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1331)
[3][4] As this summary makes clear, the outcome
in this case depends largely on the facts.
After all, anticipation is a *1335 question of fact,
including whether an element is inherent in the prior
art. Eli Lilly, 471 F.3d at 1375. And as with 35
U.S.C.  112, [w]hether a prior art reference is enabling
is a question of law based upon underlying
factual findings. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v.
Chemque, Inc., 303 F.3d 1294, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2002)
. We review the Board's factual determinations for
substantial evidence. In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305,
1315 (Fed.Cir.2000). The Board's legal conclusions,
on the other hand, we review de novo. In re
Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125, 1127 (Fed.Cir.2004).
A
Gleave frames the issue presented for review as
the meaning of the term described in 35 U.S.C.
102(b) and the type of disclosure that is therefore
required for a reference to be anticipatory. Specifically,
Gleave claims that Wraight does not describe
any particular individual antisense species,
because Wraight merely gives the public ink,
formed into strings of letters, without inventive
thought and without placing the public in possession
of anything new. There is no guidance to make
particular selections, and no understanding of
which of the targets would be useful, and what the
properties of the related antisense would be.
[5] We have at times framed the issue of enablement
under  102 as a question of whether one
of ordinary skill in the art would know how to
make and use  the invention based on the reference's
disclosure. See, e.g., Impax Labs., Inc. v.
Aventis Pharms., Inc., 468 F.3d 1366, 1381
(Fed.Cir.2006) ([A] prior art reference must be enabling
so that the claimed subject matter may be
made or used by one skilled in the art.); Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs., Inc., 246
F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2001) ( To anticipate,
the reference must also enable one of skill in the art
to make and use the claimed invention.). Taken
out of context, these formulations of our  102 enablement
standard arguably support a use or utility
requirement divorced from any make requirement.
A thorough reading of our case law, however,
makes clear that a reference need disclose no independent
use or utility to anticipate a claim under
102. E.g., Novo Nordisk Pharms., Inc. v. Bio-Tech.
Gen. Corp., 424 F.3d 1347, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2005)
(The standard for enablement of a prior art reference
for purposes of anticipation under [ ]102 differs
from the enablement standard under 35 U.S.C.
112.); Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,
413 F.3d 1318, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2005) ( [A] prior art
reference need not demonstrate utility in order to
serve as an anticipating reference under [ ]102.);
In re Hafner, 56 C.C.P.A. 1424, 410 F.2d 1403,
1405 (1969) ([Section] 112 provides that the specification
must enable one skilled in the art to use
the invention whereas  102 makes no such requirement
as to an anticipatory disclosure.).
[6][7][8] The confusion stems from the fact
that where a method claim is at issue, it is a largely
meaningless formulation of the standard to require
a reference to disclose how to make that method
in order to anticipate. For method claims, the
make requirement becomes, in effect, a use requirement.
The only way one can show that a reference
enables the method is to show that a person of
ordinary skill would know how to use-in other
words, to practice or to carry out-the method in
light of the reference. This does not mean, however,
that the prior art reference must demonstrate the invention's
utility. For instance, in the context of a
claimed method for treating a disease, a prior art
reference need not disclose proof of efficacy to
anticipate the claim. Impax Labs., 545 F.3d at 1315;
Rasmusson, 413 F.3d at 1326. Gleave's claims are
*1336 to compositions of matter-oligonucleotides-
and therefore a reference satisfies the
enablement requirement of  102(b) by showing
that one of skill in the art would know how to make
the relevant sequences disclosed in Wraight. Thus,
the fact that Wraight provides no understanding of
which of the targets would be useful is of no import,
because Gleave admits that it is well within
the skill of an ordinary person in the art to make

(Cite as: 560 F.3d 1331)
any oligodeoxynucleotide sequence. See Appellant's
Br. 10. As such, Wraight is an enabling disclosure
sufficient to anticipate Gleave's invention
under  102(b).
[9] Gleave also points out that [n]o example
of an actual antisense oligonucleotide complementary
to a sequence on [Wraight's] list is shown to
have antisense activity. Id. at 4. We need not address
any inherency issues, however, because the
simple fact is that Gleave's composition claims do
not require antisense activity either. The claims at
issue merely require the oligodeoxynucleotides to
be of sufficient length to act as an antisense inhibitor
of human IGFBP-2 and human IGFBP-5. See
Oral Arg. at 1:18, available at http:// oralarguments.
cafc. uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2008-1453. mp 3
(Judge Prost: I'm a little confused by this, and I
guess turning to the language in claim 1, doesn't it
just disclose an oligo of sufficient length to act as
an antisense inhibitor? And I'm not seeing where
the language requires that the oligo actually acts as
an antisense inhibitor. Gleave's counsel: No, it
doesn't.). As explained above, evidence as to
whether particular compounds work for their intended
purpose is irrelevant to our  102(b) analysis.
Certainly where the claims themselves do not require
a particular activity, we have no call to require
something more from the anticipating reference.
B
[10] At its core, Gleave's primary argument is
rooted in policy:
Where the allegedly anticipatory disclosure is
only a small part of a much larger and exhaustive
listing and there is no basis in the art for selecting
some individual members of the listing over others,
what is actually described and what is actually
disclosed to the public is no more than the
generic concept underlying the list.
Appellant's Br. 6. In other words, Gleave argues
that we should collapse the distinction
between a list and a genus disclosure. See Oral Arg.
at 4:42, available at http:// oralarguments. cafc.
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2008-1453. mp 3 (Judge
Moore: I understand what you're saying-from a
policy perspective, you'd like us to say when a list
gets long enough, you ought to treat them the
same. Gleave's counsel: No, I'm not even saying
when a list gets long enough. I'm saying when a list
provides no more information to an inve-to the public
than the generic statement would.) If we did,
the argument goes, then we would recognize that
Wraight simply provides a long winded form of a
statement that you could make antisense that targets
IGFBP-2.
Gleave also cites In re Wiggins for the proposition
that a list of compounds, without any direction
as to selection among the targets, is not a description
of any one of these targets. Gleave urges
us to find that Wiggins clearly expressed the
policy concerns which this case exemplifies, that
giving prior art effect to individual members of lists
of thousands of theoretically possible compounds
would be contrary to the purpose sought to be effectuated
by the patent law. Reply Br. 7-8 (citing
In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543 (CCPA 1973)
(quotations omitted)).
In Wiggins, the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals stated:
*1337 In our view, [the alleged anticipatory reference's]
listing of the compounds by name constituted
nothing more than speculation about their
potential or theoretical existence. The mere naming
of a compound in a reference, without more,
cannot constitute a description of the compound,
particularly when, as in this case, the evidence of
record suggests that a method suitable for its
preparation was not developed until a date later
than that of the reference.
If we were to hold otherwise, lists of thousands
of theoretically possible compounds could be
generated and published which, assuming it
would be within the level of skill in the art to
make them, would bar a patent to the actual dis

[11] Gleave reads Wiggins to suggest that a description
of a compound cannot be anticipatory
where it appears in a long list of other compounds.
That conclusion, however, ignores the facts at issue
in that case. Contrary to Gleave's representations,
no evidence existed that a person of ordinary skill
in the art could make the compounds disclosed in
the alleged anticipatory reference at the time of disclosure.
The reference, published in 1957, mentioned
by name two compounds that fell within the
scope of Wiggins's claims. But the reference also
noted that the synthesis of these compounds had
been unsuccessful; further, the only publication of
record that disclosed a method of making the compounds
was not published until two years later. In
short, the reference was not an enabling reference-
no person of ordinary skill in the art could make the
FN3
claimed invention in 1957.
FN3. It is true that [e]nablement of an anticipatory
reference may be demonstrated
by a later reference. Bristol-Myers
Squibb, 246 F.3d at 1379. But in Wiggins,
our predecessor court did not elect to decide
the case on this ground. 488 F.2d at
543 n. 4 (We do not mean to suggest that
we have actually evaluated the process
taught by [the later reference] and concluded
that it could be used to prepare the
claimed compounds. As this is irrelevant to
our decision, we express no opinion on this
point.).
[12] The Wiggins court stated that [t]he mere
naming of a compound in a reference, without
more, cannot constitute a description of the compound.
488 F.2d at 543. We agree. The mere naming
of a theoretical compound, without more, cannot
constitute a description under  102(b).
Without more is the key phrase, and read as a
whole Wiggins makes clear just what this
something more is-a person of ordinary skill in
the art's ability to make the claimed compound. See
also Donohue, 766 F.2d at 533-34; In re Samour,
571 F.2d 559, 562-64 (CCPA 1978); In re Brown,
51 C.C.P.A. 1254, 329 F.2d 1006, 1009-10 (1964)
(discussing In re Von Bramer, 29 C.C.P.A. 1018,
127 F.2d 149 (1942)). This point is underscored by
the excerpt: not once, not twice, but three times the
court pointed out that its discussion was in the context
of potential or theoretical compounds. That
was the issue presented to the court, and that was
the issue it decided.
[13] For the purposes of whether they are anticipatory,
lists and genera are often treated differently
under our case law. Compare Perricone v.
Medicis Pharm. Corp., 432 F.3d 1368, 1376
(Fed.Cir.2005) (rejecting the notion that [a compound]
cannot anticipate because it appears without
special emphasis in a longer list) with Atofina v.
Great Lakes Chem. Corp., 441 F.3d 991, 999
(Fed.Cir.2006) (It is well established that the disclosure
of a genus in the prior art is not necessarily
a disclosure of every species that is a member of
that genus.). This distinction collapses *1338
when the class of compounds that falls within the
genus is so limited that a person of ordinary skill in
the art can at once envisage each member of this
limited class. Eli Lilly, 471 F.3d at 1376. In that
limited circumstance, a reference describing the
genus anticipates every species within the genus.
See Perricone, 432 F.3d at 1377. In this case,
Gleave's arguments fail for two reasons. First,
Wraight expressly lists every possible fifteen-
base-long oligodeoxynucleotide sequence in IGFBP-
2, and under our precedent, this list anticipates
Gleave's claims. Second, even if we were to accept
Gleave's invitation to treat Wraight as equivalent to
the statement that one could make antisense that
FN4
targets IGFBP-2, which we decline to do, a
person of ordinary skill in the art equipped with an
IGFBP sequence is admittedly capable of envisioning
how to make any antisense sequence. Thus,
even if we were to adopt Gleave's policy position,
Gleave's claims would not be entitled to a patent

over Wraight.
FN4. We note that this is not the full extent
of Wraight's disclosure. See supra
[14] The rest of Gleave's arguments fare no
better. For instance, Gleave protests that Wraight
does not show that sequences antisense to any of
the sequences in this list were actually made and
tested. As we have already made clear, it is not
necessary that an invention disclosed in a publication
shall have actually been made in order to satisfy
the enablement requirement. Donohue, 766
F.2d at 533. In light of the foregoing, we agree with
the Board's conclusion that Gleave's claims are invalid
as anticipated by Wraight.
CONCLUSION
In sum, [t]he discovery of a new property or
use of a previously known composition, even when
that property and use are unobvious from the prior
art, can not impart patentability to claims to the
known composition. In re Spada, 911 F.2d 705,
708 (Fed.Cir.1990). The compositions described in
the ' 493 application are simply not new-they were
described in Wraight's enabling disclosure. As we
explained in In re Schoenwald, Gleave's contribution,
at best, is finding a use for the compound, not
discovering the compound itself. 964 F.2d 1122,
1124 (Fed.Cir.1992). If the use Gleave discovered
is new, he will be able to patent that method of use
any more would be a gratuity. Id. Therefore, we
affirm the Board's rejection of claims 1, 4, 15, and
18-21 of the '493 application under  102(b). We
need not reach the  103 obviousness rejection.
