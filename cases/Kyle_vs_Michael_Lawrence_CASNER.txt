Donald Kyle, and Robert Kupper's (Chapman's)
U.S. Patent Application No. 11/391,897 (the '897
application) and Michael Casner, Jen-Sen Dung,
Erno Keskeny, and Jin Luo's (Casner's) U.S. Patent
No. 7,153,966 (the '966 patent) both claim
methods of preparing oxycodone that reduce the
levels of a potentially toxic intermediate,
14-hydroxycodeinone. In Interference No. 105,553,
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (the
Board) granted Casner's motion seeking judgment
that Chapman claims 96-118 were unpatentable under
35 U.S.C.  103(a). Chapman appeals, asking
us to hold claims 96-118 of the '897 application
nonobvious. Casner maintains that those claims
were obvious, but has also lodged a cross-appeal,
arguing that if we reverse the Board's holdings as to
the '897 application, we should reverse its holdings
on the '966 patent and remand for a priority determination.
For the reasons set forth below, we affirm
the Board's obviousness determination.
I. BACKGROUND
The '897 application is entitled Process for
Preparing Oxycodone Hydrochloride Having Less
Than 25 ppm 14-Hydroxycodeinone. The only independent
claim at issue is claim 96, which recites:
A process for preparing oxycodone or an oxycodone
salt, which process comprises steps of:
(a) preparing a mixture of oxycodone, solvent
and an acid;
(b) incubating the mixture under conditions suitable
to promote reaction of 8, 14-dihydroxy-7,
8-dihydrocodeinone to 14-hydroxycodeinone;
and subsequently
(c) exposing the mixture to hydrogenation reagents
under conditions sufficient for conversion
of 14-hydroxycodeinone to oxycodone.
J.A. 77 (emphases added).
Oxycodone is a synthetic analgesic opioid used
to relieve pain. Typically, one prepares oxycodone
by first oxidizing thebaine. This step converts
thebaine into two types of compounds:
14-hydroxycodeinone (14-hydroxy) and the 8,
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinones (collectively,
8, 14-dihydroxys). The 14-hydroxy is converted
via hydrogenation into oxycodone, which is then
treated with acid during a final salting step to
yield pharmaceutical grade oxycodone. Any
14-hydroxy remaining at the end of the reaction is
problematic, as the compound is potentially toxic.
The 8, 14-dihydroxys created during the initial
oxidation step are stereoisomers-*296 there are two
forms, designated 8 and an 8, that differ only
by the relative orientation of a hydroxyl group.
Chapman claims that prior to the '897 application,
persons of ordinary skill in the art did not know that
8 formed during the reaction. Instead, they believed
that thebaine oxidized to form 14-hydroxy
and 8, and that any 14-hydroxy remaining at the
end of the reaction was leftover, unreacted
14-hydroxy. In fact, during the salting step at least
one of the 8, 14-dihydroxys reacts with acid to form
new 14-hydroxy; this 14-hydroxy can then, of
course, undergo hydrogenation to become additional
oxycodone.
**2 Chapman argues that he was the first to recognize
that additional 14-hydroxy is created from
8 during the reaction's salting step, and that the
new 14-hydroxy can therefore yield additional
oxycodone. Chapman purports to claim this method
of eliminating the new 14-hydroxy in claim 96.
The claim does not, however, differentiate between
the 8 and 8 forms of 8, 14-dihydroxy, nor does
the claim language specifically disclose which conditions
are suitable for promoting the desired reaction
from 8, 14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy.
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.
1295(a)(4)(A).
II. DISCUSSION
Obviousness is a legal conclusion based on underlying
findings of fact. In re DBC, 545 F.3d
1373, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2008). We review the Board's
ultimate determination of obviousness de novo,

(Not Selected for publication in the Federal Reporter)
(Cite as: 315 Fed.Appx. 294, 2009 WL 606065 (C.A.Fed.))
while we review the Board's underlying factual
findings for substantial evidence. Id.
We first turn to Chapman's arguments. Chapman
claims that prior to the '897 application, no one
knew that 8 was formed during thebaine oxidation.
Nor, according to Chapman, was it known that 8
could react with acid under certain commercial
conditions to form additional 14-hydroxy. Chapman
admits that the prior art disclosed 8, but
claims that under commercial oxycodone production
conditions, 8 converts into a benign salt, not
into 14-hydroxy. In his view, the prior art would
lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to believe
that 8 must be treated with stronger than commercially
used amounts of hydrochloric acid before
it converts to 14-hydroxy.
Casner states that Chapman never claimed 8
as crucial to the invention before the Board; in other
words, Chapman never tried to distinguish the
prior art based on stereochemistry. Casner likewise
argues that Chapman waived any commercial conditions
limitation. Chapman responds that both issues
were raised, although the stereochemistry argument
is emphasized on appeal because Casner
did not produce the Proksa reference (upon which
the Board relied) until its response, leaving Chapman
little opportunity to analyze and respond to the
specific issues raised by that reference. Chapman
also argues that since the Board identified a
commercial need for reduced levels of
14-hydroxy, and found that a person of skill in the
art would work in the highly competitive pharmaceutical
industry, the Board understood that commercial
conditions were at issue.
Chapman does not direct us to specific arguments
in submissions to the Board where counsel
pursued the claim that commercial conditions were
necessary; nor has Chapman clarified which conditions
would qualify as commercial conditions.
Similarly, although 8 is identified in some of the
'897 application's figures, and Chapman's expert
made references to stereoisomers in reviewing the
prior art, Chapman has not identified any statement
before the Board that explicitly differentiated*297
between the invention and the prior art based on
stereochemistry.
**3 Regardless, we need not resolve the waiver
issue definitively. Chapman maintains, and we
agree, that [t]he term 8, 14-dihydroxy properly
includes 8, but there is no reason for that term to
be limited to that isomer in Chapman's claims. The
term conditions' properly includes commercial
conditions, but there is no reason to limit that term
to commercial conditions in Chapman's claims.
Appellant's Reply Br. 27. Further, the '897 application
states: The term 8, 14-dihydroxy-7,
8-dihydrocodeinone includes either 8,
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinone; or 8,
14-dihydroxy-7, 8-dihydrocodeinone or can include
a mixture of both compounds. '897 application
0043.
Thus, claim 96 merely requires one to incubate
the mixture under conditions suitable to promote
reaction of 8, 14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy. Therefore,
prior art references that disclose either the 8
or 8 form of 8, 14-dihydroxy converting to
14-hydroxy, or disclose any reaction condition
(whether commercial or not) that promotes the
conversion of 8 or 8 to 14-hydroxy, may render
the claim obvious. See In re May, 574 F.2d 1082,
1088-89 (C.C.P.A.1978) ([The reference] expressly
discloses ... a species within the genus of
claim 1. Therefore, [the reference] is a technical anticipation
of claim 1. Appellants' assertions to the
contrary notwithstanding, this finding does not constitute
a new ground of rejection; lack of novelty is
the epitome of obviousness.); cf. Medichem, S.A.
v. Rolabo, S.L., 353 F.3d 928, 934-35
(Fed.Cir.2003) (concluding that first step of an interference-
in-fact inquiry was satisfied where two
method claims had a genus/species relationship,
since  [i]t is ... an elementary principle of patent
law that when, as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise,
a claim covers several compositions, the
claim is anticipated if one of them is in the prior
art. ) (quoting Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner,
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 971

double patenting analysis, noting that [t]he only
other difference between [the two method claims] is
that the former is directed to humans while the latter
is directed to animals, and [o]ur case law
firmly establishes that a later genus claim limitation
is anticipated by, and therefore not patentably distinct
from, an earlier species claim.).
The Board found that the prior art discloses
methods under which at least one 8, 14-dihydroxy
reacts to yield 14-hydroxy under certain conditions.
Specifically, the Board noted that the FDA
recognized that there was a need to eliminate impurities
in oxycodone, and then proceeded to walk
through the prior art, which disclosed: that both
14-hydroxy and 8, 14-dihydroxy were known impurities
during the thebaine oxidation reaction; that
treatment of 8, 14-dihydroxy with hydrochloric acid
converts 8, 14-dihydroxy into 14-hydroxy under
certain reaction conditions; that one of skill in the
art would be able to identify those conditions; and
that 14-hydroxy may be removed from oxycodone
via hydrogenation.
**4 As mentioned, claim 96 would have been
obvious if properly-combinable references disclosed
conditions suitable to promote reaction of 8,
14-dihydroxy to 14-hydroxy. The prior art references
here do just that: they indicate that 8, at
least, will under certain reaction conditions form
14-hydroxy. Given that claims directed to the genus
(methods for eliminating 8, 14-dihydroxys) can be
anticipated or rendered obvious by references disclosing
the species (methods for eliminating either
the 8 *298 or 8 form of 8, 14-dihydroxy), we
agree with the Board that the method described in
claim 96 would have been obvious. As a result, we
need not address Casner's cross appeal.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons detailed above, we affirm the
Board's decision to reject claims 96-118 of the '897
application under 35 U.S.C.  103(a).
RADER, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
The Food and Drug Administration seeks the
removal of impurities such as 14-hydroxy from the
pain medicine oxycodone salt. During research on
oxycodone, Chapman discovered that oxidation of
thebaine creates the stereoisomer 8, which in turn
creates additional 14-hydroxy during formulation of
this important pharmaceutical. Until this discovery,
this field of art believed that the original oxidation
step created the additional 14-hydroxy impurity.
After discovering 8, Chapman learned to isolate
and hydrogenate the additional 14-hydroxy to eliminate
most of these impurities. Chapman, thus, was
the first person to identify the true nature of the
leftover 14-hydroxy problem and the first to
solve it. Because this important and innovative
solution deserves a patent over the prior art, I
would reverse the Board.
Chapman's invention calls to mind the Supreme
Court's resolution of Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota
& Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45, 43 S.Ct.
322, 67 L.Ed. 523 (1923). In Eibel, the primary distinction
of the invention over the prior art was discovery
of the problem in that discipline. Id. at
67-68, 43 S.Ct. 322. Eibel discovered that unequal
speeds of stock and wire produced a defective paper
product under high machine speeds. Id. The
variance in paper speed created disturbances and
ripples some ten feet from the discharge. Id. With
the problem defined, Eibel easily prescribed the
solution by elevating one end of the paper feed to
equalize the speeds of the wire and the paper stock
by gravity. Id. at 64, 43 S.Ct. 322.
In this case, Chapman discovered that the salting
of stereoisomer 8, not the oxidation of
thebaine, created the additional 14-hydroxy impurity
in oxycodone salt. He solved this problem by
isolating and hydrogenating the 14-hydroxy to form
additional oxycodone. Chapman's invention was not
the mere use of a known technique to remedy a
known source of trouble, but was, as Chief Justice
Taft stated, the discovery of the source not before
known and the application of the remedy for
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

which he seeks reward of the grant of a patent. Id.
at 68, 43 S.Ct. 322.
**5 Similarly, in In re Conover, Conover discovered
a solution to the problem of connecting a
rod to an outboard motor engine containing compact,
anti-friction roller bearings. 49 C.C.P.A.
1205, 304 F.2d 680, 681 (1962). A phenomenon
known as galling could destroy the bearings at
unpredictable times by heating of the roller elements.
Id. at 681-82. To overcome this galling,
Conover put a non-galling material, such as silver,
on the end faces of the connecting rod bearings. Id.
at 682. Citing the rationale of Eibel, the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA) found that
the differences between Conover's patent application
and the prior art were such that the subject
matter as a whole, i.e., (a) the discovery of the
cause of the bearing failures and (b) its elimination
by the claimed plating of ... the contacting
areas of the face portions of the connecting rods
and the crank cheeks, were not obvious from the
prior art at the time the invention was made to a
person having ordinary skill in this art. Id. at 684.
*299 In In re Sponnoble, the pharmaceutical
industry faced the problem of unwanted moisture
leakage between liquid and solid compartments in
vials. 56 C.C.P.A. 823, 405 F.2d 578, 586 (1969).
Sponnoble discovered that the cause of this leakage
was the passage of moisture through, rather than
around, the center plug of the vial. Id. He solved
the problem by fabricating a center seal plug of
butyl rubber with a silicone coating. Id. The CCPA
found, a patentable invention may lie in the discovery
of the source of a problem even though the
remedy may be obvious once the source of the
problem is identified. This is part of the subject
matter as a whole which should always be considered
in determining the obviousness of an invention
under 35 USC 103. Id. at 585. In resolving the
issue of obviousness, the court stated, The crux of
the matter ... is the discovery by appellant that passage
through the center plug was a major cause of
moisture transmission. Id. at 586. The court
reasoned that [t]he question here is whether the
prior art recognized the cause of the problem,
which it did not. Id.
The CCPA in In re Peehs found that Peehs had
represented to the Patent and Trademark Office that
up until the time of the claimed invention, the nuclear
[power] industry faced the problem of undesirable
stressing of fuel rod claddings in gas-cooled
nuclear reactors. 612 F.2d 1287, 1290
(C.C.P.A.1980). Peehs discovered that the cause
of this stressing was sticking between the metal surfaces
of the claddings and the contact elements of
the spacer grids. Id. He solved this problem by
roughening one of the contact surfaces. Id. Thus,
as in Eibel, Conover, and Sponnoble, the crux of
the matter is the discovery by appellants of the
cause of a problem, and the determinative question
is whether that cause would have been recognized
by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention
was made. Id.
**6 In reversing the Board's holding of obviousness,
the CCPA found no support for the conclusion
that those of ordinary skill in the art would
have recognized that sticking between the fuel rod
claddings and the spacer grid contact elements
caused the stressing of the claddings. Id. The court
also found that  [where] there is no evidence of
record that a person of ordinary skill in the art at
the time of [an applicant's] invention would have
expected [a problem], e.g., sticking, to exist at all,
it is not proper to conclude that [an invention],
e.g., roughening one of the contact surfaces, which
solves this problem, ... would have been obvious to
that hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art.
Id. (citing In re Nomiya, 509 F.2d 566, 572
(C.C.P.A.1975)).
The Supreme Court in KSR International Co. v.
Teleflex Inc. recently held that [w]hen there is a
design need or market pressure to solve a problem
and there are a finite number of identified, predictable
solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good
reason to pursue the known options within his or
her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated

success, it is likely the product not of innovation
but of ordinary skill and common sense. 550 U.S.
398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 1742, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007).
This case, as are Eibel, Conover, Sponnoble, and
Peehs, is distinguished from KSR because there
were no finite number of identified, predictable
solutions that were used to discover the source of
and solution to the problems. Id. No persons of ordinary
skill in the art knew of the existence of 8
before Chapman and, in fact, were trying to solve
the problem of removing excess 14-hydroxy impurities
from oxycodone salt by other means. Because
no other persons had discovered and solved this
problem as *300 Chapman did, his invention is the
product of innovation and not of ordinary skill and
common sense. Id.
Following KSR, this court in 2008 in Ortho-
McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Mylan Laboratories,
Inc., found an invention worthy of a patent
when a researcher in his search for a new antidiabetic
drug, accidentally discovered topiramate. 520
F.3d 1358 (Fed.Cir.2008). Topiramate is a reaction
intermediate that has powerful anticonvulsant properties
marketed by Ortho-McNeil as TOPOMAX
for the treatment of epilepsy. Id. at 1360. This court
attached particular importance to the objective criteria
of nonobviousness, including the powerful,
unexpected results of topiramate (i.e., anticonvulsive
activity), skepticism of experts, copying, and
commercial success. Id. at 1365. As this court has
repeatedly explained, this evidence is not just a cumulative
or confirmatory part of the obviousness
calculus but constitutes independent evidence of
nonobviousness. Id. (citing Catalina Lighting, Inc.
v. Lamps Plus, Inc., 295 F.3d 1277, 1288
(Fed.Cir.2002) (Objective indicia may often be the
most probative and cogent evidence of nonobviousness
in the record.)).
**7 Chapman unexpectedly discovered that the
stereoisomer 8, when salted, creates additional
14-hydroxy. This additional 14-hydroxy can be
isolated and hydrogenated to create additional oxycodone,
containing much less of the 14-hydroxy
impurities that the FDA desired removed from oxycodone
salt. Persons of ordinary skill in the art never
discovered or appreciated the presence of 8 as
the source of the additional 14-hydroxy. The prior
art disclosed that 14-hydroxy was a carry-over from
the oxidation of thebaine, resulting in leftover, unreacted
14-hydroxy in the oxycodone salt. [T]he
challenges of this inventive process would have
prevented one of ordinary skill in this art from traversing
the multiple obstacles to easily produce the
invention in light of the evidence available at the
time of invention. Ortho-McNeil, 520 F.3d at
1365. Chapman, therefore, unexpectedly discovered
the true source of the additional 14-hydroxy and
solved the problem by removing the impurity from
oxycodone salt. Because the prior art could not
have intended or appreciated Chapman's discovery
or solution, this invention deserves patent protection.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
