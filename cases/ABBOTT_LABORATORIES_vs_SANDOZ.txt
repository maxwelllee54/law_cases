Federal Circuit.
ABBOTT LABORATORIES, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
SANDOZ, INC., Defendant-Appellant.
No. 2007-1300.
Oct. 21, 2008.
Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Feb. 23,
FN*
2009.
FN* Circuit Judge Schall did not participate in
the vote.
Background: Patent owner brought action against competitor
alleging infringement of its patents relating to
extended release formulations of clarithromycin. The
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, David H. Coar, J., 500 F.Supp.2d 807, granted
owner's motion for preliminary injunction, and denied
competitor's motion for stay of injunction pending appeal,
500 F.Supp.2d 846. Competitor appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) finding of inequitable conduct was not appropriate;
(2) patent owner had substantial likelihood of success
on merits of claim that its patents were not likely to be
held unenforceable based on inequitable conduct;
(3) owner had substantial likelihood of success on merits
of claim that its patents were infringed;
(4) owner would likely suffer irreparable harm by market
share and revenue loss upon competitor's entry into
the market in absence of preliminary injunction;
(5) balance of hardships favored preliminary injunction;
and
(6) public interest supported grant of preliminary injunction.
Affirmed.
Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.

F.Supp.2d 807 (N.D.Ill.2007) (grant of preliminary
injunction); 500 F.Supp.2d 846
(N.D.Ill.2007) (denial of stay pending appeal);
529 F.Supp.2d 893 (N.D.Ill.2007) (grant and
denial of various motions for summary judgment).
BACKGROUND
This suit concerns two Abbott Laboratories patents
on extended release formulations of the antibiotic drug
clarithromycin, sold by Abbott with the brand name Biaxin
XL. The patent on clarithromycin itself expired in
2005; only extended release formulations are at issue.
The purpose of the extended release formulation is to
extend the period of drug effectiveness after ingestion
and thereby to reduce the requisite frequency of dosage.
Sandoz filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application
(ANDA) for its extended release formulation of clarithromycin;
the Food and Drug Administration approved
the ANDA on August 25, 2005, and on September 16,
2005 Abbott filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charging San-
doz with infringement of United States Patent No.
6,010,718 (the '718 patent) and Patent No. 6,551,616
(the '616 patent). Abbott also charged infringement
*1344 of Patent No. 6,872,407, but has withdrawn this
patent from suit.
The '718 patent claims an extended release pharmaceutical
composition comprising an erythromycin
derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer,
whereby after ingestion certain specified parameters of
drug bioavailability are met. Claims 1, 4, and 6 of the '
718 patent are in suit:
1. A pharmaceutical composition for extended release
of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal
environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative
and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer, so that when ingested
orally, the composition induces statistically significantly
lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma
than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin
derivative while maintaining bioavailability
substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release
composition of the erythromycin derivative.
4. A pharmaceutical composition for extended release
of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal
environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative
and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer, so that upon oral ingestion,
maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin
derivative are lower than those produced by an
immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and
area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum
plasma concentrations are substantially equivalent
to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical
composition.

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
6. An extended release pharmaceutical composition
comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer, the composition having
an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate
release formulation.
The '616 patent is a continuation-in-part of the '718
patent, with claims directed to the method of reducing
gastrointestinal side effects. Claim 2 is in suit, shown
with claim 1 from which it depends:
1. A method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side
effects comprising administering an effective amount
of extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising
an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the
erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin.
In response to the charge of infringement Sandoz
presented the defenses of invalidity based on anticipation
and obviousness, unenforceability based on inequitable
conduct, and noninfringement. This appeal is from
the district court's grant of Abbott's motion for a preliminary
injunction, preserving the status quo during the
pendency of this litigation. Sandoz challenges the district
court's rulings on all issues.
I
VALIDITY ISSUES
The district court reviewed the factors relevant to
the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, viz., (1)
likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation,
(2) whether irreparable harm is likely if the injunction
is not granted, (3) the balance of hardships as
between the litigants, and (4) factors of the public interest.
See Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int'l, 316 F.3d
1331, 1338-39 (Fed.Cir.2003); H.H. Robertson Co. v.
United Steel Deck, Inc., 820 F.2d 384, 387-88
(Fed.Cir.1987). At the stage of the preliminary injunction,
before the issues of fact and law have been fully
explored and finally resolved, [t]he *1345 purpose of a
preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative
positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be
held. University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390,
395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981).
On appellate review of the grant of a preliminary
injunction, the question is simply whether the issuance
of the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion.
Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 932, 95 S.Ct. 2561,
45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975). It is well settled that the granting
of a temporary injunction, pending final hearing, is
within the sound discretion of the trial court; and that,
upon appeal, an order granting such an injunction will
not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity,
or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion.
Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U.S.
282, 290, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940). Abuse of
discretion is established by showing that the court
made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant
factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of
law or clearly erroneous factual findings. Novo Nordisk
of North America, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 77 F.3d
1364, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1996). See Cybor Corp. v. FAS
Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1460 (Fed.Cir.1998)
(en banc ) (A district court abuses its discretion when
its decision is based on clearly erroneous findings of
fact, is based on erroneous interpretations of the law, or
is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or fanciful.).
Sandoz assigns legal error to the district court's rulings
that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of
validity, infringement, and inequitable conduct, and
states that the district court abused its discretion in balancing
the equities and granting the injunction.
Anticipation
Anticipation in patent usage means that the
claimed invention was previously known and described
in a printed publication, explicitly or inherently. Anticipation
is established by documentary evidence, and
requires that every claim element and limitation is set
forth in a single prior art reference, in the same form
and order as in the claim. See In re Omeprazole Patent
Litigation, 483 F.3d 1364, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2007); Continental
Can Co. v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264, 1267
(Fed.Cir.1991). An anticipating reference must enable
that which it is asserted to anticipate. Omeprazole, 483
F.3d at 1378 (To anticipate, the identical subject matter
must not only be previously known, but the knowledge
must be sufficiently enabling to place the inform

ation in the possession of the public.); Elan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. v. Mayo Found. for Medical Educ. & Research,
346 F.3d 1051, 1054 (Fed.Cir.2003) (same).
Sandoz argued that the '718 patent is anticipated by
European Patent Publication No. 0,280,571 B1 (the '571
Publication), which describes a sustained release matrix
formulation in tablet form comprising from 0.1% by
weight to 90% by weight of an antimicrobial agent selected
from ... erythromycin ... from 5% by weight to
29% by weight of a hydrophilic polymer, and from
0.5% by weight to 25% by weight of an acrylic polymer....
The '571 Publication states that hydrophilic
polymers such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose
(HPMC) can be used to form a hydrophilic matrix
which respond[s] to increases in pH with a corresponding
increase in the permeability of the dosage form.
Sandoz argued in the district court that although the
'571 Publication does not mention clarithromycin or the
specific pharmacokinetic limitations in the '718 patent
claims, the '571 Publication anticipates the '718 claims
because clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative
and the claimed pharmacokinetic limitations are inherent
in the extended release compositions of the '571
Publication. Sandoz also argued that enablement *1346
of the compositions in the '571 Publication must be presumed,
because the compositions in the '718 patent are
presumed to be enabled and, according to Sandoz, are
identical.
Abbott responded that the '571 Publication cannot
anticipate because it does not show the elements of
the claims of issue; it does not mention clarithromycin,
it does not disclose the pharmacokinetic criteria stated
in the '718 claims, and it does not enable these limitations,
either expressly or inherently. Abbott argued that
significant experimentation would be required to ascertain
the applicability of any release agent from the large
number of release agents mentioned in the '571 Publication,
particularly as applied to a different biological
product having different dissolution and metabolic characteristics.
Thus Abbott argued that the legal criteria of
anticipation are not met by the '571 Publication.
The district court found that Sandoz did not present
evidence sufficient to support its argument that the
'571 Publication's teachings would enable Abbott to create
an extended release of an erythromycin derivative
drug simply based on the structural limitations. Abbott,
500 F.Supp.2d at 840. The district court observed that
the '571 Publication does not offer any in vivo dissolution
data nor state the pharmacokinetic profile of its
own formulations. Id. The court concluded that Sandoz
would not be likely to succeed in establishing anticipation
by this reference. We discern no clear error in this
conclusion, for the '571 Publication neither describes
the product of the '718 claims nor enables the pharmacokinetic
properties that are set forth in the '718 claims.
See Elan Pharmaceuticals, 346 F.3d at 1057 (an anticipating
reference must disclose every element of the
claims, and place a person of ordinary skill in possession
of the claimed invention).
Obviousness
Sandoz also argued that the claims of the '781 and '
616 patents are invalid on the ground of obviousness, in
view of the combination of the '571 Publication with
PCT Application WO 95/30422 (the PCT or '422 Application)
and United States Patent No. 5,705,190 (the
'190 patent).
In determining, for preliminary injunction purposes,
the likelihood that patent invalidity would be established
at trial, the district court evaluates the factual and
legal arguments in light of the presumptions and burdens
that will inhere at trial, viz., that [a] patent shall
be presumed valid.... The burden of establishing invalidity
of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the
party asserting such invalidity. 35 U.S.C.  282. This
burden exists at every stage of the litigation. Canon
Computer Systems, Inc. v. Nu-Kote Int'l, Inc., 134 F.3d
1085, 1088 (Fed.Cir.1998); see Sanofi-Synthelabo v.
Apotex, Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006)
(taking into account the applicable presumptions and
burdens in reviewing the grant of a preliminary injunction).
Sandoz on this appeal relies on the Supreme
Court's decision in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex,
Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705
(2007), Sandoz arguing that the law of obviousness has
been significantly changed, and that the district court
did not give adequate recognition to the changed law.

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161
(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
The district court had issued its initial decision granting
the preliminary injunction shortly before the Court's decision
in KSR. The court then requested supplemental
briefing and argument, and issued a further opinion discussing
the issues in light of KSR and continuing to
conclude that Abbott was likely to prevail on the merits
of the question of obviousness.
In its initial decision the district court discussed the
references in detail. The *1347 court explained that the
PCT Application, entitled Controlled-Release Dosage
Forms of Azithromycin, describes [a] dosage form for
oral administration comprising azithromycin and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, which releases not
more than about 10% of its incorporated azithromycin
into a mammal's stomach, and which releases not more
than an additional 10% during the first 15 minutes after
entering said mammal's duodenum, and exhibits decreased
gastrointestinal side effects. The district court
explained that the PCT Application shows hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
(HPMC) and other polymers as a
hydrophilic polymer sufficient to provide a useful degree
of control over the azithromycin dissolution, and
contains in vitro data showing the amount and timing of
dissolution of azithromycin in various conditions and
sustained dosage forms.
Sandoz argued that these teachings should be combined
with those of the '571 Publication and the '190
patent entitled Controlled Release Formulation for
Poorly Soluble Basic Drugs, which describes a
controlled release solid pharmaceutical composition
adapted for oral administration comprising: a therapeutically
effective amount of at least one basic drug having
a water solubility of less than 1 part per 30 parts water
... wherein the basic drug is a macrolide and as the release
agent a water-soluble alginate salt. The '190 patent
names the macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin,
azithromycin, roxithromycin, and ABT229
for use with the alginate salt release agent. Sandoz
argued that the subject matter of the '718 patent would
have been obvious in view of the ' 571 Publication
showing extended release formulations of erythromycin
derivatives, in combination with the controlled release
formulations and pharmacokinetic properties of azith
romycin in the PCT Application, and the modified release
alginate salt formulation of clarithromycin in the '
190 patent. Sandoz argued that a person of ordinary
skill in this field would have desired to improve the administration
of clarithromycin by finding an extended
release formulation having optimum release and biological
properties, and would have selected and tested the
HPMC from the '571 Publication, in view of the formulation
of azithromycin with HPMC in the PCT Application
and the '190 patent's use of an alginate salt to modify
the release of clarithromycin. Sandoz stressed that
the PCT Application states the known principle of using
controlled release formulations to reduce the dosing frequency
for short half-life compounds. Sandoz argued
that no more than routine experimentation was needed
to find a controlled release formulation that would meet
the pharmacokinetic requirements stated in the '718
claims.
Sandoz applied similar arguments to the claims of
the '616 patent, stating that the PCT Application teaches
that control of azithromycin release reduces
gastrointestinal side effects, and that the '190 patent
shows the interchangeability of azithromycin and clarithromycin
in the formulation using an alginate salt. San-
doz argued that this combination of references renders
obvious a clarithromycin formulation with reduced
gastrointestinal side effects as claimed in the '616 patent
. In its supplemental argument based on KSR, Sandoz
argued that Abbott merely pursue[d] known options
for both the '718 and '616 patents, based on the Court's
exposition that: When there is a design need or market
pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number
of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary
skill has good reason to pursue the known options
within his or her technical grasp. KSR, 127 S.Ct.
at 1742.
In the district court Abbott disputed the premises
presented by Sandoz, challenged *1348 the analysis of
the content and significance of the references, and argued
that KSR did not hold, as Sandoz proposed, that
the recognition of a problem of itself renders the solution
obvious. Abbott argued that more is needed than recognizing
the problem, as this court discussed in Cardi

1371, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2004) (Recognition of a need does
not render obvious the achievement that meets that

the Court qualified its discussion by explaining that the
problem should have a finite number of identified,
predictable solutions, KSR, 127 S.Ct. at 1742, to expose
its eventual solution to unpatentability as obvious
to try. Id. Abbott stressed the difference between new
biological compositions whose performance and effectiveness
in combination cannot be confidently predicted
but must be made and evaluated, and new mechanical
combinations of known elements each of which predictably
performs its known function in the combination.
Abbott stressed that its choice of extended release components
is not shown or suggested by the prior art to
produce the pharmacokinetic properties of Abbott's
claims. The Court recognized in Dennison Mfg. Co. v.
Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 106 S.Ct. 1578, 89
L.Ed.2d 817 (1986) that the district court is not to rely
on hindsight, and that in addressing the question of obviousness
a judge must not pick and choose isolated elements
from the prior art and combine them so as to
yield the invention in question if such a combination
would not have been obvious at the time of the invention.
475 U.S. at 810, 106 S.Ct. 1578. In Graham v.
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d
545 (1966) the Court recognized that the obviousness
inquiry must guard against slipping into use of hindsight
and to resist the temptation to read into the prior
art the teachings of the invention in issue. Id. at 36, 86
S.Ct. 684.
Abbott agreed that the basic principles of pharmacokinetics
were known, but argued that the limitations in the
'718 claims, whereby the bioavailability of the product
was characterized, were not shown as achieved in any
reference or any combination of references. Abbott
pointed out that the PCT Application is directed specifically
to azithromycin and shows scores of possible
formulations, all using in vitro data, and does not contemplate
metabolite activity in vivo as is manifested for
chlorithromycin. Abbott stated that the '422 publication
discloses more than a dozen possible classes of delivery
devices, Abbott Brief at 42, that the '422 publication
merely provides in vitro dissolution data for a
subset of its disclosed compositions, and that the formulation
in the PCT Application did not even have
equivalent bioavailability as IR [immediate release] azithromycin.
Id. at 41, 86 S.Ct. 684.
Abbott described in the '718 and '616 specifications that
the '190 patent reference presents C values [that]
max
are not statistically significantly different from those of
the IR formulation. '718 patent, col. 2, lines 11-12; '
616 patent, col. 2, lines 13-14 (referring to Ser. No.
08/574,877, the '190 patent). Abbott stated that Sandoz
concedes that the '190 patent does not describe pharmacokinetic
limitations based on clarithromycin
plasma concentrations, and that neither the PCT Application
nor the '190 patent discloses the pharmacokinetic
limitations and properties set forth in the '718 and
'616 claims, and that neither the PCT Application nor
any other reference provides guidance as to which formulation
would provide the pharmacokinetic characteristics
required by the '718 claims.
Thus Abbott argued in the district court that a skilled artisan
would not have known the effect of substituting
*1349clarithromycin for azithromycin in any specific
formulation that might be selected from the PCT Application,
for it is undisputed that there are significant
differences among erythromycin derivatives. Abbott
presented evidence to the district court that azithromycin
and clarithromycin exhibit different properties in
four biological processes of relevance to oral drug administration:
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
excretion. These differences were tabulated by Abbott's
expert, Professor Stanley S. Davis, as follows:

Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Davis, February 7,
2007. The parties do not dispute that the PCT Application
describes only in vitro data, and that in vitro data
are not predictably transferable to in vivo conditions.
Dr. Davis testified that it simply isn't the case that in
vitro controlled release data will automatically correlate
with the pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo, and in
fact, for many of the formulations of the '422 application,
they affirmatively do not so correlate. Id.
The district court concluded that a person of ordinary
skill in this field would not have predicted which
formulation, that might be selected from the prior art,
would provide the required pharmacokinetics. The district
court referred to the dissimilarities in the pharmacokinetic
properties for azithromycin as shown in the
PCT Application, considered the content of the ' 190
patent, and concluded that the bioavailability of the formulations
claimed in the '718 patent were not predictable
from these references. The court referred to the
testimony of another Abbott expert, Dr. Daniel Weiner,
that the '190 patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-
specific PK [ pharmacokinetic] data or any DFL
FN2
[degree of fluctuation] values at all. Declaration
of Daniel Weiner, Ph.D., January 9, 2007. Dr. Weiner
explained that the pK values reported in the '190 patent
are based on total antibiotic activity, which consists of
the combined concentrations of clarithromycin and its
active metabolite, while the pharmacokinetic elements
of the '718 patent relate specifically to clarithromycin
plasma concentrations. Dr. Weiner concluded, and the
district court agreed, that a skilled artisan would not
have had a reasonable expectation of producing effective
compositions based on the mention of clarithromy
cin along with azithromycin in the '190 patent, because
of their different mechanisms of antibiotic activity and
the effect of this activity on pharmacokinetic behavior.
FN2. The variation between maximum and
minimum concentration is measured by the degree
of fluctuation, called DFL, calculated as
(C-C)/CwithC theaverage
max minavg, avg
concentration over a dosing interval. Appx. 463
1128.
The district court observed that the in vivo azithromycin
controlled release formulations in the PCT Application
have less total bioavailability than their immediate
release counterparts, supporting Abbott's argument
that the behavior of differing biological systems, even
when structurally similar, is not predictable. See Alza
Corp. v. Mylan Laboratories, 464 F.3d 1286, 1297
(Fed.Cir.2006) (Alza's evidence of in vitro dissolution
*1350 rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating
that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo
behavior.). The district court concluded that the in vivo
extended release properties claimed in the '718 patent
are sufficiently dissimilar to or unpredictable from the
in vitro controlled release data for azithromycin in the
PCT Application that a person of ordinary skill in the
field of the invention would not have had the degree of
confidence of success in transferring the PCT Application's
azithromycin formulation to the different metabolic
and solubility systems of clarithromycin as would
render the '718 claimed invention unpatentable on the
ground of obviousness.
In reaching these conclusions, the district court relied
on the Federal Circuit's decision on the same pat

ents in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 473 F.3d 1196 (Fed.Cir.2007) (herein  Andrx ).
This court, sustaining the district court's grant of a preliminary
injunction, had concluded that obviousness
was not likely to be established, reversing this court's
prior ruling reversing the grant of a preliminary injunction
in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 452 F.3d 1331 (Fed.Cir.2006) (herein  Teva ).
Sandoz argued to the district court that the Federal Cir-
cuit's ruling in Andrx is incorrect, and on this appeal
Sandoz urges us to reject Andrx and reinstate Teva.
In Teva a panel of this court held that the claims of
the '718 patent were likely to be held not infringed. This
court also stated that there was a substantial likelihood
that claim 4 of the '718 patent would be held invalid for
obviousness based on the PCT Application together
with the '190 patent. This court held that the preliminary
injunction should be denied, although the panel cautioned
that its ruling in no way resolves the ultimate
question of invalidity. Teva, 452 F.3d at 1347. In Andrx
a later panel of this court, on an enlarged record, rejected
the invalidity ruling in Teva and held that the
'718 claims were likely to withstand the attack on validity.
Andrx, 473 F.3d at 1203-07.
Reviewing this history as applied to Sandoz' arguments
herein, the district court explained that this court
in Teva had not been made aware of the differences
between the pharmacokinetic criteria described in the '
190 patent and those of the '718 patent. The district
court explained that the pharmacokinetic data in the '
190 patent were based on measurements of total antibiotic
activity in the body, which includes both clarithromycin
and its active metabolite formed after ingestion,
whereas the data in the '718 patent are specific to clarithromycin
alone. The court found that Abbott has
shown...thatthePKprofileoftheclarithromycin-metabolite
data of the '190 patent formulation was not the same
as the PK profile of the clarithromycin-only data utilized
by the '718 patent, Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 841.
Sandoz argued, in its supplemental briefing in the
district court after the KSR decision, that this court's decision
in Andrx does not survive scrutiny under the principles
set forth in KSR, and stressed that application of
KSR renders it obvious to try the various release
agents in the PCT Application, such that any successful
composition would be unpatentable, whether or not the
results were predictable. Sandoz argued that the '190
patent shows that clarithromycin and azithromycin have
similarities as well as differences, and that it would be
obvious to experiment to determine which formulations
were effective in view of these differences and similarities.
Sandoz stressed that the Abbott scientists had
knowledge of the prior art including the PCT Application,
and that they developed the Abbott formulation in
only one month of research effort. Sandoz quoted the
Court's admonition in KSR that a *1351 court can take
account of the inferences and creative steps that a person
of ordinary skill in the art would employ, 127 S.Ct.
at 1741, and that [t]he combination of familiar elements
according to known methods is likely to be obvious
when it does no more than yield predictable results.
Id. at 1739.
The district court, applying KSR, reconsidered its
prior determination and framed the question as
whether an ordinary person skilled in the art would
have seen a benefit to combining an erythromycin derivative
with a polymer with the same PK [ pharmacokinetic]
limitations as embodied in claims 1 and 4 of
the '718 patent given the state of the pharmaceutical
industry at the time. Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 851. The
court concluded: Based upon what evidence and argument
Sandoz offered, the answer was and remains no.
Id. The district court explained that this Court's preliminary
factual findings ... found that Sandoz had not produced
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were
disclosed in the prior art or were inherent to the structural
limitations of the prior art compositions. Id. at
852. The district court observed that [t]he KSR opinion
only focused on the Federal Circuit's strict use of the
TSM [teaching, suggestion, motivation] test in performing
the obviousness analysis; it did not mention or affect
the requirement that each and every claim limitation
be found present in the combination of the prior art
references before the analysis proceeds. Id. at 852.
We agree that the obviousness of selection of components,
when there is no prediction in the prior art as

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
to the results obtainable from a selected component, differs
from the issue in KSR, where the Court provided
guidance that a court must ask whether the improvement
is more than the predictable use of prior art elements
according to their established functions. 127
S.Ct. at 1740. The Court explained the conditions in
which obvious to try may negate patentability, depending
on the relation of the prior art teaching to the
later-developed technology. The Court explained that
when the problem is known, the possible approaches to
solving the problem are known and finite, and the solution
is predictable through use of a known option, then
the pursuit of the known option may be obvious even
absent a teaching, suggestion, or motivation concerning
that option. Then, if this leads to the anticipated
success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of
ordinary skill and common sense. 127 S.Ct. at 1742.
Abbott argued that the known options in the prior
art were not finite, identified, and predictable, the
words of KSR, and are identified only with hindsight
knowledge of Abbott's new formulation and its pharmacokinetic
properties. Abbott pointed to the discussion in
the PCT Application of over a dozen possible drug delivery
modes, including matrix systems, membrane-
moderated or reservoir systems, osmotic pumps, coated
hydrogel tablets and multi particulates, sustained release
compositions with delayed-release layers, pH-dependent
coated tablets, bursting osmotic core devices, bursting
coated swelling core devices, pH-triggered bursting osmotic
core devices, pH-triggered bursting coated swelling
core devices, enzyme-triggered supported liquid
membrane devices, bacterially degradable coating
devices, and swelling plug devices, all classes of controlled
release for drug delivery systems, each containing
sub-classes and variations. PCT App. at 8-38. The
expert witnesses pointed out the difficulties in predicting
the behavior of any composition in any specific biological
system.
The evaluation of the choices made by a skilled scientist,
when such choices lead to the desired result, is a
challenge to judicial *1352 understanding of how technical
advance is achieved in the particular field of science
or technology. Such understanding is critical to ju
dicial implementation of the national policy embodied
in the patent statute. In Publication of Tomlinson, 53
C.C.P.A. 1421, 363 F.2d 928 (1966) our predecessor
court discussed the role of obvious to try in scientific
and technologic research and in patentability:
Slight reflection suggests, we think, that there is usually
an element of obviousness to try in any research
endeavor, that is not undertaken with complete
blindness but rather with some semblance of a chance
of success, and that patentability determinations
based on that as the test would not only be contrary to
statute but result in a marked deterioration of the entire
patent system as an incentive to invest in those efforts
and attempts which go by the name of
research.
Id. at 931. The Court in KSR did not create a presumption
that all experimentation in fields where there
is already a background of useful knowledge is
obvious to try, without considering the nature of the
science or technology. The methodology of science and
the advance of technology are founded on the investigator's
educated application of what is known, to intelligent
exploration of what is not known. Each case must
be decided in its particular context, including the characteristics
of the science or technology, its state of advance,
the nature of the known choices, the specificity
or generality of the prior art, and the predictability of
results in the area of interest.
The district court discussed the differences between
the pharmacokinetic properties shown in the '190 patent
reference and the properties in the ' 718 patent
claims, the differences in the chemical and biological
properties of azithromycin and clarithromycin, the differences
between in vitro and in vivo data, and the differences
between azithromycin and clarithromycin. For
example, Abbott's expert Dr. Davis stated that the absorption
of clarithromycin is affected by a phenomenon
know as the first pass effect which does not occur for
azithromycin, and that azithromycin's metabolism occurs
only post-absorption. Dr. Davis also stated that
the half-life for azithromycin is about 70 hours, whereas
that for clarithromycin is about 3-4 hours at low IR
doses. First-pass metabolism was explained as mean

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
ing that a significant amount of the drug is metabolized
and converted into another compound before it enters
the circulation; Dr. Davis stated that a person of skill in
this field, having this knowledge, would not have assumed
that the two drugs would exhibit similar behavior
if placed in the same formulation. The district court
concluded that it was not predictable, from the in vitro
behavior of azithromycin, how any specific clarithromycin
extended release formulation would perform in
vivo.
Sandoz presented other arguments, for example,
that the FDA regulations state the requirements for approval
of extended release formulations, thereby rendering
obvious a formulation that meets these requirements.
However, knowledge of the goal does not render
its achievement obvious. The district court appropriately
applied the KSR standard of whether the patents
in suit represented an identified, predictable solution
and anticipated success, the words of KSR, to the
problem of producing extended release formulations
having the pharmacokinetic properties in the claims.
On the record of the preliminary injunction proceedings,
and considering this court's ruling in Andrx
and the guidance of the Court in KSR, we do not discern
reversible error in the district court's ruling that Abbott
is likely to prevail on the *1353 issues of patent validity
based on anticipation and obviousness.
II
INEQUITABLE CONDUCT
Sandoz also argued that the '718 and '616 patents
are unenforceable due to Abbott's inequitable conduct
in the Patent and Trademark Office. Sandoz stated that
Abbott submitted a false declaration to the PTO, and
also that Abbott withheld from the examiner the results
of certain tests after the patent applications were filed
and that were inconsistent with information in the patent
applications. The district court found that there was
no intent to deceive the examiner, and that the criticized
activity did not constitute inequitable conduct.
[1][2] The evidentiary standard for determining
whether there was inequitable conduct in obtaining a
patent that is otherwise valid was set forth by this court,
sitting en banc for the purpose, in Kingsdown Medical
Consultants, Ltd. v. Hollister Inc., 863 F.2d 867
(Fed.Cir.1988). The court explained that [t]o be guilty
of inequitable conduct, one must have intended to act
inequitably, and held: Inequitable conduct resides in
failure to disclose material information, or submission
of false material information, with an intent to deceive,
and those two elements, materiality and intent, must be
proven by clear and convincing evidence. Id. at 872.
Mistake or negligence, even gross negligence, does not
support a ruling of inequitable conduct. The court held:
We adopt the view that a finding that particular conduct
amounts to gross negligence does not of itself
justify an inference of intent to deceive; the involved
conduct, viewed in light of all the evidence, including
evidence indicative of good faith, must indicate sufficient
culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive.
Id. at 876. When both materiality and deceptive intent
have been established the district court determines,
in the court's discretion, whether inequitable conduct
has occurred; appellate review is on this basis. See id. at
876 (As an equitable issue, inequitable conduct is committed
to the discretion of the trial court and is reviewed
by this court under an abuse of discretion standard. We,
accordingly, will not simply substitute our judgment for
that of the trial court in relation to inequitable conduct.).
The '718 patent
[3] Sandoz first challenges the district court's findings
with respect to a declaration by an inventor, Dr.
Linda Gustavson, comparing the products of the
pending '718 application with the products in a prior art
Abbott patent, U.S. Patent No. 4,808,411, directed to a
pediatric clarithromycin suspension that is administered
twice daily. Dr. Gustavson submitted data to the PTO
comparing the '718 and the '411 formulations, and
stated that the ER [extended release] formulation as
claimed, is supported by the above results, namely, C
of clarithromycin in plasma is statistically signific
max
antly lower than that for IR [immediate release] formulation
given twice daily. The declaration also stated
that AUC is maintained over 24 hours; and Cis
min

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
substantially equivalent to that of the IR suspension.
FN3
However, in this litigation Dr. Gustavson testified
that she had not analyzed statistical significance, and
that it could not definitively be concluded from the
data that the difference between the ER C and the C
max
for a twice-a-day dosed suspension would have
max
*1354 been statistically significantly different. Based
on this admission, Sandoz argued that the Gustavson
submission to the PTO was a material misrepresentation,
that intent to deceive is presumed, and that inequitable
conduct was thereby established.
FN3. The AUC is a calculation of the area under
a curve when drug concentration is plotted
over time, and is a measure of bioavailability
of the drug. Cis the minimum rug concen
min
tration over a dosing interval.
Abbott did not dispute that Dr. Gustavson did not
analyze statistical significance, but argued that it was
not material to patentability and that a reasonable examiner
would not have found otherwise. Abbott pointed
out that the actual data were before the PTO, and that
the results did show a numerically lower Cvalue.
max
Sandoz pointed out to the district court that Abbott's
patent attorney argued nonobviousness to the PTO
based on the Gustavson declaration, and Abbott responded
that the declaration correctly stated that the pharmacokinetic
properties of the product in the '411 patent
are markedly different from those of the product of
the '718 patent. We have been directed to no evidence
of deceptive intent, or bad faith or intentional misconduct,
in the words of PTO Rule 56; on this appeal San-
doz repeats that deceptive intent should be inferred
from the misstatement.
The district court cited Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis
Pharm., Inc., 468 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2006) for
its summary that a ruling of inequitable conduct requires
clear and convincing evidence that the applicant
while prosecuting the patent (1) made an affirmative
misrepresentation of material fact, failed to disclose material
information, or submitted false material information,
and (2) intended to deceive the [PTO]. In determining
materiality, the district court applied the standard
that [u]ndisclosed information is material if it satisfies
37 C.F.R.  1.56 and if there is a substantial likelihood
that a reasonable examiner would have considered the
undisclosed information important in deciding whether
to allow the patent to issue. Although the Federal Circuit
has not always been consistent in defining
materiality in accordance with the PTO Rules, the
principles are consistently directed to deceptive actions
by patent applicants. In Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles
Machine Works, 437 F.3d 1309 (Fed.Cir.2006) the court
observed that four separate tests have been applied for
materiality.
The district court, applying the tests of materiality
to the Gustavson statement about statistical significance,
stated that it was obviously troublesome that
Gustavson made her assertion without having actually
performed the statistical test. The district court concluded
that the Gustavson statement was not material to
patentability, despite the fact that it satisfies the definition
of material provided by 37 C.F.R.  1.56(b). The
court stated that:
Since 1) no claim of the '718 patent requires the extended
release formulation to have a statistically significant
lower Cmax than the immediate release formulation;
2) the data in fact shows the Cmax of the
extended release formulation to be lower (albeit not
statistically significantly lower) than the Cmax of the
immediate release formulation; and 3) the extended
release formulation was in fact pharmacokinetically
different from the immediate release suspension formulation,
it is more likely than not that the PTO
would not have found the statistically significantly
lower statement to be important.
500 F.Supp.2d at 822. Relevant is the ruling in Regents
of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d
1559, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1997) (that Information is material
if a reasonable examiner would have considered it
important to the patentability of a claim).
The district court also found that there was no evidence
of intent to deceive the examiner. The court rejected
Sandoz's argument that deceptive intent is inferred
*1355 from materiality alone, for precedent requires independent
proof of deceptive intent. See Kingsdown,
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

863 F.2d at 872 (intent to deceive the examiner into
granting the patent is a separate and essential element of
inequitable conduct in the PTO); Baker Oil Tools, Inc.
v. Geo Vann, Inc., 828 F.2d 1558, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1987)
(The material facts upon which a holding of inequitable
conduct rests relate to both the intent of the actor
and the materiality of the information.). Weighing the
materiality of the statement and the absence of evidence
of intent to deceive, we do not discern an abuse of discretion
in the district court's conclusion that inequitable
conduct was not established by the statement concerning
statistical significance.
Sandoz next challenged the fact that Abbott did not
provide to the patent examiner the results of some clinical
tests conducted after the '718 patent application was
filed, that were reported to the FDA and included on the
Biaxin  XL product label. The test results relate to
FN4
taste perversion results in a later clinical trial, and
a study comparing clarithromycin with azithromycin.
Sandoz stated that Abbott should have provided the patent
examiners with these results and the product label,
which report tests wherein the immediate release formulation
has a lower incidence of taste perversion than the
extended release formulation, contrary to the information
in the '718 patent. Sandoz argued that the inventors
knew or should have known of this discrepancy, and
thus that intent to deceive is established. Abbott responded
that the challenged taste tests were from dosages
that were not directly comparable, and that they did not
change the correctness of the data in the patent application.
Abbott presented the expert testimony of Dr. Davis
that the comparison between the taste perversion incidence
rate for Biaxin IR and Biaxin XL in the label
does not relate to the invention disclosed and claimed in
the '407 patent, which is for a reduction in taste perversion
for the same total dose. Supplemental Declaration
of Professor Stanley S. Davis, February 7,
2007(emphases in original).
FN4. Taste perversion is defined in the '718
patent as the perception of a bitter metallic
taste normally associated with erythromycin
derivatives, particularly, with clarithromycin.
Col. 3, lines 53-55.
[4] The district court concluded that the taste results
met the materiality criteria of Rule 56 but that a
reasonable examiner would not consider the information
important in deciding whether to grant the patent. The
court explained that a reasonable examiner would compare
data at comparable dosages, and that the data were
not comparable. Although Abbott and Sandoz argued
about whether the inventors knew or should have
known of this discrepancy between this taste data from
the Phase III clinical trial, and the taste data in the patent
application, the district court observed that there
was no evidence of deliberate withholding of this information
in order to deceive the patent examiner.
Intent to deceive can not be inferred solely from the
fact that information was not disclosed; there must be a
factual basis for a finding of deceptive intent. Hebert
v. Lisle Corp., 99 F.3d 1109, 1115, 1116 (Fed.Cir.1996)
(To establish inequitable conduct the information that
is known to the applicant and not provided to the PTO
must be both material to patentability, and withheld in
order to deceive or mislead the examiner.); Molins
PLC v. Textron, Inc., 48 F.3d 1172, 1181
(Fed.Cir.1995) (While intent to deceive the PTO may
be found as a matter of inference from circumstantial
evidence, circumstantial evidence cannot indicate
merely gross negligence.).
*1356 [5] Materiality is not evidence of intent,
which must be established as a separate factual element
of a discretionary ruling of inequitable conduct. The
district court finding that the factual premises of both
materiality and intent to deceive were not established in
connection with the taste data, did not abuse its discretion
in declining to find inequitable conduct on this
ground.
Finally, Sandoz criticized Abbott's failure to
provide the PTO with a study designated W98-268,
done after the patent application was filed, which compared
the pharmacokinetic values of clarithromycin
upon administration under various conditions. The district
court described the issue as: Abbott claimed that
the mean DFL values for a modified release version of
clarithromycin claimed by a prior patent, the '190 patent
, were substantially equal to the mean DFL values for

significantly lower mean DFL than that for the immediate
release formulation. 500 F.Supp.2d at 823. Sandoz
stated that Abbott committed inequitable conduct by
failing to disclose these results to the PTO.
Dr. Weiner stated in his January 9 Declaration that
the'190patentdoesnotdiscloseanyclarithromycin-specific
PK data, and the '190 patent does not disclose any
DFL values at all, and explained that subsequent studies
conducted by Abbott indicate that the commercial
embodiment of the invention of the '190 patent does not
have a statistically significantly lower DFL than the IR
formulation.... Before the present litigation, Abbott had
conducted five crossover studies in which the pharmacokinetic
parameters for clarithromycin (i.e., clarithromycin
specifically, not clarithromycin combined with
its metabolite) were measured for both the MR
[modified release] and IR formulations: W95-914,
W95-195, W95-197, W98-268 [the study that Sandoz
accuses Abbott of withholding], and TAI-99-001. The
mean DFL values in Table VII in the '718 patent are
based on Study W95-195. See Supplemental Declaration
of Dr. Ronald Sawchuk, February 7, 2007 (Table
VII reflects data from a multiple dose study involving
MR formulation and an IR formulation that was conducted
in Germany in 1995. See Ex. 12, Study
W95-195.). The studies conducted before the '718 patent
application was filed showed the data reported in the
specification.
Many details were explained to the district court, as
to all the studies, their context, and their relationship.
The district court found that contrary to Sandoz's assertion,
Study W98-268 does not demonstrate that the
prior art MR formulation has the same PK properties as
that claimed for the ER formulation. Therefore, Study
W98-268 is not material to the patentability of the '718
patent. Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 824. The district court
found that the '718 patent speaks of the PK relationship
of extended release and immediate release formulations,
not of modified release and immediate release formulations
.... [and] there is no evidence showing the DFL of
the ER formulation to be anything but consistently statistically
significantly lower than the DFL of the IR formulation.
Id. The district court found that the W98-268
study was not material under either Rule 56 or the reasonable
examiner standard. Clear error has not been
shown in this finding.
On the preliminary injunction record, the district
court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Sandoz
was not likely to succeed in establishing inequitable
conduct in Abbott's prosecution of the '718 patent application.
We agree with the district *1357 court that
the scales do not tilt towards finding inequitable conduct.
Id. at 829.
The '616 patent
[6] Sandoz argued that inequitable conduct as to the
taste perversion claim in the '718 patent taints the '616
patent because a taste perversion claim was included in
the '616 application when it was filed, although that
claim was cancelled before any PTO examination on the
merits. The district court declined to hold the '616 patent
unenforceable based on a withdrawn claim, citing
37 C.F.R.  1.56(a):
Rule 56(a). The duty to disclose information exists
with respect to each pending claim until the claim is
cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application
becomes abandoned. Information material to
the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn
from consideration need not be submitted if the
information is not material to the patentability of any
claim remaining under consideration in the application.
The district court deemed it wholly inequitable to
hold a patent to be invalid for fraudulent conduct in the
prosecution of a claim that was withdrawn before actual
prosecution had even begun. Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at
829. This court held in Scripps Clinic & Research
Found. v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1583
(Fed.Cir.1991) that [a] reference that is material only
to withdrawn claims can not be the basis of a holding of
inequitable conduct. Rule 56 is in accord.
Sandoz also argued as to the '616 patent that Abbott

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
did not report to the PTO the results of clinical trials
conducted before the continuation in-part ' 616 application
was filed. Sandoz' expert Dr. Marcello Pagano, in
his Declaration dated January 25, 2007, stated: I have
reviewed the bronchitis and sinusitis studies [and] the
claims of the '616 patent for a method of reducing
gastrointestinal adverse side effects are not supported
by the data from those two clinical studies. The results
of these studies were provided to the FDA, but not to
the PTO. Dr. Pagano stated: Since neither the sinusitis
nor the bronchitis studies produced favorable results to
support a claimed reduction in gastrointestinal adverse
side effects, Abbott had to manipulate its data and report
the number of discontinuations due to gastrointestinal
adverse side effects to the PTO ... The district
court found that the information from these clinical trials
was not material to patentability, stating that: it is
clear from both Table VI and Table VIII [of the '616
patent] that some data demonstrating no change in the
subcategories of GI adverse side effects of abdominal
pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence and
nausea were in fact disclosed to the PTO. Abbott, 500
F.Supp.2d at 828. These findings have not been shown
to be clearly erroneous.
[7] There was no evidence of intent to deceive with
respect to the results of these clinical trials. Materiality,
even if found, does not establish intent. This is not a
case of new information that affects the fundamental invention;
this is a case of challenging every action or inaction
of the conduct of patent solicitation, although
patentability is unaffected. The purpose of Kingsdown
was to bring patent practice into the mainstream of the
law and administrative practice. The law severely punishes
fraudulent practices, and the patent practice includes
recognition that the inventor usually knows more
about the field than does the expert patent examiner.
However, routine actions that do not affect patentability
and that are devoid of fraudulent intent are not subject
to a different standard than other inquiries into fraudulent
procurement. The Administrative Procedure Act
governs patent examination, See Dickinson v. Zurko,
527 U.S. 150, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 144 L.Ed.2d 143 (1999),
*1358 and actions of patent examiners are reviewed
with recognition of examiner expertise so well as recognition
of the occasionally imperfect examination process.
It was to mitigate the plague whereby every
patentee's imperfections were promoted to inequitable
conduct that this court reaffirmed that both materiality
and culpable intent must be established. Allied Colloids,
Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 64 F.3d 1570,
1578 (Fed.Cir.1995).
We conclude that the district court did not abuse its
discretion in holding that the '718 and '616 patents were
not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable
conduct in obtaining the patents.
III
INFRINGEMENT
[8][9] The first step in most infringement suits is
the procedure called claim construction, where the
scope of the claim is defined by the court. At the preliminary
injunction stage the district court's claim construction
is reviewed, as for other legal issues, for the
likelihood of correctness of the ruling. This likelihood
is based on the underlying facts as found at this stage of
the proceedings, recognizing that the burdens at the
preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.
Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do
Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163
L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006).
For the patents here in suit, the issue of infringement
was resolved, at this preliminary injunction stage,
as a matter of claim construction. The dispositive question
was whether the term pharmaceutically acceptable
polymer is limited to the polymers named in the specification,
or can include other pharmaceutically acceptable
polymers. If so limited, it is likely that there would
not be literal infringement; if not so limited, then literal
infringement would be possible. (Infringement under
the doctrine of equivalents was not addressed by the
district court, although Sandoz argues the issue in an
abundance of caution.).
The meaning and scope of pharmaceutically acceptable
polymer as used in these patents has been litigated
in other cases, none of which had been finally decided,
but some of which had been appealed to the Federal
Circuit based on the grant of a preliminary injunc

tion. The district court now construed
pharmaceutically acceptable polymer in accordance
with the construction by the Federal Circuit in Andrx,
supra. Sandoz argues on this appeal that the correct
construction is that of the Federal Circuit's earlier decision
in Teva, supra. Sandoz argues that because Teva
was the earlier ruling, it could not be overturned by the
later Andrx panel, citing Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney
Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed.Cir.1988) (Where
there is a direct conflict [between Federal Circuit panels],
the precedential decision is the first.).
Abbott responds that the decision in Andrx was
properly followed by this district court, for in Teva the
construction of pharmaceutically acceptable polymer
was not at issue, and this court's comment thereon
was dictum. The court in Andrx recognized the non-
binding nature of that comment in Teva. Indeed, the district
court in Teva had stated that [a]t this early stage
of the proceedings, the parties have raised no issue as to
claim construction. Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., No. 05 C 1490, 2005 WL
1323435, at *3, *4 (N.D.Ill. June 03, 2005) (Teva conceding
literal infringement but challenging validity).
The panel in Andrx decided the questions now
raised by Sandoz concerning the construction of
pharmaceutically acceptable polymer and the pharmacokinetic
requirements in the claims. The Andrx panel
also explained its departure from the *1359 panel decision
in Teva. The district court herein, applying Andrx
, held that a person of ordinary skill in this field would
interpret  pharmaceutically acceptable polymer in
terms of the following description in the '718 specification:
Pharmaceutically acceptable as used herein,
means those compounds, which are, within the scope
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact
with the tissues of humans and lower animals without
undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the
like, in keeping with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio,
and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy
and prophylaxis of antimicrobial infections.
'718 patent, col. 3 lines 40-47. The district court
referred to the '718 specification's listing of pharmaceutically
acceptable polymers, but applied the Andrx
ruling that the polymers are not limited to those that are
named in the following paragraph:
The pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is a water-
soluble hydrophilic polymer selected from the group
consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine, hydroxypropyl
cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl
cellulose, vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers,
methacrylic acid copolymers, maleic anhydride/
methyl vinyl ether copolymers and derivatives and
mixtures thereof.
'718 patent, col. 3 line 65 to col. 4 line 4. The district
court construed  pharmaceutically acceptable
polymer as:
[A]ny polymer, which within the scope of sound medical
judgment is suitable for use in pharmaceutical
compositions for use in contact with the tissues of humans
and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation,
allergic response, and the like, in keeping with
a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their
intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of
antimicrobial infections, and is capable of forming a
matrix to extend drug release into the bloodstream.
Such a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer must
constitute 5 to 50% by weight of the product.
Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 834. The district court,
following Andrx, held that the usage from the group
consisting of in the specification is not exclusive, as it
would be in a Markush-form claim, and did not negate
the broader description that is also contained in the specification,
as quoted above.
This aspect was debated in the district court, and
again on this appeal. Sandoz argues that since
pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is limited by the
specification to water-soluble hydrophilic polymers, and
that since the listed methacrylic acid copolymers are
known to include water-insoluble as well as water-soluble
polymers, the term pharmaceutically acceptable
polymer must be construed to mean that the formulation
cannot include any water-insoluble methacrylic
acid or other polymer. The district court, receiving this
argument, reasoned that the existence of water-in

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 18
544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161
(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
soluble polymers from the specifically-mentioned
methacrylic acid co-polymer subset actually militates
towards a broader construction urged by Abbott that
would encompass water-insoluble methacrylic acid copolymers.
Abbott, 500 F.Supp.2d at 834. Sandoz argues
that this reasoning is flawed, and that this court in
Andrx erred in rejecting this argument. However, we are
not persuaded that the Andrx panel's ruling warrants rejection
on this argument, for we agree with the district
court that the fact that some methacrylic acid copolymers
are water-insoluble does not require limiting
pharmaceutically acceptable polymer to the named
polymers.
We conclude that the district court's claim construction,
which is that of Andrx, is correct, and that the district
court properly*1360 declined to follow Teva. San-
doz' argument that Teva was the correct construction
and should be revived by the Federal Circuit is hard to
square with Sandoz' statement to the district court that
a very important point to make here is Sandoz does not
rely on the Federal Circuit opinion in the Teva case....
Sandoz agrees with Abbott. Statement at the February
12, 2007 preliminary injunction hearing, transcript at
A11085.
Sandoz further argues that the district court erred
by using the word matrix in its definition of
pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, quoted above,
pointing out that this word does not appear in the claims
or specification. However, claim construction often
calls upon words other than those of the patent, lest the
claim simply define itself. Claim construction is for
the purpose of explaining and defining terms in the
claims, and usually requires use of words other than the
words that are being defined. See Multiform Desiccants,
Inc. v. Medzam, Ltd., 133 F.3d 1473, 1477
(Fed.Cir.1998) (claims are construed as an aid to the decision-
maker, by restating the claims in non-technical
terms).
Abbott's expert Dr. Davis had used the word
matrix in his explanation of the technology of extended
release. He explained that a pharmaceutically acceptable
polymer ... alone or in combination with other
polymers, is capable of forming a matrix when mixed
with the drug to control and extend drug release into the
GI tract and thence to the bloodstream. Declaration of
Professor Davis, January 10, 2007. Sandoz does not dispute
that this explanation comports with the description
in the specification. Also, Abbott cites several scientific
publications that use the word matrix in this context,
and Sandoz does not argue that the word has a different
meaning from that with which it was used by the district
court. There is no ground for discarding the district
court's claim construction based on the word matrix.
Sandoz also argued that the claims must be construed
so that the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer
is the only release agent in the composition, argued
that the presence of any other agent that affects release
of the drug removes the composition from the
scope of the '718 claims. Abbott pointed out that the
claims use the conventional signal comprising, which
means that other ingredients may be present in the composition,
in addition to those explicitly set forth. See
CIAS, Inc. v. Alliance Gaming Corp., 504 F.3d 1356,
1360 (Fed.Cir.2007) (In the patent claim context the
term comprising is well understood to mean
including but not limited to.); Georgia-Pacific Corp.
v. United States Gypsum Co., 195 F.3d 1322, 1327-28
(Fed.Cir.1999) ( comprising ... is inclusive or open-
ended and does not exclude additional unrecited elements
or method steps).
Sandoz argues that the district court's claim construction
is incorrect because it ignores the distinction
between pharmaceutically acceptable polymers and
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. We discern
no support for this challenge. Abbott points out that the
distinction between polymer and excipient lies in
its role in the composition, as the patent states: The
compositions of the invention further comprise pharmaceutically
acceptable excipients and/or fillers and
extenders, such as lactose .... '718 patent, col. 4, lines
21-23. We discern no flawed judicial understanding of
the term excipient.
Sandoz also argued that the components of its accused
formulation are merely excipients in that they
do not extend the release of the clarithromycin, while
Abbott pointed out that Sandoz described its product to
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161
(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
the FDA as extended release. *1361 Sandoz stated
that the extension of release for its product is achieved
not by the polymer that is present in its composition,
but by other components. The district court considered
the arguments concerning the role of the maltodextrin
and the silicified microcrystalline cellulose in the San-
doz product. The court discussed the evidence of release
rates and amounts released, including the information in
Sandoz' approved ANDA, the comparative data presented
by both sides, and various technical articles
provided by both sides on the physical and chemical
characteristics of the components of the Sandoz formulation.
The court found that Abbott has demonstrated a
substantial likelihood that maltodextrin is a polymer
that alone or in combination with other polymers, is
capable of forming a matrix to extend drug release. Abbott,
500 F.Supp.2d at 837.
Sandoz argues that the district court erred in its
evaluation of the evidence, stating that Abbott did not
show by direct testing that any of the polymers in the
Sandoz product actually extends the release of clarithromycin.
Sandoz argues that the district court erred in
finding unpersuasive certain laboratory tests conducted
by Sandoz to show that maltodextrin has no significant
impact on the dissolution rate of clarithromycin. Abbott
responds that the district court did not err, and that San-
doz must be deemed to have admitted that maltodextrin
and silicified microcrystalline cellulose are polymers
that, alone or in combination with other components,
are capable of extending drug release. Abbott pointed
out to the district court that the developer of the Sandoz
formulation, Dr. Nirmal Mulye, in his patent application
(U.S.2004/0224017 A1) entitled Process for Preparing
Sustained Release Tablets, stated that the present inventor
has found that the addition of maltodextrin in effective
amounts provides the desired release profile,
that maltodextrin also tends to slow down the release
of a medicament in a controlled release formulation[,]
and that the maltodextrin used in the present invention
is to counteract the accelerated rate of release of the
drug ... We have not been directed to clear error in the
district court's findings on this question.
Sandoz raises additional arguments, some discussed
by the district court, and some newly presented on this
appeal. All have been considered. We conclude that the
district court's findings and rulings at this stage of the
proceedings have not been shown to constitute reversible
error. The ruling that Abbott had shown a reasonable
likelihood of proving infringement is sustained.
IV
THE EQUITABLE FACTORS
Sandoz states that the district court incorrectly resolved
and weighed the equitable factors relevant to the
grant of a preliminary injunction. Sandoz states that the
factors of irreparable harm, the balance of harms, and
the public interest, all weigh in its favor, and outweigh
any finding that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues
of validity or enforceability and infringement. The district
court considered these factors, and explained its
reasoning in exercising its discretion to grant the preliminary
injunction.
Irreparable Harm
[10] Sandoz argued that any harm to Abbott is not
irreparable, for damages are available for infringement,
if the eventual final judgment is adverse to Sandoz.
Sandoz pointed out that the generic producers Teva and
Ranbaxy are already in this market, by settlement with
Abbott, such that any price erosion due to generic competition
is already occurring. The district court considered
these relationships, and *1362 concluded that
they do not negate the market share and revenue loss
upon Sandoz' entry while the litigation proceeds. Precedent
supports this conclusion. See, e.g., Purdue
Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, 237 F.3d
1359, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2001) (likelihood of price erosion
and loss of market position are evidence of irreparable
harm); Bio-Technology Gen. Corp. v. Genentech, Inc.,
80 F.3d 1553, 1566 (Fed.Cir.1996) (loss of revenue,
goodwill, and research and development support constitute
irreparable harm); Polymer Technologies, Inc. v.
Bridwell, 103 F.3d 970, 975-76 (Fed.Cir.1996) (loss of
market opportunities cannot be quantified or adequately
compensated, and is evidence of irreparable harm).
The Balance of Hardships
[11] The district court discussed and weighed the
hardships argued by both parties, and found that the bal

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 20
544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161
(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
ance of hardships tipped in favor of Abbott. The court
found that preserving the status quo preserves the current
market structure, recognizing that Abbott has licensed
other generic producers. The district court concluded
that Abbott will lose much more if this Court
did not enjoin Sandoz's infringing conduct than if the
Court enjoins Sandoz and it is subsequently found that
the '718 patent is invalid or unenforceable. Abbott, 500
F.Supp.2d at 845.
We agree that the fact that a patentee has licensed
others under its patents does not mean that unlicensed
infringement must also be permitted while the patents
are litigated. Precedent illustrates that when the patentee
is simply interested in obtaining licenses, without itself
engaging in commerce, equity may add weight to permitting
infringing activity to continue during litigation,
on the premise that the patentee is readily made whole
if infringement is found. In this case the district court
received Abbott's argument that it could not be made
whole if it prevails in this litigation, for the added
erosion of markets, customers, and prices, is rarely reversible.
See Sanofi-Synthelabo, 470 F.3d at 1383
(rejecting hardship claim of generic challenger whose
harms were almost entirely preventable' and were the
result of its own calculated risk to launch its product
prejudgment).
Clear error has not been shown in the district
court's finding that the harm to Sandoz of delay in entering
this market while this case is litigated, is outweighed
by the harm to Abbott in view of the likelihood
that Abbott will succeed in sustaining the validity and
enforceability of its patents.
The Public Interest
[12] Sandoz argues that the public interest favors
the availability of less expensive forms of successful
medicines. The district court considered this argument,
and stated:
The Court recognizes the public interest in competition
in the pharmaceutical market. It also recognizes,
however, the public interest in creating beneficial and
useful products and the cost involved in that process.
To the extent that this Court has found a substantial
likelihood that the '718 patent is valid and enforceable,
there can be no serious argument that public interest
is not best served by enforcing it.
500 F.Supp.2d at 846. The district court appreciated
that the public interest includes consideration of whether,
by shifting market benefits to the infringer while litigation
is pending for patents that are likely to withstand
the attack, the incentive for discovery and development
of new products is adversely affected. The statutory
period of exclusivity reflects the congressional
balance of interests, and warrants weight in considering
the public interest. In Sanofi-Synthelabo, 470 F.3d at
1383, this court referred to the significant*1363 public
interest in encouraging investment in drug development
and protecting the exclusionary rights conveyed in valid
pharmaceutical patents. As the Court explained in
Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 94
S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974): The patent laws
promote this progress by offering a right of exclusion
for a limited period as an incentive to inventors to risk
the often enormous costs in terms of time, research, and
development. Id. at 480, 94 S.Ct. 1879.
Sandoz states that the Court's recent decision in
eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 126
S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) negates any presumption
of entitlement to an injunction upon a finding
of likelihood that a patent will be sustained and found
infringed. The district court did not apply such a presumption,
but fully considered all of the legal and equitable
factors. At the preliminary injunction stage, the
legal and equitable factors may be of different weight
when the patentee is itself engaged in commerce, as
contrasted with a patentee that is seeking to license its
patent to others. We need not resolve this aspect for all
possible situations, for as between Abbott and Sandoz
the district court objectively weighed the legal probabilities
and the equities, and exercised its discretionary
judgment as to the entirety of the cause. We have been
shown no basis for believing that the district court abused
its discretion.
V
THE INJUNCTION BOND
Sandoz also appeals the amount of the injunction
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 21
544 F.3d 1341, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161
(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
bond, which the district court set at $40 million. Sandoz
provides no substance for appellate review of the
amount of the bond, simply stating in its brief that it
presented [to the district court] at least colorable evidence
that its losses from the injunction and recall would
be $200 million, but not describing the evidence or arguing
its merits. Sandoz simply states that its proposed
number should have been accepted, in the event that the
$40 million is later shown to be inadequate.
This aspect has not been presented in reviewable
substance. On this appeal, abuse of discretion has been
shown in the district court's setting of the terms of the
injunction. See Russell v. Farley, 105 U.S. 433, 441, 26
L.Ed. 1060 (1881) (the court's discretion in setting the
terms of an injunction is rooted in equity).
VI
THE ISSUE OF CONFLICTING PRECEDENT
The district court found the likelihood that the patentee
would succeed on the merits and that the equities
favored the patentee, and exercised its discretion to enjoin
infringement during the litigation. The dissent
states that the district court applied the incorrect standard,
and that if the infringer raises a substantial question
concerning either infringement or validity, diss.
op. at 1371, it is an abuse of discretion to enjoin infringement
pendente lite. The dissent quotes with approval
a past panel statement that In resisting a preliminary
injunction, however, one need not make out a case
of actual validity. Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary
injunction stages, while validity is the issue at
trial. Id. Indeed, this court's precedent makes this statement,
in direct conflict with other, earlier statements
that the standard is not vulnerability, but likelihood of
success on the merits.
In response to the arguments expounded in the dissenting
opinion, I summarize the law governing the
grant of a preliminary injunction. The criteria relied on
in *1364 the dissent are not the criteria of any other circuit,
nor of the Supreme Court. The correct standard is
not whether a substantial question has been raised, but
whether the patentee is likely to succeed on the merits,
upon application of the standards of proof that will prevail
at trial. The question is not whether the patent is
vulnerable; the question is who is likely to prevail in the
end, considered with equitable factors that relate to
whether the status quo should or should not be preserved
while the trial is ongoing. The presentation of
sufficient evidence to show the likelihood of prevailing
on the merits is quite different from the presentation of
substantial evidence to show vulnerability.
Thus the evidence that favors the patent must be
considered in deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction,
as well as the evidence against the patent. The
trial court then decides which side is likely ultimately to
prevail. The dissent presents only the case against the
patent, apparently on the theory that this is all that is
needed to raise a substantial question.
Indeed, a showing of a substantial question concerning
validity or infringement can serve to avert judgment
on the pleadings, or to avoid the grant of summary
judgment, but it is not the same as showing likelihood
of eventual success on the merits. The dissent recognizes
that it is not the same and that it requires less
proof, but errs in stating that this is sufficient to defeat
the grant of a preliminary injunction. Precedent is clear
that the standard is the likelihood of success of the
plaintiff at trial, with recognition of the presumptions
and burdens. See, e.g., Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings,

Supreme Court precedent, every regional circuit,
and controlling Federal Circuit precedent, apply to the
preliminary injunction the combination of criteria that
includes likelihood of success on the merits and equitable
considerations. No other court has held that when
the attacker has presented a substantial question on its
side of the dispute-that is, more than a scintilla but less
than a preponderance of evidence in support of its side-
no injunction pendente lite is available. Further, equitable
factors are of particular significance at the preliminary
stage, where the question is whether to change the
position of the parties during the litigation. See Camen

isch, 451 U.S. at 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830 (the preliminary
injunction preserves the position of the parties during
the litigation). The dissent does not mention the equitable
factors that were considered by the district court, as
required by precedent; the dissent simply states that the
injunction must be denied if the attacker has raised a
substantial question.
Supreme Court precedent is clear in stating that the
same burdens and standards of proof apply in deciding
the merits for preliminary injunction purposes, as in deciding
the same questions upon full litigation. See, e.g.,
Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211 (placing the
burdens of proof for showing likelihood of success at
the preliminary injunction stage). The Court explained
in Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, AK,
480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542
(1987) that: The standard for a preliminary injunction
is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction
with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood
of success on the merits rather than actual success.
*1365 There is no reason why patent cases require
unique treatment. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange,
L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641.
394 (2006) ([T]he decision whether to grant or deny
injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of
the district courts, and that such discretion must be exercised
consistent with traditional principles of equity,
in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed
by such standards.). The general criterion of likelihood
of success on the merits, in the context of the equities of
the particular case, are uniform throughout the regional
circuits. All are consistent with the rulings of the Supreme
Court, and, although the words vary, all refer to
the likelihood of the eventual outcome, not whether a
substantial question has been raised. In brief sampling,
starting with the First Circuit, the court summarized the
standard in Wine and Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,
418 F.3d 36 (1st Cir.2005):
The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood
of success on the merits: if the moving party
cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in
his quest, the remaining factors become matter of
idle curiosity.
Id. at 46 (citation omitted). The referenced
four-part inquiry is (1) the likelihood of success on
the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the
movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of
relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant
if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the
movant if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if
any) of the court's ruling on the public interest. Id.
(alteration in original) (citations omitted).
The Second Circuit also applies the standard four
factors. I cite a case that emphasized the equitable considerations;
in Laureyssens v. Idea Group, Inc., 964
F.2d 131, 135-36 (2nd Cir.1992) (emphasis in original)
the court stated: A party seeking a preliminary injunction
must establish (1) irreparable injury and (2) a likelihood
of success on the merits or a sufficiently serious
question going to the merits and a balance of hardships
tipping decidedly in the moving party's favor.
The Third Circuit also stated that the district court
must consider four factors: [A] the likelihood that the
applicant will prevail on the merits at final hearing; [B]
the extent to which the plaintiffs are being irreparably
harmed by the conduct complained of; [C] the extent to
which the defendants will suffer irreparable harm if the
preliminary injunction is issued; and [D] the public interest.
Opticians Ass'n of Am. v. Independent Opticians
of Am., 920 F.2d 187, 191-92 (3rd Cir.1990) (alterations
in original) (citation omitted). In Eli Lilly & Co. v.
Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., 630 F.2d 120
(3rd Cir.1980) the court explained that when analyzing
a preliminary injunction:
the moving party must generally show (1) a reasonable
probability of eventual success in the litigation
and (2) that the movant will be irreparably injured
pendente lite if relief is not granted.... Moreover,
while the burden rests upon the moving party to
make these two requisite showings, the district
court should take into account, when they are relevant,
(3) the possibility of harm to other interested
persons from the grant or denial of the injunction,
and (4) the public interest. ... While these factors

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
structure the inquiry, however, no one aspect will
necessarily determine its outcome. Rather, proper
judgment entails a delicate balancing of all elements.
On the basis of the data before it, the district
court must attempt to minimize the probable harm
to legally protected interests between the time that
the motion for a preliminary injunction*1366 is
filed and the time of the final hearing.
Id. at 136. Indeed, rulings of the Federal Circuit,
along with requiring this reasonable probability of
eventual success, have recognized the  delicate balancing
of all elements. See H.H. Robertson Co. v.
United Steel Deck, Inc., 820 F.2d 384, 387-88
(Fed.Cir.1987).
Similarly in the Fourth Circuit the inquiry is: 1)
Has the petitioner made a strong showing that it is
likely to prevail upon the merits? 2) Has the petitioner
shown that without such relief it will suffer irreparable
injury? 3) Would the issuance of the injunction substantially
harm other interested parties? 4) Wherein lies the
public interest? Blackwelder Furniture Co. of States-
ville, Inc. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 193 (4th
Cir.1977) (when reviewing the grant of denial of interim
injunctive relief our review of the lower court's application
of the law is not limited by the same clearly
erroneous' rule which restricts our review of its findings
of fact under Rule 52(a)); see First-Citizens Bank &
Trust Co. v. Camp, 432 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir.1970)
(applying the four-factors and reversing the district
court's grant of a preliminary injunction).
In the Fifth Circuit the four factors are recited as
(1) a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will prevail on
the merits, (2) a substantial threat that plaintiff will suffer
irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3)
that the threatened injury to plaintiff outweighs the
threatened harm the injunction may do to defendant,
and (4) that granting the preliminary injunction will not
disserve the public interest. Canal Authority of State of
Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir.1974).
The substantial likelihood of prevailing is not the
same as raising a substantial question.
Again for the Sixth Circuit, the well-established
factors are: (1) the likelihood that the party seeking the
preliminary injunction will succeed on the merits of the
claim; (2) whether the party seeking the injunction will
suffer irreparable harm without the grant of the extraordinary
relief; (3) the probability that granting the
injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4)
whether the public interest is advanced by the issuance
of the injunction, Six Clinics Holding Corp. II v. Cafcomp
Systems, Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir.1997).
The court recognized that a finding that the movant has
not established a strong probability of success on the
merits will not preclude a court from exercising its discretion
to issue a preliminary injunction if the movant
has, at minimum, show[n] serious questions going to
the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs
any potential harm to the defendant if the injunction
is issued.  Id. at 400 (alteration in original).
This ruling gave weight to the court's discretion to preserve
the status quo during the litigation, when the
equitable factors warrant such discretion.
In the Seventh Circuit:
As a threshold matter, a party seeking a preliminary
injunction must demonstrate (1) some likelihood of
succeeding on the merits, and (2) that it has no adequate
remedy at law and will suffer irreparable
harm if preliminary relief is denied. If the moving
party cannot establish either of these prerequisites,
a court's inquiry is over and the injunction must be
denied. If, however, the moving party clears both
thresholds, the court must then consider: (3) the irreparable
harm the non-moving party will suffer if
preliminary relief is granted, balancing that harm
against the irreparable harm to the moving party if
relief is denied; and (4) the public interest, meaning
the consequences of *1367 granting or denying the
injunction to nonparties.
Abbott Laboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971
F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir.1992). This court has observed that
the standard for granting or denying a motion for a preliminary
injunction is not unique to patent law, and has
ruled that the standard of the regional circuit should apply,
here the Seventh Circuit. See Mikohn Gaming

viewed the grant of a preliminary injunction as a matter
of procedural law not unique to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Federal Circuit, and on appellate review has
applied the procedural law of the regional circuit in
which the case was brought.).
In the Eighth Circuit, The relevant factors on a
motion for a preliminary injunction are: (1) the probability
of success on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable
harm to the movant; (3) the balance between this
harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict
on other interested parties; and (4) whether the issuance
of an injunction is in the public interest. Entergy,
Arkansas, Inc. v. Nebraska, 210 F.3d 887, 898
(8th Cir.2000). In Shrink Missouri Government PAC v.
Adams, 151 F.3d 763, 764 (8th Cir.1998) the court
stressed that [t]he most important of the [preliminary
injunction] factors is the appellants' likelihood of success
on the merits.
The Ninth Circuit stressed the importance of the
equitable factors: Preliminary injunctive relief is available
to a party who demonstrates either: (1) a combination
of probable success on the merits and the possibility
of irreparable harm; or (2) that serious questions are
raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor.
These two formulations represent two points on a sliding
scale in which the required degree of irreparable
harm increases as the probability of success decreases.

713-14 (9th Cir.2007).
In the Tenth Circuit, To obtain a preliminary injunction,
the moving party must establish that (1) the
moving party will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction
issues; (2) the threatened injury to the moving
party outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction
may cause the opposing party; (3) the injunction, if
issued, would not be adverse to the public interest; and
(4) there is a substantial likelihood that the moving
party will eventually prevail on the merits. Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Cruce, 972 F.2d 1195, 1199 (10th
Cir.1992) (When a party seeking a preliminary injunction
satisfies the first three requirements, the standard
for meeting the fourth probability of success' prerequisite
becomes more lenient. The movant need only
show questions going to the merits so serious, substantial,
difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair
ground for litigation. ).
In the Eleventh Circuit, A district court may grant
injunctive relief if the movant shows (1) a substantial
likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that irreparable
injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3)
that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs
whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the
opposing party, and (4) that if issued the injunction
would not be adverse to the public interest. All Care
Nursing Service, Inc. v. Bethesda Memorial Hosp. Inc.,
887 F.2d 1535, 1537 (11th Cir.1989).
In the District of Columbia Circuit, In considering
whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief, the court
must consider whether: (1) the party seeking the injunction
has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits;
(2) the party seeking the injunction will be irreparably
injured if relief is withheld; (3) an injunction will
not *1368 substantially harm other parties; and (4) an
injunction would further the public interest. CSX

(D.C.Cir.2005).
All of the circuits have placed the preliminary injunction
in terms of the likelihood of success on the
merits and equitable factors. No circuit has held that it
suffices simply to raise a substantial question. Raising
a substantial question achieves the threshold requirement
of the well-pleaded complaint; it does not demonstrate
a likelihood of prevailing. See Christianson v.
Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800,

849 F.2d 1446, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1988) ( The first

likelihood of success on the merits must be in
light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at
trial on the merits).
Summary
To summarize my concern for the conflict that is
here continued, I again point out that the dissenting
opinion, despite its initial recitation of the correct four-
part criteria for deciding the grant or denial of *1369 a
preliminary injunction, then applies the different and incorrect
criterion of whether the defendant raised a
substantial question that may render the patent
vulnerable. That standard conflicts with precedent of
the Supreme Court and all of the regional circuits, all of
which require that likelihood of success on the merits be
determined and weighed along with the equitable
factors. It is not the law that raising a substantial question
will negate the patentee's likelihood of success.
Diss. op. at 1372. Raising a substantial question may
avoid dismissal on the pleadings, but contrary to the
view of the dissent, establishing that there is an issue
for trial is not the same as establishing the likelihood of
prevailing at trial.
The district court analyzed the positions of both
sides as well as the equitable factors, decided that Abbott
was likely to prevail on the merits and that the
equitable factors weighed in favor of Abbott, and exercised
its discretion to grant the preliminary injunction.
The dissent states that a showing of vulnerability
shows that the defendant is likely to prevail on the merits;
that is facially incorrect. The dissent also relies on
some recent (2008) Federal Circuit decisions; these decisions
are not clearly established precedent, for they
cannot overcome earlier rulings of this court. Further,
until today no opinion has equated the raising of a
substantial question with a showing of likelihood of
success on the merits. The following additional cases of
the Federal Circuit are cited to show the established
law: Jeneric/Pentron, Inc. v. Dillon Co., Inc., 205 F.3d

These rulings of the Federal Circuit accord with the
principles of eBay, 547 U.S. at 394, 126 S.Ct. 1837, that
the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief
rests within the equitable discretion of the district
courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent
with traditional principles of equity, in patent
disputes no less than in other cases governed by such
standards. This court's contrary opinions stand alone.
If in fact this court *1371 believes that there should be a
different rule in patent cases, this court nonetheless has
the rule that in the event of conflict between panels the
earlier holding prevails until overturned en banc. Newell
Companies v. Kenney Mfg. Corp., 864 F.2d 757, 765
(Fed.Cir.1988) ( This court has adopted the rule that
prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent
on subsequent panels unless and until overturned
in banc.... Where there is a direct conflict, the precedential
decision is the first.). If there is to be a change
from this court's prior rulings, it must be done en banc.
As it stands, neither district courts, nor litigants,
nor panels of this court, are provided with clear guidance,
or any reason to reject the stricture of eBay, 547
U.S. at 393, 126 S.Ct. 1837, that [n]othing in the patent
Act indicates that Congress intended such a departure
from the long tradition of equity practice.
CONCLUSION
Abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district
court's grant of the preliminary injunction, adhered
to after additional consideration in view of the Court's
decision of KSR. The district court's findings of fact underlying
the legal and equitable considerations are supported,
and the judicial balancing of these considerations
shows no abuse of discretion. The grant of the in
junction is affirmed. The case is remanded for further
FN5
proceedings.
FN5. Sandoz requests that we instruct that on
remand this case should be assigned to a different
judge, in order to further the interests of
judicial economy. We discern no basis for this
request; it is denied.
AFFIRMED
GAJARSA, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
I respectfully dissent from the court's opinion.
There is no legal basis for the granting of a preliminary
injunction, and its issuance is an abuse of discretion.
Although generally the denial or issuance of a preliminary
injunction is within the broad discretion of the district
court, the decision of the district court must be reversed
when it abuses its discretion. See Cybor Corp. v.
FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1460
(Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc ) (A district court abuses its
discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous
findings of fact, is based on erroneous interpretations
of the law, or is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or
fanciful.).
A preliminary injunction requires the movant to
show four factors: (1) a reasonable likelihood of success
on the merits, (2) the prospect of irreparable harm, (3) a
balance of the parties' hardships in favor of injunction,
and (4) no potential injury to an important public interest.
See Jeneric/Pentron, Inc. v. Dillon Co., 205
F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2000). When the district court
considers the four factors, the likelihood of success
factor plays a key role, id., and that is the factor I will
focus on in my dissent. Because of the extraordinary
nature of the relief, the patentee carries the burden of
showing likelihood of success on the merits, in light of
the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial,
with respect to the patent's validity, enforceability, and
infringement. Nutrition 21 v. United States, 930 F.2d

merit, the preliminary injunction should not issue.
Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1350-51. This court has explained
that:
In resisting a preliminary injunction, however, one
need not make out a case *1372 of actual invalidity.
Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction
stages, while validity is the issue at trial. The showing
of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires
less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary
to establish invalidity itself.
Abbott Labs. v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 452 F.3d
1331, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2006) (herein  Andrx ) (quoting
Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1359).
The majority opinion postulates that the findings of
the district court are correct. It is error to so conclude
because the district court failed to properly consider and
weigh the ample evidence produced by Sandoz that
clearly established a substantial question of invalidity
and rendered the patent vulnerable to an invalidity challenge
at trial. Instead, the district court erroneously required
proof of clear and convincing evidence of invalidity
at the preliminary stages of the proceedings. As
I explain below, this conflicts with our clearly established
precedent.
Under our precedent, the likelihood of success
factor is properly analyzed by considering whether the
alleged infringer raises a substantial question as to
validity. See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v.
MacDermid Printing Solutions, L.L.C., 525 F.3d 1353,
1358 (Fed.Cir.2008) ([I]f the accused infringer raises a
substantial question regarding validity, the district court
should find that the patentee has not shown a likelihood
of success on the merits. (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Indeed, this court has consistently held that
an alleged infringer can negate the patentee's likelihood
of success on the merits-and thus defeat a preliminary
injunction-by raising a substantial question as to validity.
For example, in Genentech, this court explained:
In order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success,
[the patentee] must show that, in light of the
presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on
the merits, (1) it will likely prove that [the alleged infringer]
infringes the [ ] patent and (2) its infringement
claim will likely withstand [the alleged infringer's]
challenges to the validity and enforceability
of the [ ] patent. In other words, if [the alleged infringer]
raises a substantial question concerning
validity, enforceability, or infringement (i.e., asserts a
defense that [the patentee] cannot show lacks substantial
merit) the preliminary injunction should not
issue. More specifically, with regard to [the alleged
infringer's] validity defenses, the question on appeal
is whether there is substantial merit to [the alleged infringer's]
assertion that the [ ] patent claim [is invalid].
Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 108 F.3d
1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir.1997). Our subsequent cases consistently
applied the law as it was explained in Genentech.
See, e.g., Tate Access Floors v. Interface Architectural
Res., 279 F.3d 1357, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2002) (In
order to demonstrate likely success on the merits, [the
patentee] must show that, in light of the presumptions
and burdens applicable at trial, it will likely prove that
[the alleged infringer] infringes the asserted claims of
the [ ] patent and that the patent will likely withstand
[the alleged infringer's] challenges to its validity. If [the
alleged infringer] raises a substantial question concerning
infringement or validity, meaning that it asserts a
defense that [the patentee] cannot prove lacks substantial
merit, the preliminary injunction issued improperly.
(internal citations omitted; citing Genentech, 108
F.3d at 1364 and Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at 1350-51)).
Our most recent cases continue to adhere to the law
as it was explained in Genentech. See, e.g., *1373Erico
Int'l Corp. v. Vutec Corp., 516 F.3d 1350, 1352, 1354
(Fed.Cir.2008) (stating that [the alleged infringer]
must show a substantial question of invalidity to avoid a
showing of likelihood of success and vacating the preliminary
injunction [b]ecause this court finds that [the
alleged infringer] has raised a substantial question as to
the validity of the patent at issue); PHG Techs., LLC v.

injunction on grounds of potential invalidity, [the alleged
infringer], as the party bearing the burden of
proof on the issue at trial, must establish a substantial
question of invalidity and holding the district court
clearly erred in finding the patentee was likely to succeed
because [the alleged infringer] has satisfied its
burden of raising a substantial question of invalidity).
Thus, under our clearly established precedent, when the
alleged infringer raises a substantial question regarding
validity, a preliminary injunction cannot issue because
the patentee has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of
success on the merits.
While Section VI of the opinion contains a superfluity
of citations, it does not state the law relevant to
this case. It is a pleasant, ambulatory, and meandering
discussion; but it is not required to decide this case, is
not part of the majority opinion, and is clearly dicta. Although
Section VI discusses the relevant four-factor test
and properly emphasizes the likelihood of success
factor, it ignores the way this court has consistently analyzed
whether or not a patentee has demonstrated it will
likely succeed at trial. The real question before us in
this case, as our precedent clearly explains, is whether
the district court erred in finding that Sandoz had not
established a substantial question as to the obviousness
of the '718 patent. See, e.g., Genentech, 108 F.3d at
1364 ([T]he question on appeal is whether there is substantial
merit to [the alleged infringer's] assertion that
the [ ] patent claim [is invalid].). Sandoz has, in fact,
raised and substantially established that the validity of
the '718 patent is vulnerable, and on the record before
us, Abbott failed to prove the invalidity defense lacks
substantial merit. See Amazon.com, 239 F.3d at
1350-51 (If [the alleged infringer] raises a substantial
question concerning either infringement or validity, i.e.,
asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the
patentee cannot prove lacks substantial merit, the preliminary
injunction should not issue.). Thus, the district
court committed reversible error when it analyzed
the likelihood of success factor and determined that Abbott
had established it would likely succeed on the merits.
In light of that error, I would vacate the preliminary
injunction and remand for reconsideration and reweighing
of the injunctive factors. Moreover, various addi
tional legal errors taint the district court's decision.
I.
The district court's grant of a preliminary injunction
rested on only two claims, claims 1 and 4 of the '718
patent. Claim 1 reads:
a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of
an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment,
comprising
an erythromycin derivative and
from about 5[%] to about 50% by weight of a phar
FN1
maceutically acceptable polymer [ ], so that when
ingested orally, *1374 the composition induces statistically
significantly lower mean fluctuation index
[DFL] in the plasma than an immediate release composition
of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining
bioavailability substantially equivalent to that
of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin
derivative.
FN1. The specification of the '718 patent
states, in a list of definitions, that   pharmaceutically
acceptable as used herein, means
those compounds which are, within the scope
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in
contact with the tissues of humans and lower
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic
response, and the like, in keeping with a
reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for
their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis
of antimicrobial infections. In my
judgment the district court's claim construction
is ambiguous as to whether the pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer must extend release or
whether it can be part of a matrix in which other
components extend the release. Sandoz is
correct that there needs to be some showing
that the polymer acts to extend release.
'718 Patent, col.11 ll.28-38. Claim 4 similarly
claims an erythromycin derivative and from about
5[%] to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer but has different PK parameters.

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
Id. col. 11 ll.48-58. Claim 2 and claim 3 are dependant
claims of claim 1. Claim 2 claims the pharmaceutical
composition of claim 1, wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic
water-soluble polymer. Id. col.11 ll.39-40.
Claim 3 claims the pharmaceutical composition of
claim 2, wherein the polymer is selected from the group
consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose,
vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers, methacrylic
acid copolymers, maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl ether
copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof. Id.
col. 11 ll.41-47.
Claims 1 and 4 of the '718 patent have three basic
limitations: (a) an erythromycin derivative; (b) 5% to
50% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer;
and (c) various PK parameters. In the preferred
embodiment, the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin
and the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is
HPMC at 10% to 30% by weight of the composition.
Claim 4 requires PK parameters be such that upon oral
ingestion, maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin
derivative are lower than those produced by an
immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and
[AUC] and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially
equivalent to that of the immediate release
pharmaceutical composition. Id. col.11 ll.52-58. Claim
1 achieves similar results with slightly different parameters.
For claim 1, the composition must have a
statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index,
DFL, which is defined in the specification as DFL
=(C-C/C), id. col.3 ll.29-30, and substan
max min Av

found meant that the [ER] AUC values must be

FN2. These figures are based on FDA definitions.
II.
Sandoz based its obviousness arguments primarily
on three prior art references, which it argues combined
with common sense and the ordinary skill of the art at
the time make the '718 patent anticipated or obvious.
First, Sandoz argues that the PTC Application WO
95/30422 (the '422 publication) filed by Pfizer, discloses
a controlled release dosage form of azithromycin,
which like clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative.
FN3
According to the disclosure, these controlled released
compositions operate to release the drug substantially
slower than the immediate release*1375 versions
to reduce GI side effects. And, as Sandoz points out, the
controlled release compositions disclosed in the '422
publication include a hydrophilic polymer composition
of azithromycin, with a preferred embodiment being a
matrix tablet containing 15% to 35% HPMC. Second,
Sandoz noted that the '190 patent owned by Abbott discloses
and claims controlled release compositions of
clarithromycin in an (non-polymer) alginate matrix
which are administered once a day and have slowed absorption
such that they are bioequivalent with the current
immediate release twice-a-day compositions and
maintain therapeutic levels at 24 hours after ingestion.
Claim 14 of the '190 patent also claims other marolides
FN4
including azithromycin. Third, Sandoz argues that
the '571 publication, filed by Eli Lilly, discloses sustained
release formulations for antimicrobial agents including
clarithromycin, which contain an active agent,
namely a hydrophilic polymer such as HPMC, and an
acrylic polymer. According to the specification, these
formulations differ from the prior art that uses just hydrophilic
polymers in that they are designed to allow a
constant rate of release throughout the GI tract. In particular,
the '571 publication disclosed using from about
5% to about 29% by weight hydrophilic polymer, and
about 0.5% to about 25% by weight acrylic polymer,
with the total weight of the two polymers not exceeding
30% by weight.
FN3. Abbott specifically carved out azithromycin
from its definition of an erythromycin derivative
in the '718 patent. See Andrx, 452 F.3d
at 1337.
FN4. In Andrx, this court relied primarily on
the '190 patent, as combined with the '422 publication
to find that there was a substantial

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
question as to the obviousness of the '718 patent
claims. 452 F.3d at 1340-41. First, we concluded
that Teva makes substantial arguments
that the '190 patent discloses a clarithromycin
composition ... that arguably has the pharmacokinetic
parameters required in claim 4 of the
' 718 patent. Id. at 1340. And we explained:
Because the '190 patent explicitly discloses
only clarithromycin controlled release compositions,
yet claims azithromycin compositions,
... Abbott has represented to the [PTO]
that the differences between clarithromycin
and azithromycin were such that azithromycin
could be substituted into a controlled release
clarithromycin composition by a person
of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation....
As a result, based on Abbott's
own '190 patent, there exists a substantial
argument that a person of ordinary skill
in the art would be motivated to combine the
'422 publication, namely the use of HPMC in
extended release macrolide compositions,
with the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation
of success.
Id. at 1341. In this case, Abbott presented
evidence at trial suggesting that this court
was scientifically incorrect to find that the '
190 patent disclosed compounds that arguably
had the same PK values as the asserted
claims. Sandoz, based on this new evidence,
disclaimed any reliance on the scientific
evidence of the '190 patent disclosing compounds
with the same PK values as the '718
patent. However, contrary to the majority
opinion, Sandoz can rely on Andrx's conclusion
that it would have been obvious for a
person skilled in the art to substitute clarithromycin
for azithromycin in an extended release
formula with the anticipation of success
without undue experimentation.
In addition to challenging the validity of the '718
patent based on the '190 patent, the '422 publication and
the '571 publication, Sandoz also relies on various evid
ence that the PK parameters specified in the '718 patent
were well known in the art and would have been sought
by anyone designing a controlled release formulation.
Most strikingly, the testimony of one of the inventors
named on the '718 patent, Linda Gustavson, an Abbott
employee, supports the Sandoz position. In particular,
Gustavson testified as follows:
Q: Did you tell [the formulations department] what
pharmacokinetic parameters there should be?
A: I mean, not specific numbers, but relative to the
IR, yes. I told at least Sue that what we needed was
*1376 a lower Cmax, an AUC that met FDA requirements
for bioequivalence and a Cmin that was at least
comparable to the IR.
Q: And where did you get these parameters?
...
A: A few years of experience, I guess. They're the-I
mean certainly the Cmax and AUC are very basic PK
parameters determined in virtually every study that
has pharmacokinetics. Cmin [ ] might or might not be
important depending upon the drug you were talking
about and what part of the pharmacokinetics you
though might be associated with efficacy or safety.
For clarithromycin, there was some thought that keeping
the concentrations above some minimum level
might be at least in part important to maintaining effectiveness
efficacy.
Q: Would you say that these PK parameters were
pretty much known in the art?
A: Absolutely, yes.
Furthermore, Sandoz submitted references from
1983 (over a decade before the ' 718 application was
submitted), which explained, inter alia, that the
objectives and possible advantages of controlled release
dosage forms included maintain[ing] therapeutic
drug levels, reduc[ing] dosing frequency,
reduc[ing] fluctuations in drug levels, and reduc[ing]
side effects. And the reference explained that the
essence of controlled drug release was to obtain pro

(Cite as: 544 F.3d 1341)
longed circulating drug levels with less fluctuation compared
to conventional dosage forms, and to achieve
these with less frequent drug administration. They also
submitted references showing that HPMC was considered
the controlled release agent of choice in the
field.
The district court, writing prior to KSR, found that,
despite this Court's decision in Andrx to the contrary,
claims 1 and 4 of the '718 patent were not obvious (at
least based on the preliminary record). The trial court's
finding rested on the fact that, contrary to this court's
conclusion in Andrx, new evidence established that the '
190 patent, the '571 publication, and the WO '422 publication
did not disclose the specific PK limitations of
the '718 patent. The court recognized that [g]enerally,
a showing that there is an established structural relationship
between a prior art composition and the claimed
composition demonstrates a prima facie case of obviousness.
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 840. See In re
Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692 (Fed.Cir.1990) (en banc)
([S]tructural similarity between claimed and prior art
subject matter, proved by combining references or otherwise,
where the prior art gives reason or motivation to
make the claimed compositions, creates a prima facie
case of obviousness.). Still, the court concluded that
Abbott had preliminarily rebutted this showing by
showing the specific PK properties embodied in the
claims were unobvious. The trial court found that [t]o
succeed on its obvious[ness] claim, Sandoz must produce
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were
disclosed in the prior art or were at the very least inherent
to the structural limitations of the prior art compositions.
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 840. Sandoz, the
court found, had not done so. Id. Moreover, the trial
court found that because the '190 prior art does not disclose
the [specific] PK profile of the '718 patent, a person
skilled in the art would not be motivated to look at
the WO '422 publication and interchange clarithromycin
for azithromycin. Id. at 841.
Subsequently, the district court denied Sandoz's
motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending
appellate review in light of the just issued KSR opinion.
The court held that under KSR it was still *1377 neces
sary to demonstrate the presence of all claim limitations
in the prior art and that Sandoz had not produced
evidence indicating that the PK limitations were disclosed
in the prior art or inherent to the structural limitations
of the prior art compositions. Abbott Labs. v.
Sandoz, 500 F.Supp.2d 846, 851-53 (N.D.Ill.2007). According
to the district court, it thus had not and did not
need to reach the TSM test (or any change in the application
of this test brought on by KSR). Id. at 853.
On appeal, there is no real dispute that the '571
publication expressly discloses a sustained release
matrix formulation in tablet form comprising ... erythromycin
and containing from about 5% by weight to
about 29% by weight of a hydrophilic polymer, thus
meeting all of the structural limitations of the ' 718
claims. Moreover, the prior art clearly disclosed sustained
release versions of clarithromycin and creating
extended release formulations of erythromycin derivatives
using polymers, preferably HPMC. And evidence
shows that the desirability of the PK parameters claimed
were well known in the art.
In light of this evidence, Sandoz raised a substantial
question as to the obviousness of the '718 patent. The
district court's decision to the contrary constituted an
abuse of discretion. First, it was clearly error to find, as
a matter of law, that since none of the prior art references
cited by Sandoz explicitly disclosed a composition
that had the PK limitations of the ' 718 patent, it
had failed to demonstrate the presence of all claim limitations
in the prior art, and therefore that the '718 invention
could not be obvious. Contrary to the majority,
this holding relies on an improperly limited view of
what types of references can be combined to show obviousness
and an impermissibly cramped view of the Supreme
Court's holding in KSR. There is no absolute requirement
that each claim limitation be disclosed in a
prior art reference. See, e.g., Takeda Chem. Indus. v. Alphapharm
Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1356
(Fed.Cir.2007) (We have held that structural similarity
between claimed and prior art subject matter, proved by
combining references or otherwise, where the prior art
gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions,
creates a prima facie case of obviousness.

Inc., 257 F.3d 1331, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2001)
(acknowledging that a claim could be obvious over a
single prior art reference that does not disclose one of
the limitations in the claim). Rather, in all cases, the
touchstone of the analysis is whether the differences
between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole
would have been obvious at the time the invention was
made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to
which said subject matter pertains. 35 U.S.C.  103;
KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct.
1727, 1734, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007); see also Takeda,
492 F.3d at 1357 (explaining that in cases involving
new chemical compounds to show a prima facie case
of obviousness one must identify some reason that
would have led a chemist to modify a known compound
in a particular manner (emphasis added)). Thus, a given
claim limitation may be obvious over the prior art
even if no single reference had specifically disclosed
that limitation. Moreover, even assuming an absolute
rule that to be obvious a claim must be a combination of
elements disclosed in the prior art, that standard was
met here. As the Supreme Court reiterated in KSR,
inventions in most, if not all, instances rely upon
building blocks long since uncovered, and claimed discoveries
almost of necessity will be combinations of
what, in some sense, is already known. 127 S.Ct. at
1741. In other words, it is the rare invention that is not a
FN5
*1378 combination of prior art elements.And this
is not one of such rare cases. Whether or not the prior
art disclosed compounds displaying the particular PK
parameters in the ' 718 patent, Sandoz did provide evidence
suggesting that the PK parameters disclosed in the
'718 patent were absolutely known in the art and that
the prior art established that they were desirable in an
extended release formula (and indeed, that at least the
AUC equivalence and lower Cmax were most likely essential
to an extended release formula, at least one that
would be approved by the FDA). This is sufficient to
show that the claims might be a combination of elements
previously known in the art. The prior art on record
disclosing the PK limitations is of course further
removed from the invention than, for example, a patent
that disclosed a related drug formulation with the same
PK limitations as the '718 patent. But while this may
well make the former less likely than the latter to make
the '718 patent claims obvious, there is nothing as a
matter of law that prevents the invention from being
considered an obvious combination of the prior art
teachings contained in the current preliminary record.
Cf. Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd.,
499 F.3d 1293, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2007) (explaining that
while it is necessary for there to be some articulated
reasoning with some rational underpinning to support
the legal conclusion of obviousness ... such reasoning
need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific
subject matter of the challenged claim (internal
FN6
quotation marks omitted)).
FN5. Given KSR's broad understanding of
nearly all or perhaps all inventions being combinations
of elements in the prior art, the
parties' dispute about whether KSR should be
limited to such inventions becomes largely irrelevant.
In any event, while KSR's holding is
directed particularly at the TSM test, it certainly
appears that the Court intended to expound
principles of obviousness jurisprudence
that were generally applicable. And particularly
relevant to the case at bar, this court has
already applied KSR's teachings to the question
of whether new chemical compositions are obvious
in light of the fact that chemists of ordinary
skill would attempt to modify known substances
in certain ways to obtain compounds
with improved properties. Takeda, 492 F.3d at
1356. Accordingly, I think the district court
clearly erred in concluding that KSR was not
relevant to the question of obviousness here.
FN6. See also Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480
F.3d 1348, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2007) ([It] is irrelevant

none of the anions specifically listed in the '909
patent have a cyclic structure, because the motivation
to make amlodipine besylate here is

amlodipine maleate tablet formulations sought
to be solved by the inventors of the '303 patent.).
Second, it is not dispositive that Abbott was not absolutely
certain that using the formulations disclosed in
the '422 patent would create a formulation with the desired
PK parameters. Even before KSR, this court's
case law [was] clear that obviousness cannot be
avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability
in the art so long as there was a reasonable
probability of success. Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364. And
as the Supreme Court stated in KSR, [w]hen there is a
design need or market pressure to solve a problem and
there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions,
a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue
the known options within his or her technical grasp.
If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the
product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common
sense. 127 S.Ct. at 1742 (One of the ways in
which a patent's subject matter can be proved obvious is
by noting that there existed at the time of invention a
known problem for which there was an obvious solution
encompassed by the patent claims.).

42 C.C.P.A. 824, 220 F.2d 454, 456 (1955)). Accordingly,
in Pfizer, for example, the court found that the
optimization of a pharmaceutical compound to determine
which acid salt was best was obvious, where the
prior art heavily suggests the particular anion used to
form the salt. Id. Similarly, here, if the PK parameters
claimed were well known, and only routine experimentation
by someone skilled in the art would have been necessary,
in light of the HPMC formulations disclosed by
the '422 publication and '571 publication, to create an
ER clarithromycin-HPMC formulation with the claimed
PK parameters, this would be sufficient to create a
prima facie case of obviousness.
Accordingly, the district court erred in concluding
that the fact that the ' 422 publication and '190 patent
did not disclose the PK limitations of the asserted
claims precluded a finding of obviousness. This legal
error constitutes an abuse of discretion. And contrary to
the holding of the district court, Sandoz has raised a
substantial question concerning the obviousness of
the asserted claims. On this basis, I would reverse the
decision of the district court.
III.
Sandoz also argues that several acts by Abbott during
the prosecution of its patent application constitute
inequitable conduct and, thus, show that the district
court abused its discretion in not rejecting the motion
for a preliminary injunction based on the likelihood that
the patents would be declared unenforceable.
The Patent Examiner initially rejected the claims of
the '718 application and requested that Abbott show that
one of its prior art compositions of clarithromycin,
which was described as an immediate release pediatric
suspension formula, did not have the same extended release
properties as Abbott's claimed invention. In response,
Abbott submitted a declaration by Linda Gustavson
stating that the Cof the ER clarithromycin
max
is statistically significantly lower than that for IR formulation
given twice daily. J.A. 10015. Abbott now
admits that this statement was incorrect-that the data
Gustavson relied on did not show a statistically significant
lowering of the C-but only a non-statistically
max
significant apparent lowering, and Gustavson herself
admits that she never performed any statistical analysis
of the data and would not have known how to do it.
The district court found that the concededly false
statement was immaterial since all the Examiner asked
was whether the two products have the same PK properties.
According to the district court, [g]iven the accuracy
of the ultimate conclusion-that the extended release
formulation was indeed different from the immediate
release suspension formulation, Gustavson's declaration
of a statistically significantly lower Cmax is immaterial
despite the fact that it satisfies the definition of
material provided by 37 C.F.R.  1.56(b). Sandoz I,
500 F.Supp.2d at 822. The district court reasoned that

despite meeting the standard for materiality of  1.56(b)
a reasonable examiner would not have considered the
statement important. Moreover, the district court emphasized
that no claim of the '718 patent requires the
extended release formulation to have a statistically significant
lower C than the immediate release formu
max
lation.
*1380 The Gustavson statement was material, or
more to the point, there is substantial likelihood that
Sandoz would be able to so establish at the merits stage.
First, contrary to the erroneous conclusion of the district
court, we have held that all misstatements or admissions
that satisfy [37 C.F.R.  1.56(b) ] are considered
material. Monsanto Co. v. Bayer Bioscience N.V., 514
F.3d 1229, 1237 n. 11 (Fed.Cir.2008). In addition, while
no claim element in the '718 patent specifically states
that the C value must be statistically significantly
max
lower, it does require Cvalues that are lower than
max
in the immediate release formulation. Despite the fact
that in other claim elements Abbott uses the term
statistically significantly lower, it is far from clear
that one can establish that the C value is lower if
max
the data does not show a statistically significant difference,
which by definition, as ordinarily understood,
means that the data cannot conclusively establish that
there is a real difference. This court previously recognized
that there is little in the ['718] patent itself that
establishes the differences (if any) between parameters
that are simply lower rather than statistically significantly
lower.  Andrx, 452 F.3d at 1339 n. 4. Moreover,
regardless of the claim construction, it would be important
(if not dispositive) to a reasonable examiner to know
that Abbott did not have data which showed a lower C
to any statistical significance over the structurally
max
similar prior art suspension formulas in deciding whether
to allow the claim over this prior art.
On this basis alone, the district court abused its discretion
because it created such a high bar for materiality
that in essence no statement or withholding of information
would be material if it would not change the ultimate
outcome of allowing the patent. This is inconsistent
with our precedent. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche,
Inc. v. Promega Corp., 323 F.3d 1354, 1368
(Fed.Cir.2003) (The fact that the examiner did not
have to rely on the purity representations in issuing the
patent is not inconsistent with a finding of materiality.
Although the inventors' statements regarding purity
were not the principal focus of the office action response,
they were clearly an important aspect of it. Under
the circumstances, a reasonable examiner would
have wanted to know that the patentability argument
based on purity was unsupported by the experimental
results cited by the inventors. (internal citation omitted));
Merck & Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 873
F.2d 1418, 1421 (Fed.Cir.1989) (rejecting a but for
standard of materiality).
In addition, while the district court did not reach
the issue of intent, the fact that Gustavson submitted a
declaration to the PTO in which she claimed to have
found a statistically significant lowering of Cdes
max
pite now admitting to never having done any statistical
analysis is sufficient circumstantial evidence of intent to
raise a substantial question of inequitable conduct, if
not necessarily to prove inequitable conduct on the merits.
The district court also found that the failure by Ab
FN7
bott to disclose a new study *1381 was immaterial
because Abbott simply chose to rely on the results of
several other studies that showed differing mean DFL
values and the totality of the evidence demonstrates
that the prior art formulation did not have the same
broad PK properties as those claimed for the ER formulation.
Sandoz I, 500 F.Supp.2d at 824. The test is not
whether the Examiner would have refused to allow the
patent to issue without the information, but just whether
it would have been important to her consideration.
Here the extent the PK parameters of the ER formulation
differed from the clarithromycin formulations in
the prior art was the primary focus of the examiner's
concerns regarding patentability, and Abbott's ability to
establish sufficient differences was the basis for allowing
the claims. It was not for Abbott to decide unilaterally
that it preferred the results of one set of studies that
supported patentability and therefore could ignore studies
reaching the opposite result. Cf. Paragon Podiatry
Lab. v. KLM Labs., 984 F.2d 1182, 1193 (Fed.Cir.1993)

(finding inequitable conduct for failure to disclose sales
data and noting that where the decision of whether or
not to disclose sales before the critical date is close, the
case should be resolved by disclosure, not by the applicant's
unilateral decision.).
FN7. The written description of the '718 patent
states that The mean DFL values for the controlled
release formulation [another Abbott prior
art reference disclosing a clarithromycin formulation]
and for the IR are substantially equal
in value.... '718 Patent, col.11 ll.18-19. And it
explains that lower DFL values for the ER formulation
of the '718 patent show that it
provides less variable clarithromycin concentrations
throughout the day than the IR and the
sustained release compositions. ' 718 Patent,
col.11 ll.25-26. These statements were correct
based on three studies that had been done prior
to filing the application. However, a new study
W98-268, which Gustavson had knowledge of,
and which issued while the application was
pending, found that there was a statistically
significant lower DFL value for the sustained
release formulas than the IR formulas. Gustavson,
however, failed to disclose the results of
this new study.
Accordingly, I would also vacate the preliminary
injunction based on the allegations of inequitable conduct.
The evidence raises a substantial question of unenforceability
that makes the patents vulnerable to being
found unenforceable at trial. Thus, the district court
erred when it concluded that Abbott had shown it would
likely succeed on the merits.
Because of the reasons stated above, I would reverse
the district court on the basis that there are substantial
questions of both validity and enforceability of
the '718 patent preventing a finding of likelihood of
success on the merits.
