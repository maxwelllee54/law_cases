QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
BROADCOM CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
Nos. 2007-1545, 2008-1162.
Dec. 1, 2008.
Background: Patent owner filed action against
competitor alleging infringement of patents relating
to video compression technology. The United
States District Court for the Southern District of
California, Rudi M. Brewster, Senior District
Judge, 2007 WL 2261799, granted judgment for
competitor. Owner appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) owner had been required to disclose its patents
to joint video team (JVT) standard setting organization
(SSO) even if it did not submit technical proposal;
(2) JVT intellectual property right (IPR) policies,
that referred to IPR information associated with
any standardization proposal or affecting the use
of JVT work, required JVT participants to disclose
patents that reasonably might be necessary to
practice JVT standard;
(3) clear and convincing evidence existed that patents
in suit relating to video compression technology
reasonably might be necessary to practice
standard for video compression;
(4) implied waiver could be applied to owner's intentional
organization of plan to shield its patents
from consideration by JVT in face of duty to speak;
(5) competitor could assert equitable estoppel defense
on appeal even if its pleadings may have been
deficient in certain respects;
(6) scope of remedy of unenforceability had to be
limited to products that were complaint to video
compression standard; and
(7) litigation misconduct was sufficient standing
alone to support exceptional case determination.
Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

PROST, Circuit Judge.
This patent infringement case involves the consequence
of silence in the face of a duty to disclose
patents in a standards-setting organization (SSO).
The district court concluded that Qualcomm
breached its duty to disclose U.S. Patent Nos.
5,452,104 ('104 Patent) and 5,576,767 ('767 Patent)
to the Joint Video Team (JVT) SSO. As a
remedy, the district court ordered the '104 and '767
Patents (and related patents) unenforceable against
the world. Additionally, based on both Qualcomm's
JVT misconduct and its litigation misconduct, the
court determined that this was an exceptional case
and awarded Broadcom its attorney fees. For the
reasons set forth below, we affirm the district
court's determinations that Qualcomm had a duty to
disclose the asserted patents to the JVT, that it
breached this duty, and that the JVT misconduct
and litigation misconduct were proper bases for the
court's exceptional case determination. Because the
scope of the remedy of unenforceability as applying
to the world was too broad, however, we vacate the
unenforceability judgment and remand with instructions
to enter an unenforceability remedy limited in
scope to H.264-compliant products. Accordingly,
we affirm-in-part (duty to disclose, breach of duty,
exceptional case determination), vacate-in-part
(unenforceability scope), and remand.
I. BACKGROUND
This case presents the question of whether
Qualcomm waived its right to assert its patents by
failing to disclose them to the JVT SSO. The asserted
patents relate to video compression technology.
The '104 Patent issued in 1995 and is entitled,
Adaptive Block Size Image Compression Method
and System. The ' 767 Patent issued in 1996 and is
entitled, Interframe Video Encoding and Decoding
System. Chong U. Lee, who was the Vice President
of Technology at Qualcomm at the time of this
litigation, is the named inventor of the '104 Patent,
and he and Donald Pian are the named inventors of

the '767 Patent. Qualcomm is the assignee of the
'104 and '767 Patents.
In late 2001, the JVT was established as a joint
project by two parent SSOs: (1) the Video Coding
Experts Group (VCEG) of the International Telecommunication
Union Telecommunication Standardization
Sector (ITU-T); and (2) the Moving
Picture Experts Group (MPEG) of the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and
the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC). The JVT was created to develop a single
technically aligned, fully interoperable industry
standard for video compression technology. Qualcomm
Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., 539 F.Supp.2d
1214, 1218 (S.D.Cal.2007) ( Remedy Order )
(quoting JVT Terms of Reference (ToR)). The
standard developed by the JVT was later named the
H.264 standard. In May 2003, the ITU-T and ISO/
IEC adopted and published the official H.264
standard.
*1009 Plaintiff Qualcomm is a member of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
which is the United States representative member
body in the ISO/IEC, and was an active dues-
paying member for many years prior to 2001. It is
also a member of the ITU-T and a participant in the
JVT. Qualcomm did not disclose the '104 and '767
Patents to the JVT prior to release of the H.264
standard in May 2003.
On October 14, 2005, Qualcomm filed the
present lawsuit against Broadcom in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of
California, claiming that Broadcom infringed the
'104 and '767 Patents by making products compliant
with the H.264 video compression standard. A jury
trial was held from January 9, 2007, to January 26,
2007. The jury returned a unanimous verdict as to
non-infringement and validity, finding that (1)
Broadcom does not infringe the '104 and '767 Patents;
and (2) the '104 and '767 Patents were not
shown to be invalid. The jury also returned a unanimous
advisory verdict as to the equitable issues,
finding by clear and convincing evidence that (1)
the '104 Patent is unenforceable due to inequitable
conduct; and (2) the '104 and '767 Patents are unenforceable
due to waiver.
On March 21, 2007, the district court entered
an order (1) finding in favor of Qualcomm and
against Broadcom on Broadcom's counterclaim of
inequitable conduct as to the '104 Patent; (2) finding
in favor of Broadcom and against Qualcomm on
Broadcom's affirmative defense of waiver as to the
'104 and '767 Patents; and (3) setting a hearing on
an Order to Show Cause as to the appropriate remedy
for Qualcomm's waiver. The district court's
conclusion that Qualcomm waived its rights to assert
the '104 and '767 Patents was based on Qualcomm's
conduct before the JVT.
Throughout discovery, motions practice, trial,
and even post-trial, Qualcomm adamantly maintained
that it did not participate in the JVT during
development of the H.264 standard. Despite numerous
requests for production and interrogatories requesting
documents relating to Qualcomm's JVT
participation prior to adoption of the H.264 standard,
Qualcomm repeatedly represented to the court
that it had no such documents or emails. On January
24, 2007, however, one of the last days of trial,
a Qualcomm witness testified that she had emails
that Qualcomm previously claimed did not exist.
Later that day, Qualcomm produced twenty-one
emails belonging to that witness. As the district
court later discovered, these emails were just the
tip of the iceberg, as over two hundred thousand
more pages of emails and electronic documents
were produced post-trial. Remedy Order at 1245.
The district court later determined that these documents
and emails indisputably demonstrate that
Qualcomm participated in the JVT from as early as
January 2002, that Qualcomm witnesses ... and other
engineers were all aware of and a part of this
participation, and that Qualcomm knowingly attempted
in trial to continue the concealment of
evidence. Id.
On August 6, 2007, after a hearing on the Order
to Show Cause, the district court entered an Or

der on Remedy for Finding of Waiver, ordering the
'104 and ' 767 Patents (and their continuations, continuations-
in-part, divisions, reissues, and any other
derivatives thereof) unenforceable against the
world. The district court concluded:
In light of all of the ... evidence finally revealed,
the eventual collapse of Qualcomm's concealment
efforts exposes the carefully orchestrated plan
and the deadly determination of Qualcomm to
achieve its goal of holding hostage the entire industry
desiring to practice the *1010 H.264
standard by insulating its IPR from the JVT so
that the JVT would lose the opportunity to mitigate,
if not to avoid, Qualcomm's IPR in the development
of the H.264 standard. Broadcom, ignorant
of the existence of the '104 and '767 patents,
designed and is in the process of manufacturing
numerous H.264-compliant products.
Remedy Order at 1248.
On August 6, 2007, the district court also granted
Broadcom's exceptional case motion, finding
that this is an exceptional case by clear and convincing
evidence based on (1) Qualcomm's bad
faith participation in the H.264-standard-setting
body, the Joint Video Team (JVT); and (2) the litigation
misconduct of Qualcomm through its employees,
hired outside witnesses, and trial counsel
during discovery, motions practice, trial, and post-
trial proceedings. Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom
Corp., No. 05-CV-1958, 2007 WL 2261799, at *2,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57122, at *7 (S.D.Cal. Aug.
6, 2007) ( Exceptional Case Order ). In conjunction
with the exceptional case order, the district
court granted Broadcom its attorney fees.
On October 12, 2007, the magistrate judge held
a hearing to investigate Qualcomm's litigation misconduct.
As a sanction, the magistrate judge
ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom's attorney
fees, offset by any amount Qualcomm pays associated
with the exceptional case order. The magistrate
judge also referred six Qualcomm attorneys to the
California State Bar for investigation and possible
sanctions. The magistrate judge further ordered
Qualcomm and the sanctioned attorneys to participate
in a comprehensive Case Review and Enforcement
of Discovery Obligations (CREDO) program.
Qualcomm subsequently paid the sanction
and participated in the CREDO program. Thereafter,
the district court vacated the magistrate
judge's order as to the sanctioned attorneys and remanded
that portion of the order for further proceedings.

infringement judgment, we may dismiss
this appeal as moot, because it no longer
presents any case or controversy between
the parties. Appellee's Br. 1-2. As Qualcomm
responds, however, the district
court's judgment on waiver rendered the
asserted patents (and all related patents)
unenforceable against the world, which has
a broader scope than the judgment of non-
infringement as to the asserted claims and
the accused products in this case. Thus,
Qualcomm's failure to appeal the non-
infringement judgment does not moot its
appeal of the unenforceability judgment.

Inc. (In re Omeprazole Patent Litig.), 483
F.3d 1364, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2007) (stating
that an inequitable conduct claim was not
technically moot, because it would have
rendered the entire ... patent unenforceable,
rather than just the claims that were
held invalid).
II. DISCUSSION
By failing to disclose relevant intellectual
property rights (IPR) to an SSO prior to the adoption
of a standard, a patent holder is in a position
to hold up industry participants from implementing
the standard. Industry participants who have invested
significant resources developing products

and technologies that conform to the standard will
find it prohibitively expensive to abandon their investment
and switch to another standard. Broad-
com Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 310
(3d Cir.2007). In order to avoid patent hold-up,
many SSOs require participants to disclose and/or
give up IPR covering a standard. See Mark A. Lemley,
Intellectual Property Rights and Standard-Setting
Organizations, 90 Cal. L.Rev. 1889, 1902
(2002) (Because many SSOs want the public to be
free to use their standard, they will often require
members to give up any IP protection that covers
the standard.).
*1011 In Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Technologies
AG, this court considered the question of whether
the plaintiff, Rambus, had a duty to disclose information
about patents or patent applications to
the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council
(JEDEC), which is an SSO associated with the
Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA). 318 F.3d
1081, 1096 (Fed.Cir.2003). It stated that, [b]efore
determining whether Rambus withheld information
about patents or applications in the face of a duty to
disclose, this court first must ascertain what duty
Rambus owed JEDEC. Id. In determining what
duty, if any, Rambus owed JEDEC, our court considered
both the language of the written EIA/JEDEC
IPR policy and the members' treatment of said
language. Id. at 1098. It determined that the written
policy did not impose a direct duty on members expressly
requiring disclosure of IPR information. Id.
Nevertheless, because JEDEC members treated the
language of [the policy] as imposing a disclosure
duty, this court likewise treat[ed] this language as
imposing a disclosure duty. Id.
After considering evidence regarding the JEDEC
members' understanding of the JEDEC policy,
this court determined that Rambus's duty to disclose
extended only to claims in patents or applications
that reasonably might be necessary to practice
the standard. Id. at 1100. Applying that rationale
to the claims at issue and the evidence in the case,
it stated that [t]he record shows that Rambus's
claimed technology did not fall within the JEDEC
disclosure duty. Id. at 1104. Accordingly, this
court concluded that substantial evidence does not
support the jury's verdict that Rambus breached its
duties under the EIA/JEDEC policy. Id. at 1105.
In the present case, the district court considered
whether Qualcomm had a duty to disclose the '104
and '767 Patents to the JVT prior to the release of
the H.264 standard. The district court first analyzed
the written JVT IPR policies, and concluded that,
[s]imilar to Rambus, the JVT IPR Policy and
Guidelines provide no express requirement to disclose
patents unless a member submits a technical
proposal. Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom Corp., No.
05-CV-1958, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28211, at *34
(S.D.Cal. Mar. 21, 2007) ( Waiver Order ). The
court continued, [i]nstead, members/experts are
encouraged to disclose as soon as possible IPR information
(of their own or anyone else's) associated
with any standardization proposal (of their own or
anyone else's). Such information should be
provided on a best effort basis.  Id. (quoting JVT
ToR subsection 3.2). The district court next considered
the JVT participants' treatment of the JVT
IPR policies. The district court stated that,
[s]imilar to Rambus, despite the language of the
IPR Policy merely encouraging participants to disclose
patents to the JVT, the issue before the Court
is whether JVT participants treated the IPR policy
as imposing a duty of disclosure. Id. at *38. The
district court concluded, like Rambus, that JVT
members treated the JVT IPR policies as imposing
a duty of disclosure on participants apart from the
submission of technical proposals. In order to determine
whether Qualcomm breached its disclosure
duty, the district court considered whether the '104
and '767 Patents  reasonably might be necessary
to practice the H.264 standard. Finally, having concluded
that the asserted patents fell within the
reasonably might be necessary standard, the district
court determined that the proper remedy for
said breach was to order the patents unenforceable
against the world.

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321
(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
This appeal requires that we address the following
questions relating to the district court's
judgment: (1) Existence of Disclosure Duty: Did
Qualcomm, as a participant*1012 in the JVT, have
a duty to disclose patents to the JVT prior to the release
of the H.264 standard in May 2003; (2) Scope
of Disclosure Duty: If so, what was the scope of its
disclosure duty; (3) Breach: Did Qualcomm breach
its disclosure duty by failing to disclose the ' 104
and '767 Patents; and (4) Remedy: If so, was it
within the district court's equitable authority to
enter an unenforceability remedy based on the
equitable defense of waiver in the SSO context?
A. Existence of Disclosure Duty
1. Standard of Review
[2][3] We review questions of law de novo,
Wang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Elecs. Am., Inc., 103
F.3d 1571, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1997), and factual findings
for clear error, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The existence
of a disclosure duty is a legal question with
factual underpinnings. See Rambus, 318 F.3d at
1087 n. 3 (stating that the existence of a disclosure
duty may well be a legal question with factual underpinnings).
In the present case, one such factual
underpinning is the JVT participants' understanding
of the meaning of the JVT IPR policies.
2. Written Policies
[4] Determining whether Qualcomm had a duty
to disclose the '104 and ' 767 Patents to the JVT involves
two questions. First, we must determine
whether the written JVT IPR policies impose any
disclosure obligations on participants (apart from
the submission of technical proposals). Second, to
the extent the written JVT IPR policies are ambiguous,
we must determine whether the JVT participants
understood the policies as imposing such
obligations.
The district court first considered the written
JVT IPR policies. Specifically, the district court
considered the JVT ToR, which encompass patent
FN2
and copyright IPR.As the district court noted,
the IPR *1013 disclosure provisions of the JVT IPR
policies apply to Qualcomm, as a member of the
ITU-T and participant in the JVT.
FN2. Section 3 of the JVT ToR is entitled
IPR Policy & Guidelines. J.A. 8175.
Subsection 3.1, entitled Basic IPR Principles,
states that the JVT has agreed to
the following basic principles regarding
IPR for the JVT codec:
The JVT codec should have a simple
royalty free baseline profile (both on
the encoder and decoder) in order to promote
the wide implementation and use
of the JVT codec. All implementations
should have such a common baseline
profile core, in order to allow minimal
interoperability among all JVT codecs.
The above requirement means that all
technology applied in the baseline profile
shall have no IPR, expired IPR, or
valid but royalty-fee-free IPR (according
to Box 2.1 or 2.2.1 of the JVT Patent
Disclosure form, as shown below).
Special, more advanced profiles of the
JVT standard may contain patents per
Box 2.2 of the JVT Patent Disclosure
form (reasonable terms and conditions).
J.A. 8176.
Subsection 3.2, entitled Collection of
IPR information during the standardization
process, reads:
According to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC
IPR policy, members/experts are encouraged
to disclose as soon as possible IPR
information (of their own or anyone
else's) associated with any standardization
proposal (of their own or anyone
else's). Such information should be
provided on a best effort basis.
For collecting such information, JVT has
decided to use it's [sic] own Patent Declaration
form-note that this is distinct

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 11
548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321
(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
from the ITU ISO IEC Patent Statement
and Licensing Declaration that is to be
submitted to the ISO Secretary General
and ITU TSB Director when the contributed
technology becomes part of the final
standard.
Therefore, JVT requires all technical
(algorithmic) proposals include the following:
Attached at the end of each technical
contribution, a fully filled-out JVT Patent
Disclosure form (as shown below).
At the contribution stage, this form is for
information only, and may be signed by
an expert or left unsigned. The form
must be included in the contribution to
JVT.
Additionally, all submitted source code
must include a written transfer of copyright
in the form described in section 5
below.
Note that the submission of the JVT Patent
Disclosure form at the proposal stage
does not have the same formal status as
the final IPR declaration to the ITU TSB
and ISO/IEC, which must be done in the
approval process for the ITU-T Recommendation
and ISO/IEC International
Standard.
Such information provided to the Chair
Rapporteur will be tabulated in a IPR
status list (e.g. a simple Word table) of
the information received. Information
not currently relevant (e.g. if a proposed
method was not accepted) will be removed
from the IPR status list as early
as possible. The IPR status list is a living
document of the JVT.
Id. (emphases removed).
As the district court observed, it is clear from a
review of the JVT IPR policies that identification of
IPR by JVT participants is critical to the development
of an effective industry standard. While more
advanced profiles of the JVT standard may include
patents on a reasonable terms and conditions basis,
the goal of the JVT was to develop a royalty free
baseline profile. See J.A. 8176 (The JVT codec
should have a simple royalty free baseline profile.).
The district court recognized that [t]he nondisclosure
of a participant's core patents in such a
program could put the participant in a position in
which it could literally block the use of the published
H.264 standard by any company unless the
company obtained a separate license from the participant.
Waiver Order at *60. As previously mentioned,
however, the district court determined that
the written JVT IPR policies provide no express
requirement to disclose patents unless a member
submits a technical proposal. Id. at *34.
On appeal, the threshold dispute between the
parties is whether the written JVT IPR policies impose
any disclosure duty on participants apart from
the submission of technical proposals. Qualcomm
argues that the written JVT IPR policies require
disclosure only when a technical proposal is made,
and that disclosure is merely encouraged from participants
not submitting technical proposals. Broad-
com, however, argues that the written policies of
both the JVT and its parent organizations impose
disclosure obligations on participants (apart from
the submission of technical proposals). Additionally,
Broadcom submits that, to the extent there is
any ambiguity in the written policies, the understanding
of the JVT participants controls.
One of the key inquiries regarding the meaning
of the written JVT IPR policies centers on the following
language of subsection 3.2 of the JVT ToR:
According to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC IPR policy,
members/experts are encouraged to disclose as
soon as possible IPR information (of their own or
anyone else's) associated with any standardization
proposal (of their own or anyone else's). Such information
should be provided on a best effort basis.

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
J.A. 8176 (emphases added). Pointing to subsection
3.2, Qualcomm argues that the express language
of the written JVT policies only requires disclosure
when a technical proposal is made, and that
disclosure is merely encouraged from participants
not making technical proposals. Thus, Qualcomm
argues that the district court erred in holding that
Qualcomm waived patent rights by breaching an
unwritten JVT disclosure duty. In addition to the
language of subsection 3.2, Qualcomm points to the
JVT patent disclosure form, which states: JVT requires
that all technical *1014 contributions be accompanied
with this form. Anyone with knowledge
of any patent affecting the use of JVT work, of
their own or any other entity (third parties'), is
strongly encouraged to submit this form as well.
J.A. 8179 (first, third, and fourth emphases added).
As Broadcom notes, however, subsection 3.2
expressly incorporates a best effort[s] standard.
Appellee's Br. 36; J.A. 8176 (stating that IPR
information should be provided on a best effort
basis). When asked at oral argument whether there
is any evidence in the record that Qualcomm made
any efforts, let alone best efforts, to disclose IPR
information associated with any standardization
proposal, Qualcomm responded, No, we didn't because
we did not view that as imposing a duty on
us. Oral Arg. at 9:27, available at http:// oralarguments.
cafc. uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3.
On rebuttal, Qualcomm clarified this response by
arguing that the use of best efforts is merely
encouraged, not required. See Oral Arg. at 35:09,
available at h ttp:// oralarguments.
cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2007-1545.mp3; see
also Appellant's Br. 25 (The use of best efforts to
identify essential patents, like the disclosure thereof,
is merely encouraged, not required.).
We disagree with Qualcomm's reading of subsection
3.2. While Qualcomm places much emphasis
on the use of the word encouraged in subsection
3.2, we agree with Broadcom that, when considered
in light of the relevant context, this language
applies to the timing of the disclosure (i.e.,
encouraged to disclose as soon as possible), not
the disclosure duty itself. Thus, while the language
of the JVT IPR policies may not expressly require
disclosure by all participants in all circumstances
(e.g., if relevant IPR is not disclosed despite the use
of best efforts), it at least incorporates a best efforts
standard (even apart from the submission of technical
proposals). By Qualcomm's own admission, it
did not present evidence of any efforts, much less
best efforts, to disclose patents associated with the
standardization proposal (of their own or anyone
else's) to the JVT prior to the release of the H.264
standard.
Moreover, in addition to the disclosure obligations
provided in the JVT IPR policies, Qualcomm
has disclosure obligations under the rules of the
JVT parent organizations. Subsection 3.2 of the
JVT IPR policies states that the JVT Patent Disclosure
form at the proposal stage does not have the
same formal status as the final IPR declaration to
the ITU TSB and ISO/IEC, which must be done in
the approval process for the ITU-T Recommendation
and ISO/IEC International Standard. J.A.
8176 (emphasis added). Broadcom submits that the
must be done language in subsection 3.2 is a
mandatory final approval process requiring all participants
to make disclosure prior to final approval
of the standard. Indeed, Broadcom claims that
Qualcomm made arguments to the trial court that
should preclude it from arguing on appeal that there
is not a must be done requirement. Specifically,
Broadcom asserts that, in the following argument to
the district court, Qualcomm conceded that JVT
participants had a duty to disclose patents to the
ISO/IEC and the ITU-T when a standard was approved:
There's also some requirement language down
here [in subsection 3.2 of the JVT policy] having
to do with-there's a must-be-done clause, must be
done in the approval process. So if you're participating
when a standard is approved, then you
have to submit a form to the parent bodies. But as
I mentioned a moment ago and as I'll get to later,

Qualcomm wasn't participating prior to approval,
so this language didn't apply.
*1015 J.A. 26421. We now know, however,
that Qualcomm actually was participating in the
JVT prior to approval of the H.264 standard. On appeal,
Qualcomm responds that its trial counsel
acknowledged that the must be done language is
mandatory but did not make any representations as
to the nature of the disclosure duty or what constitutes
the relevant participation in parent organizations.
Appellant's Reply Br. 8 n. 1. Qualcomm's
trial counsel clearly indicated, however, that its position
was, if you're participating when a standard
is approved, then you have to submit a form to the
parent bodies. J.A. 26421. We reject its contrary
arguments on appeal.
The rules of the JVT parent organizations
provide that an ITU-T and ISO/IEC Patent Statement
and Licensing Declaration should be submitted
separately to the ITU-T and ISO/IEC prior to final
approval of a standard created by the JVT. Remedy
Order at 1219. The ITU-T and ISO/IEC patent
policy provides that any party participating in the
work of the ITU, ISO or IEC should identify patents
embodied fully or partly in a standard under
consideration. Id. As the district court noted, this
language applies to Qualcomm as a party particip
FN3
ating in the work of the ITU, ISO or IEC. Id.
In light of the foregoing, we agree with the district
court that JVT participants also had to disclose patents
prior to final approval of a standard under the
FN4
rules of the JVT parent organizations.
FN3. Likewise, Broadcom argues that Section
2.14.2 of the ISO/IEC Directives applies
to Qualcomm. Oral Arg. at 24:30,
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc.
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3;
Appellee's Br. 38. Section 2.14.2(a) of the
ISO/IEC Directives states:
The originator of a proposal for a document
shall draw the attention of the committee
to any patent rights of which the
originator is aware and considers to cover
any item of the proposal. Any party
involved in the preparation of a document
shall draw the attention of the committee
to any patent rights of which it
becomes aware during any stage in the
development of the document.
J.A. 11892-93. Broadcom also points to
the ITU-T policy stating that the patent
holder has to provide a written statement
to be filed at the [Telecommunications
Standards Bureau] using the ITU-T
Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration
form. J.A. 11925; Appellee's Br.
38. At oral argument, Qualcomm argued,
however, that the ISO/IEC policy does
not impose any more of a duty than otherwise
would exist. Oral Arg. at 34:43,
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc.
uscourts. gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3.
FN4. Qualcomm notes that, while it did
not disclose the '104 and ' 767 Patents to
the JVT prior to adoption of the H.264
standard, it did disclose the technology
covered by the asserted patents to a different
project, the MPEG Digital Cinema
project, in late 2001. It also notes that
[t]he MPEG disclosure was reviewed by
[Gary] Sullivan, who subsequently chaired
the JVT. Appellant's Br. 45. As Broad-
com responds, however, Qualcomm cannot
argue that its disclosure to the Digital
Cinema project satisfies its disclosure duty
to the JVT. Additionally, Broadcom argues
that Qualcomm's disclosure to the Digital
Cinema project shows that there is no
doubt that Qualcomm knew how to disclose
these patents when it chose to disclose
them in the development of another
standard. We agree with Broadcom.
In sum, we conclude that Qualcomm, as a par
ticipant in the JVT prior to the release of the H.264
standard, did have IPR disclosure obligations, as

discussed above, under the written policies of both
the JVT and its parent organizations.
3. JVT Participants' Understanding of the JVT
IPR Policies
[5] Even if we were to read the written IPR
policies as not unambiguously requiring by themselves
the aforementioned disclosure obligations,
our conclusion as to the disclosure obligations of
JVT participants would nonetheless be the same.
That is because the language of the JVT *1016 IPR
policies coupled with the district court's unassailable
findings and conclusions as to the JVT participants'
understanding of the policies further establishes
that the policies imposed disclosure duties on
participants (apart from the submission of technical
proposals). As previously discussed, even though
the Rambus court determined that there was not an
express disclosure duty in the JEDEC patent policy
in that case, it treated the policy as imposing a disclosure
duty because the members treated it as imposing
a disclosure duty. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1098
.
In the present case, while the district court concluded
that there was no express disclosure requirement
in the written policies apart from the submission
of technical proposals, it found clear and convincing
evidence that JVT participants treated the
JVT IPR Policies as imposing a duty to disclose,
Waiver Order at *34, and that Qualcomm was
aware of this treatment as early as August 2002,
prior to the release of the H.264 standard in May
2003, Remedy Order at 1224. Specifically, the district
court noted that, like Rambus, in addition to
the written guidelines, JVT participants also
learned of the patent disclosure policy from attendance
of JVT meetings. Waiver Order at *34. The
district court considered witness testimony, including
testimony from Qualcomm employees, indicating
that it was the practice of the chairman of the
JVT, Gary Sullivan, to discuss the JVT IPR policies
at every meeting. The district court also considered
testimony indicating that JVT participants sometimes
submitted disclosures without an accompany
ing technical proposal.
Qualcomm attempts to distinguish Rambus by
arguing that the JEDEC patent policy in Rambus
was silent as to whether members had a disclosure
duty, while the written JVT IPR policies are
unambiguous, Appellant's Reply Br. 15, and
expressly specify disclosure duties only in conjunction
with a submission, Appellant's Br. 28.
Thus, Qualcomm argues that the district court erred
by inferring a disclosure duty that is directly contrary
to the written JVT policy. Appellant's Br. 26.
As previously discussed, however, we disagree with
Qualcomm's interpretation of the written JVT IPR
policies in the present case. Moreover, even if we
were to read the written IPR policies as not unambiguously
requiring by themselves the aforementioned
disclosure obligations, the disclosure duty
found by the district court based on the understanding
of the JVT participants is certainly not directly
contrary to the written JVT policy. Id.
Having rejected Qualcomm's argument that the
understanding of JVT participants is contrary to the
written JVT IPR policies, we are left with reviewing
the sufficiency of the district court's factual
finding that JVT participants understood the JVT
IPR policies as imposing a disclosure duty. Qualcomm
argues that the evidence relied upon by the
district court does not support its finding that the
JVT participants understood the JVT IPR policies
as imposing a disclosure duty. It asserts that Broad-
com offered no testimony of the other JVT participants
as to their understanding of the policy.
Broadcom responds that it offered, inter alia, the
testimony of Gary Sullivan (the JVT chair) and
Stephen Gordon (a JVT participant) indicating that
they understood the patent disclosure duty to be
mandatory. Qualcomm offers a different interpretation
of this testimony, as well as the testimony expressly
relied upon by the district court regarding
the discussion of the JVT IPR policies at every
meeting and the submission of disclosures without
accompanying technical proposals. We are not persuaded,
however, by Qualcomm's arguments that

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
the district court's findings lacked sufficient evidentiary
support, or that the evidence should be inter-
preted*1017 differently. The district court was in
the best position to determine the significance and
implications of the record testimony in the first instance,
and the cited testimony provides sufficient
FN5
evidentiary support for its findings.
FN5. Moreover, while we conclude that
the district court's findings on this point
were sufficiently supported by the record,
we agree with Broadcom that Qualcomm's
litigation misconduct in this case likely
prevented Broadcom from obtaining further
evidence regarding the understanding
of other JVT participants.
B. Scope of Disclosure Duty
[6] Having concluded that Qualcomm, as a participant
in the JVT prior to release of the H.264
standard, had a duty to disclose patents, we turn to
the question of the scope of the disclosure duty. In
Rambus, although the JEDEC IPR policy did not
use the language related to, the parties consistently
agreed that the policy required disclosure of
patents related to the standardization work of the
committee. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1098. The parties
disagreed, however, in their interpretation of
related to. Id. at 1099. The court considered evidence
regarding the JEDEC members' understanding
of the JEDEC policy, and concluded that Rambus's
duty to disclose extended only to claims in patents
or applications that reasonably might be necessary
to practice the standard. Id. at 1100. The court
reasoned that, [t]o hold otherwise would contradict
the record evidence and render the JEDEC disclosure
duty unbounded. Under such an amorphous
duty, any patent or application having a vague relationship
to the standard would have to be disclosed.
Id. at 1101. The court noted, [j]ust as lack
of compliance with a well-defined patent policy
would chill participation in open standard-setting
bodies, after-the-fact morphing of a vague, loosely
defined policy to capture actions not within the actual
scope of that policy likewise would chill participation
in open standard-setting bodies. Id. at
1102 n. 10.
In the present case, the district court noted that
the JVT IPR policies refer to IPR information
associated with any standardization proposal or
affecting the use of JVT work. Waiver Order at
*27 (citing JVT ToR). Applying the reasoning of
Rambus, the district court concluded that this language
requires only that JVT participants disclose
patents that reasonably might be necessary to
practice the H.264 standard. Id. To hold otherwise,
the district court explained, would render the JVT
disclosure duty inappropriately unbounded,
amorphous, and vague.  Id.
On appeal, Qualcomm argues that we should
reject the district court's formulation of the
reasonably might be necessary standard. Qualcomm
characterizes the reasonably might be necessary
formulation from Rambus as follows: it
must be reasonably clear at the time that the patent
or application would actually be necessary to practice
the standard. Appellant's Reply Br. 20
(emphasis removed) (citing Rambus, 318 F.3d at
1100). Thus, according to Qualcomm, when the
Rambus court explained the standard in terms of
whether the patent or application reasonably might
be necessary to practice the standard, the court
really meant that the patent or application must actually
be necessary to practice the standard. Id.
(emphasis added). Qualcomm submits that [i]t is
nonsensical to conceive that an SSO would require
disclosure to design a standard around a patent
when the standard does not read on the patent in the
first place. Id. at 21-22.
We disagree with Qualcomm's characterization
of the standard applied in Rambus. The plain language
used by the Rambus *1018 court
(reasonably might be necessary) contradicts
Qualcomm's claim that the Rambus formulation requires
that a patent must actually be necessary in
order to trigger a disclosure duty. The Rambus
court explained the reasonably might be necessary
standard by stating that the disclosure duty

operates when a reasonable competitor would not
expect to practice the standard without a license under
the undisclosed claims. Rambus, 318 F.3d at
1100-01. It further clarified that the reasonably
might be necessary standard is an objective standard,
which does not depend on a member's subjective
belief that its patents do or do not read on the
proposed standard. Id. at 1104. Likewise, in the
present case, we agree with the district court that
the language requires JVT participants to disclose
patents that reasonably might be necessary to
practice the H.264 standard. This is an objective
standard, which applies when a reasonable competitor
would not expect to practice the H.264 standard
without a license under the undisclosed claims.
This formulation does not require that the patents
ultimately must actually be necessary to practice
the H.264 standard.
C. Breach of Disclosure Duty
[7] Having concluded that the proper scope of
the disclosure duty requires JVT participants to disclose
patents that reasonably might be necessary
to practice the H.264 standard, we next address the
question of whether Qualcomm breached this disclosure
duty. It is undisputed that Qualcomm did
not disclose the '104 and '767 Patents to the JVT
prior to the release of the H.264 standard. Thus,
Qualcomm breached its disclosure duty if, as the
district court found by clear and convincing evidence,
the '104 and '767 Patents  reasonably might
be necessary to practice the H.264 standard.
As previously mentioned, the district court
found clear and convincing evidence that the '104
and '767 Patents  reasonably might be necessary
FN6
to practice the H.264 standard.In reaching this
conclusion, the district court relied on the testimony
from several Qualcomm witnesses. For example,
the district court relied on testimony from Qualcomm's
H.264 expert, who testified at trial that the
claims of the ['104] patent map onto the H.264
standard, so that devices or systems that practice
H.264 actually practice claims of the 104 patent.
Waiver Order at *41. Additionally, inter alia, the
district court relied on an email from a Qualcomm
employee discussing the coverage of the '767 Patent,
and describing it as a core patent relevant to
H.264. Id. at *42.
FN6. The district court refers to the standard
in terms of reasonably might be necessary,
reasonably may be necessary,
and reasonably may be essential. Compare
Waiver Order at *26 (reasonably
may be necessary), *27 (reasonably
might be necessary), and *40
(reasonably may be essential). We will
refer to the standard in the terms used by
the Rambus court, reasonably might be
necessary, for consistency.
Qualcomm argues that the finding of non-
infringement here refutes any finding that it
breached a disclosure duty. Broadcom responds,
however, that it is inconsistent for Qualcomm to
now argue that the asserted patents do not meet the
reasonably might be necessary standard, when
Qualcomm accused Broadcom's products of infringement
in this case solely because they practiced
the H.264 standard. Broadcom also points to
testimony of Qualcomm's own JVT participants in
support of its claim that JVT participants considered
that the asserted patents reasonably might
be necessary to practice the H.264 standard.
*1019 On appeal, Qualcomm does not present
any arguments comparing the asserted claims to the
H.264 standard in an attempt to show that they do
not meet the reasonably might be necessary formulation.
Indeed, Broadcom argues that if Qualcomm
truly believes that the asserted patents do not
meet the reasonably might be necessary standard,
then it necessarily lacked a Rule 11 basis to bring
this litigation in the first place. Appellee's Br. 48
(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (By presenting to the court
a pleading ... an attorney ... certifies that ... (2) the
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are
warranted by existing law ... [and] (3) the factual
contentions have evidentiary support....)).

548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321
(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
We are not persuaded by Qualcomm's arguments
on this point, and are unable to reconcile its
ex post argument that the asserted patents do not
meet the reasonably might be necessary standard
with its ex ante arguments regarding infringement.
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district
court did not err in finding clear and convincing
evidence that the '104 and ' 767 Patents fell
within the reasonably might be necessary standard.
Thus, the district court properly determined
that Qualcomm breached its disclosure duty by failing
to disclose the '104 and '767 Patents to the JVT
prior to the release of the H.264 standard in May
2003.
Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether
it was within the district court's equitable authority
to enter an unenforceability remedy in this case.
D. Equitable Remedies
[8] The district court analyzed the consequence
of Qualcomm's failure to disclose the '104 and '767
Patents under the framework of waiver as a consequence
of silence in the face of a duty to speak.
The parties disagree on whether waiver was the appropriate
equitable framework, and whether the
scope of the unenforceability remedy was within
the district court's equitable authority.
1. Standard of Review
[9][10] We review a district court's judgment
on the equitable defense of waiver for an abuse of
discretion. See A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides
Constr. Co., 960 F.2d 1020, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1992)
(en banc) (As equitable defenses, laches and equitable
estoppel are matters committed to the sound
discretion of the trial judge and the trial judge's decision
is reviewed by this court under the abuse of
discretion standard.). We review issues of law involved
in the district court's waiver judgment de
novo. See Wang Labs., 103 F.3d at 1581. As this
court has previously explained, we may set aside a
discretionary decision if the decision rests on an erroneous
interpretation of the law or on clearly erroneous
factual underpinnings. If such error is absent,
the determination can be overturned only if the trial
court's decision represents an unreasonable judgment
in weighing relevant factors. A.C. Aukerman,
960 F.2d at 1039.
2. Waiver
First, we address the question of whether
waiver was the appropriate equitable doctrine to apply
in this case. Qualcomm argues that the district
court's findings do not constitute waiver as a matter
of law. It argues that true waiver requires a voluntary
or intentional relinquishment of a known
right.
Specifically, Qualcomm claims that the district
court's findings in this case run directly contrary to
any claim that Qualcomm intended to voluntarily
waive its patent rights. On this point, we agree with
Qualcomm. The following finding by the district
court certainly suggests that *1020 Qualcomm did
not intend to waive its patent rights:
The Court FINDS by clear and convincing evidence
that Qualcomm intentionally organized a
plan of action to shield the '104 and '767 patents
from consideration by the JVT with the anticipation
that (1) the resulting H.264 standard would
infringe those patents and (2) Qualcomm would
then have an opportunity to be an indispensable
licensor to anyone in the world seeking to produce
an H.264-compliant product.
Remedy Order at 1227. Therefore, rather than
establishing that Qualcomm intentionally relinquished
its rights, the district court's findings
demonstrate that Qualcomm intentionally organized
a plan to shield its patents from consideration by
the JVT, intending to later obtain royalties from
H.264-compliant products. Thus, in these circumstances,
it appears that true waiver is not the appropriate
framework.
As Broadcom notes, however, the district
court's formulation of the law of waiver was not
limited to true waiver, but also addressed
implied waiver. Appellee's Br. 55. The district
court's advisory jury instruction stated:
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 18
548 F.3d 1004, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321
(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
In order to prove waiver, Broadcom must show
by clear and convincing evidence either that
Qualcomm, with full knowledge of the material
facts, intentionally relinquished its rights to enforce
the 104 and 767 patents or that its conduct
was so inconsistent with an intent to enforce its
rights as to induce a reasonable belief that such
right has been relinquished.
Waiver Order at *32-33 (emphasis added).
Broadcom submits that [t]he second element of
that instruction correctly states the long-established
doctrine of implied waiver. Appellee's Br. 55.
Qualcomm responds that [e]ven if a duty to
disclose had been breached, this breach is best explained
as negligence, oversight, or thoughtlessness,
which does not create a waiver. Appellant's
Br. 52 (quotations omitted). In the present case,
however, the district court found clear and convincing
evidence that Qualcomm knew that the asserted
patents reasonably might be necessary to
practice that H.264 standard, and that it intentionally
did not disclose them to the JVT. These findings
demonstrate much more than negligence,
oversight, or thoughtlessness.
As to implied waiver, Qualcomm argues that,
even if Broadcom had proven an intentional
breach of the JVT disclosure duty, waiver could be
inferred only if Qualcomm knew that nondisclosure
alone would (with no detrimental reliance by any
party) necessarily result in the loss of those rights.
Appellant's Br. 52. While Qualcomm argues that
implied waiver requires that a party have knowledge
that its actions would necessarily result in
the loss of rights, the case that Qualcomm cites as
support for this argument states that [w]here
waivers are permissible, they are often enforced
only if the waiver was knowing or intelligent,
which means the individual has sufficient awareness
of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences
of his decision. Clark v. Capital Credit
& Collection Servs., 460 F.3d 1162, 1170-71 (9th
Cir.2006) (quotations and citations omitted). The
Clark case also makes clear that waiver depends on
the right at issue. There was a different right at issue
in Clark, based on a different statutory scheme,
in a much different context than the present case.
Thus, we are not convinced that the Clark analysis
is particularly helpful here. Additionally, we note
that the district court's findings in the present case-
including that Qualcomm knew JVT participants
treated the JVT policies as imposing a duty, that it
knew the asserted patents reasonably might be
*1021 necessary to practice the H.264 standard,
and that it intentionally shielded the patents from
consideration by the JVT-demonstrate that Qualcomm
had sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances.
Moreover, even if Qualcomm did not
know that the asserted patents would necessarily
be held unenforceable as a result of a breach of its
disclosure duty, we conclude that alone would not
shield it from the application of implied waiver in
the SSO context where the district court found intentional
nondisclosure in the face of a duty to
FN7
speak.
FN7. Indeed, as previously mentioned,
here the district court found clear and convincing
evidence that
Qualcomm intentionally organized a
plan of action to shield the '104 and ' 767
patents from consideration by the JVT
with the anticipation that (1) the resulting
H.264 standard would infringe those
patents and (2) Qualcomm would then
have an opportunity to be an indispensable
licensor to anyone in the world
seeking to produce an H.264-compliant
product.
Remedy Order at 1227.
Qualcomm also argues that any nondisclosure
did not cause any harm to Broadcom or any other
entity. Appellant's Br. 55. Qualcomm submits that
there is no harm because (1) the jury's non-
infringement verdict conclusively establishes that
the asserted patents are not needed to produce
H.264-compliant products, and (2) even if the as

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
serted patents were needed to practice the H.264
standard, Qualcomm would be willing to license
them. Appellant's Br. 56. We disagree. Even if
Qualcomm agreed not to pursue an injunction in
this case, injunctions are not the only type of harm.
Forcing a party to accept a license and pay
whatever fee the licensor demands, or to undergo
the uncertainty and cost of litigation (which in this
case was substantial), are significant burdens.
Qualcomm further argues that [t]he district
court never found detrimental reliance by Broad-
com because of its misconception that such reliance
is not an element of a defense premised on conduct
that allegedly is objectively misleading to a reasonable
person. Appellant's Reply Br. 25. In essence,
it appears that Qualcomm wants to benefit from its
intentional nondisclosure of the asserted patents by
arguing that Broadcom cannot succeed on an implied
waiver defense without specific findings as to
detrimental reliance by Broadcom.
We disagree with Qualcomm's contention that
the district court's findings in this case were insufficient
to support the application of an implied
waiver defense. The district court found that JVT
participants understood the JVT IPR policies as imposing
a disclosure duty, that Qualcomm participated
in the JVT prior to release of the H.264 standard,
and that Qualcomm was silent in the face of its
disclosure duty. Indeed, the district court stated that
participants in the JVT project shared the aims and
policies of the JVT and considered themselves obligated
to identify IPR owned or known by them,
whether or not they made technical proposals for
study. Waiver Order at *60. As the district court
noted, Broadcom, ignorant of the existence of the
'104 and ' 767 patents, designed and is in the process
of manufacturing numerous H.264-compliant
products. Remedy Order at 1248. In light of the record
in this case in its entirety, it would be improper
to allow Qualcomm to rely on the effect of its
misconduct to shield it from the application of the
FN8
equitable defense of implied waiver.
FN8. We note that Qualcomm argues that
Broadcom's conception of waiver would
swallow the law of equitable estoppel.
Appellant's Reply Br. 24. While equitable
estoppel may generally be an appropriate
legal framework for analysis of breaches of
disclosure duties in the SSO context, as
Broadcom points out, that does not preclude
the same underlying conduct from
satisfying the defense of implied waiver.
As previously discussed, the district court's
findings in this case as to Qualcomm's intentional
nondisclosure in the face of a
duty to speak fully support the application
of implied waiver.
*1022 [11] In sum, we agree with the district
court that, [a] duty to speak can arise from a group
relationship in which the working policy of disclosure
of related intellectual property rights (IPR) is
treated by the group as a whole as imposing an obligation
to disclose information in order to support
and advance the purposes of the group. Waiver
Order at *19-20. Not only did the district court find
that Qualcomm was silent in the face of a disclosure
duty in the SSO context, it also found clear and
convincing evidence that Qualcomm had knowledge,
prior to the adoption of the H.264 standard in
May 2003, that the JVT participants understood the
policies as imposing a disclosure duty, that the asserted
patents reasonably might be necessary to
practice the H.264 standard, and that Qualcomm intentionally
organized a plan to shield said patents
from consideration by the JVT, planning to demand
license fees from those seeking to produce
H.264-compliant products. Then, after participating
in the JVT and shielding the asserted patents from
consideration during development of the H.264
standard, Qualcomm filed a patent infringement
lawsuit against Broadcom, alleging infringement
primarily, if not solely, based on Broadcom's H.264
compliance. In these circumstances, we conclude
that it was within the district court's authority, sitting
as a court of equity, to determine that Qualcomm's
misconduct falls within the doctrine of
waiver.

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
3. Equitable Estoppel
[12] There remains the question of whether,
even if implied waiver did not apply here, Qualcomm's
conduct falls within another equitable doc-
trine-equitable estoppel. Indeed, Qualcomm argues
that equitable estoppel, rather than waiver, in appropriate
circumstances is the proper remedy for
breach of SSO disclosure duties. Appellant's Br. 54
(This Court and others have recognized that equitable
estoppel, in appropriate circumstances, is the
proper defense when patent disclosure obligations
to SSOs are breached.). Qualcomm claims that
Broadcom chose not to pursue equitable estoppel at
trial, however, and is foreclosed from raising equitable
estoppel on appeal because it did not cross-
appeal the preclusion of that defense. We disagree.
At oral argument, Qualcomm's counsel asserted
that Broadcom cannot now press an equitable estoppel
defense because it chose as a tactical matter
to pursue this as a matter of waiver and not as a
matter of equitable estoppel. Oral Arg. at 6:35,
available at http:// oralarguments. cafc. uscourts.
gov/ mp 3/ 2007-1545. mp 3. Broadcom responded,
however, by noting that it attempted to raise
equitable estoppel as a defense at the trial court, but
Qualcomm opposed the addition of this defense, asserting
that there is no legal or factual basis for the
application of equitable estoppel in this case.
Broadcom argues, Qualcomm cannot withhold
evidence of its JVT participation, successfully oppose
Broadcom's equitable estoppel defense making
false factual assertions about its JVT participation,
and then complain that its JVT misconduct is more
amenable to an equitable estoppel defense than a
waiver defense. Appellee's Br. 57.
In its answer to the complaint, Broadcom included
the equitable defenses of waiver, laches, and
other applicable equitable doctrines. Qualcomm
then incorrectly*1023 asserted throughout discovery
that it never participated in the JVT. As a result
of Broadcom's investigation, however, it discovered
a single publicly available document-a December
2002 membership list for a JVT subcommittee in
cluding the email address of a Qualcomm employee-
indicating that Qualcomm had indeed participated
in the JVT prior to the release of the H.264
standard. Broadcom then submitted an interrogatory
answer contending that Qualcomm is barred by,
inter alia, the doctrines of equitable estoppel and
implied license. Qualcomm subsequently moved for
summary judgment on Broadcom's defenses of
waiver, equitable estoppel, and implied license. In
support of its summary judgment motion, Qualcomm
argued that Broadcom did not sufficiently
plead equitable estoppel or implied license, but
even if it had there is no basis for these defenses
because Qualcomm did not participate in the JVT
prior to the release of the H.264 standard. Remedy
Order at 1240 (noting that Qualcomm's motion for
summary judgment stated, [t]he facts are undisputed:
QUALCOMM employees never participated,
in any form, in the JVT until after the H.264 standard
was already released, and, [t]here is no evidence
that any QUALCOMM participant knew of
the applicability of the patents-in-suit to the H.264
standard prior to the initiation of this lawsuit).
Thus, Qualcomm represented to the district court
that there was no basis for equitable estoppel or implied
license because there was no basis for them in
the facts and because they were insufficiently pled.
Broadcom submits that if Qualcomm had produced
during discovery the 46,000 documents
showing its participation in the JVT, the district
court would almost surely have permitted Broad-
com to amend its answer to assert equitable estoppel,
as Broadcom was permitted to do when new
evidence of inequitable conduct came to light. Appellee's
Br. 56-57. We agree with Broadcom that
Qualcomm cannot withhold evidence of its JVT
participation, make false factual assertions about
this participation to the district court in opposition
to Broadcom's equitable estoppel defense, and then
argue on appeal that Broadcom failed to sufficiently
plead equitable estoppel. Surely Qualcomm cannot
expect to benefit by concealing documents, misrepresenting
facts throughout trial, and then claiming
ex post that Broadcom should have raised a similar

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
equitable doctrine earlier. Although Broadcom's
pleadings may have been deficient in certain respects,
such deficiencies were caused, in significant
measure, by Qualcomm's failure to disclose its participation
in the H.264 standard-setting process.
Under such extraordinary circumstances, any deficiencies
in Broadcom's pleadings should not permit
Qualcomm to escape the consequences of its malfeasance.
[13] We also reject Qualcomm's argument that
Broadcom cannot rely on equitable estoppel in this
case because Broadcom did not cross-appeal the
district court's preclusion of that defense. A cross-
appeal would be improper here because the alternative
doctrine of equitable estoppel would not enlarge
the judgment relative to the doctrine of waiver
relied upon by the district court. See Voda v. Cordis
Corp., 536 F.3d 1311, 1324 n. 4 (Fed.Cir.2008)
(stating that where an argument is merely an alternative
basis to support a judgment of infringement,
it is not a proper basis for cross-appeal and
should be dismissed); Howmedica Osteonics Corp.
v. Wright Med. Tech., Inc., 540 F.3d 1337, 1343 n.
2 (Fed.Cir.2008) (noting that the court dismissed
[a party's] cross-appeal as improper because it did
not seek to enlarge the judgment but merely asserted
an alternative ground to affirm the judgment).
Thus, Broadcom properly raised equitable *1024
estoppel as an alternative ground to uphold the
judgment, rather than a cross-appeal.
Broadcom submits:
If this Court determines that Broadcom's waiver
defense should have been in the form of equitable
estoppel, the proper remedy is to remand to the
district court with instructions to amend the
pleadings to conform to the evidence pursuant to
Rule 15(b), or, alternatively, remand to the district
court with instructions to reinstate Broad-
com's equitable estoppel defense, to reopen discovery
on Qualcomm's JVT misconduct, and to
conduct a separate hearing on that defense.
Appellee's Br. 57 n. 16. We agree with Broad-
com that it is entitled to a remand with respect to
equitable estoppel. However, because of our conclusion
with respect to waiver, a remand to address
equitable estoppel is not necessary here.
4. Unenforceability Remedy
[14] In its March 21, 2007 order, after finding
that Qualcomm waived its rights to enforce the asserted
patents against H.264 products by silence in
the face of a disclosure duty, the district court discussed
the proper remedy to apply in this case. The
district court was unable to find guidance for an
equitable remedy of waiver by a patentee, but it
noted that [i]nequitable conduct by an inventor
and his/her agents before the PTO may result in a
decree of unenforceability of the patent, but the
remedy depends on equitable considerations arising
from the circumstances involved. Waiver Order at
*61. The court reasoned that an equitable remedy to
a finding of waiver should not be automatic; rather,
it should be fashioned to give a fair, just and equitable
response reflective of the offending conduct.
Id. at *62. In light of this, the district court considered
the extent of the materiality of the withheld
information and the circumstances of the nondisclosure
relating to the JVT proceedings. Id.
The district court noted that the theoretical
remedies that appear vary from total unenforceability
of the patents to no sanction of any kind. Id.
The court stated:
The Court sees the obvious connection between
the '104 and '767 patents and H.264 compliant
products. Therefore, the Court is inclined to consider
a remedy consisting of (1) independent unenforceability
of the '104 and '767 patents against
any H.264 compliant products, and (2) inclusion
of the '104 and '767 patents in the MPEG LA patent
pool, which receives royalties from H.264
compliant producers that are divided between all
owners of patents related to the H.264 standard
who are members of the pool.
Id. at *62-63. The court did not decide which
remedy to apply in its March 21, 2007 order. In
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

stead, it scheduled an Order to Qualcomm to Show
Cause why it should not order the aforementioned
remedy. Id. at *63.
On August 6, 2007, after a hearing on the Order
to Show Cause, the district court entered an Order
on Remedy for Finding of Waiver, ordering the
'104 and ' 767 Patents (and their continuations, continuations-
in-part, divisions, reissues, and any other
derivatives thereof) unenforceable against the
world. In reaching this conclusion, the district court
rejected Qualcomm's argument that Broadcom may
not have any remedies beyond itself, because it
raised waiver as an affirmative defense rather than
as a counterclaim or cross-claim. The district court
noted that this court has upheld the unenforceability
of a patent to the world due to inequitable conduct
even when pled as an affirmative *1025 defense.
Remedy Order at 1217 (citing McKesson Info. Solutions,
Inc. v. Bridge Med., Inc., 487 F.3d 897, 908,
926 (Fed.Cir.2007); Semiconductor Energy Lab.
Co. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 204 F.3d 1368, 1372,
1378 (Fed.Cir.2000); Refac Int'l, Ltd. v. Lotus Dev.
Corp., 81 F.3d 1576, 1578, 1585 (Fed.Cir.1996)).
Qualcomm argues that the remedy of unenforceability
entered on Broadcom's defense of
waiver is contrary to law. It submits that once the
jury returned a non-infringement verdict the district
court lacked any legal basis to consider the affirmative
defense of waiver. It appears to base this argument
largely on the fact that Broadcom pled waiver
only as an affirmative defense, as opposed to a
counterclaim. Thus, Qualcomm argues that, because
waiver was pled as an affirmative defense, it
cannot result in a judgment of unenforceability. We
disagree. It was entirely appropriate for the district
court to address the defense of waiver after the jury
returned a non-infringement verdict. As the district
court noted, this court has upheld judgments of unenforceability
based on inequitable conduct even
where pled as an affirmative defense. We see no
reason why an affirmative defense of waiver cannot
similarly result in a judgment of unenforceability.
[15] Broadcom also submits that [t]he district
court, sitting in equity, had the authority to grant relief
as a result of Qualcomm's conduct. Appellee's
Br. 57. By analogy, it claims that successful assertion
of the defenses of inequitable conduct, equitable
estoppel, and patent misuse has resulted in unenforceability
judgments. In response to Broad-
com's analogy to inequitable conduct, Qualcomm
argues the rationale for a remedy of unenforceability
for inequitable conduct before the PTO-that
such conduct taints the property right ab initio-is
simply not present for waiver based on post-PTO
conduct before a private SSO. Appellant's Reply
Br. 27. In response to the patent misuse analogy,
Qualcomm states that [w]hen patent misuse is
proven, a court may temporarily suspend the own-
er's ability to enforce the patent while the improper
practice and its effects remain ongoing. Id.
[16][17] In addition to the analogy to inequitable
conduct, we find the remedy of unenforceability
based on post-issuance patent misuse instructive
in this case. As Qualcomm notes, the successful assertion
of patent misuse may render a patent unenforceable
until the misconduct can be purged; it
does not render the patent unenforceable for all
time. Appellant's Reply Br. 27. In B. Braun Medical,
Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, this court stated:
[T]he patent misuse doctrine is an extension of
the equitable doctrine of unclean hands, whereby
a court of equity will not lend its support to enforcement
of a patent that has been misused. Patent
misuse arose, as an equitable defense available
to the accused infringer, from the desire to
restrain practices that did not in themselves violate
any law, but that drew anticompetitive
strength from the patent right, and thus were
deemed to be contrary to public policy. When
used successfully, this defense results in rendering
the patent unenforceable until the misuse is
purged.

(Cite as: 548 F.3d 1004)
misuse renders the patent unenforceable until the
misuse is purged; it does not, of itself, invalidate
the patent.). In light of the foregoing, we agree
with Qualcomm that patent misuse does not render
a patent unenforceable for all time. Contrary to
Qualcomm's arguments, however, the limited*1026
scope of unenforceability in the patent misuse context
does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
an unenforceability remedy is unavailable in the
waiver context in the present case. Instead, we conclude
that a district court may in appropriate circumstances
order patents unenforceable as a result
of silence in the face of an SSO disclosure duty, as
long as the scope of the district court's unenforceability
remedy is properly limited in relation to the
underlying breach.
[18][19] While the scope of an unenforceability
remedy in the patent misuse context is limited to
rendering the patent unenforceable until the misuse
is purged, the scope of the district court's unenforceability
remedy in the present case was not limited
in relation to Qualcomm's misconduct in the
SSO context. The basis for Broadcom's waiver defense
was Qualcomm's conduct before the JVT during
development of the H.264 standard, including
intentional nondisclosure of patents that it knew
reasonably might be necessary to practice the
standard. The district court correctly recognized
that the remedy for waiver in the SSO context
should not be automatic, but should be fashioned to
give a fair, just, and equitable response reflective of
the offending conduct. In determining the appropriate
equitable remedy in this case, the district court
properly considered the extent of the materiality of
the withheld information and the circumstances of
the nondisclosure relating to the JVT proceedings.
While we agree with the district court that there is
an obvious connection between the '104 and '767
patents and H.264 compliant products, we do not
discern such a connection between the asserted patents
and products that are not H.264-compliant, and
neither party points us to any such connection.
Waiver Order at *62.
Accordingly, based on the district court's findings,
the broadest permissible unenforceability remedy
in the circumstances of the present case would
be to render the '104 and '767 Patents (and their
continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues,
and any other derivatives thereof) unenforceable
against all H.264-compliant products
(including the accused products in this case, as well
as any other current or future H.264-compliant
products). Accordingly, we vacate the unenforceability
remedy and remand with instructions to enter
an unenforceability remedy limited in scope to any
H.264-compliant products.
E. Exceptional Case Determination
[20][21][22] Under 35 U.S.C.  285, a district
court in exceptional cases may award reasonable
attorney fees to the prevailing party. An exceptional-
case finding must be established by clear and
convincing evidence. Forest Labs., Inc. v. Abbott
Labs., 339 F.3d 1324, 1327 (Fed.Cir.2003). In review
of a  285 exceptional case determination, we
review the district court's underlying factual findings
for clear error and its legal conclusions without
deference. Rambus, 318 F.3d at 1088. The district
court's determination of the award appropriate in an
exceptional case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
Id.
[23] Finding that Broadcom established this to
be an exceptional case by clear and convincing
evidence, the district court awarded Broadcom its
attorney fees. As both parties agree, the district
court based its  285 exceptional case determination
both on Qualcomm's (1) bad faith participation
in the JVT, and (2) litigation misconduct ...
during discovery, motions practice, trial, and post-
trial proceedings. Exceptional Case Order at *7.
Qualcomm argues that the district court's award
of attorney fees associated *1027 with the exceptional
case determination must be vacated because
it is based in part on Qualcomm's JVT-related
activities. First, Qualcomm claims that the JVT
misconduct findings are clear error. Second, Qualcomm
argues that a patentee's bad-faith business

conduct toward an accused infringer prior to litigation
does not warrant a finding of exceptionality,
and that at a minimum we should vacate and remand
for the district court to reform the award to
excise the JVT-misconduct findings.
[24] First, the district court's JVT findings are
not clear error. The district court was in the best position
to determine the significance and implications
of the record testimony in the first instance,
and the cited testimony provides ample evidentiary
support for its findings regarding JVT misconduct.
For example, in support of its JVT misconduct findings,
the district court relied upon emails between
Qualcomm employees suggesting extending
Qualcomm's patents in order to cover the standard
being developed by the JVT. Remedy Order at
1228. The district court also relied upon emails
suggesting monitoring the JVT from a distance
and refraining from making any submissions, which
would include patent disclosures, to a JVT parent
body. Id. The district court discussed these and
many other pieces of evidence relating to the JVT
misconduct in detail in its opinions. We are not persuaded
by Qualcomm's claim that the cited evidence
was insufficient.
Second, as previously discussed, the district
court found clear and convincing evidence that
Qualcomm intentionally organized a plan of action
to shield the '104 and '767 Patents from consideration
by the JVT with the anticipation that it would
then have the opportunity to become an indispensable
licensor to anyone in the world seeking to produce
H.264-compliant products. The district court's
litigation misconduct findings-which were based on
the repeated false claims during discovery, trial,
and post-trial, by Qualcomm's attorneys and witnesses
that Qualcomm did not participate in the
JVT in the development of the H.264 standard-
represented the culmination of this plan. Qualcomm
is correct that this court has refused to uphold an
exceptional case award based on a patentee's bad-
faith business conduct toward an accused infringer
prior to litigation. Forest Labs. 339 F.3d at 1329.
In our view, the litigation misconduct findings were
sufficient standing alone to support the exceptional
case determination here, and in the circumstances
of the present case it was not error for the district
court to additionally consider the related JVT misconduct,
which was an important predicate to understanding
and evaluating the litigation misconduct.
III. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing analysis, we agree with
the district court that Qualcomm had a duty to disclose
the asserted patents to the JVT, that it
breached its disclosure duty, and that Broadcom
was entitled to an award of attorney fees associated
with the court's exceptional case determination. Because
the scope of the remedy of unenforceability
as applying to the world was too broad, however,
we vacate the unenforceability judgment and remand
with instructions to narrow the scope of unenforceability
to H.264-compliant products. Accordingly,
we affirm-in-part (duty to disclose,
breach of duty, exceptional case determination), vacate-
in-part (unenforceability scope), and remand.
