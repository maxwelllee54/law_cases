I
This case arises under the Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984,
Pub.L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984) (codified
at 21 U.S.C.  355, 360cc (2003); 35 U.S.C.
156 (2002), 271 (2003)) (collectively, the
Hatch-Waxman Act). Plaintiff-Appellee Eli Lilly
& Company (Lilly) sued Teva for patent infringement
under 35 U.S.C.  1 et. seq. and 28 U.S.C.
2201-02.
The Hatch-Waxman Act strikes a balance
between the sometimes-competing policy interests
of inducing pioneering research and development of
new drugs and enabling production of low-cost,
generic copies of those drugs. A manufacturer that
seeks to market a generic drug may submit an ANDA
for approval by the United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), rather than submitting
a full New Drug Application (NDA) showing
the safety and efficacy of the generic drug. Thus,
the generic manufacturer may rely on safety and efficacy
studies of the pioneer manufacturer upon
showing the generic drug's bioequivalence with the
previously approved drug product. 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(2)(A) (2003).
The Hatch-Waxman Act also requires a pioneer
drug manufacturer to notify the FDA of all patents
that claim[ ] the drug for which the [NDA] applicant
submitted the application. 21 U.S.C.
355(b)(1) & (c)(2) (2003). The FDA lists such patents
in its Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic
Equivalence Evaluations, known as the
Orange Book. Under 35 U.S.C.  271(e)(2), a
generic manufacturer infringes a patent by filing an
ANDA to obtain approval for a generic drug
product claimed by a valid and unexpired patent.
As part of the approval process, an ANDA applicant
must make a certification addressing each
patent listed in the Orange Book that claims the
drug. 21 U.S.C.  355(j)(2)(A)(vii). The Hatch-
Waxman Act specifies the certification alternatives,
(I) no such patent information has been submitted
to the FDA; (II) the patent has expired; (III) the
patent is set to expire on a certain date; or (IV) the
patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the
manufacture, use, or sale of the new generic drug
for which the ANDA is submitted. 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I-IV) (2003). These are commonly
referred to as paragraph I, II, III, and IV certifications.
When an ANDA certifies under paragraph IV,
the applicant must provide the patentee a detailed
basis for its belief that the patent is not infringed,
that it is invalid, or that it is unenforceable. 21
U.S.C.  355(j)(2)(B) (2003). The patentee then has
forty-five days to sue the ANDA applicant for patent
infringement. 21 U.S.C.  355(j)(5)(B)(iii). If
the patentee does not sue, the FDA may proceed to
approve the ANDA. If the patentee does file suit,
the FDA may not approve the ANDA until expiration
of the patent, resolution of the suit, or thirty
months after the patentee's receipt of notice,
whichever is earlier. Id. The court entertaining the
suit has discretion under the statute to order a shorter
or longer stay if either party to the action fail[s]
to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
Id.
In this case, Lilly holds the approved NDA for
raloxifene hydrochloride ( raloxifene ) tablets.
This product is marketed under the brand name Evista
for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal
osteoporosis. Lilly lists twelve patents that
claim Evista in the Orange Book.

2006, seeking approval to manufacture and market

generic raloxifene. As part of its ANDA, Teva filed
paragraph IV *1349 certifications. On May 16,
2006, Teva notified Lilly of its paragraph IV certifications.
Lilly sued Teva on June 29, 2006, alleging that
Teva's ANDA infringed four method patents of its
twelve listed Orange Book patents for using raloxifene
to prevent or treat postmenopausal osteoporosis:
U.S. Patent Nos. RE38, 968 (the '968 patent),
RE39,049 (the '049 patent), RE39,050
(the ' 050 patent), and 6,906,086 (the '086 patent).
The FDA then stayed approval of Teva's ANDA
for thirty months, from the date that Lilly received
Teva's paragraph IV notifications, expiring
on November 16, 2008. Extension Order, 2008 WL
4809963 at *1.
On September 25, 2006, the district court
entered a scheduling order, setting a trial date of
March 9, 2009-four months after expiration of the
thirty-month statutory stay. In February 2007, Lilly
amended its complaint to assert that Teva infringed
three additional Evista  patents-U.S. Patent Nos.
6,458,811 (the '811 patent), 6,797,719 (the '719
patent), and 6,894,064 (the '064 patent)covering
raloxifene particle size and formulation.
On July 8, 2008, Teva amended its ANDA to
include a new particle-size measuring methodology
for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in its proposed
raloxifene tablets. Extension Order, 2008
WL 4809963 at *2. Teva disclosed this amendment
to Lilly on July 10, 2008, and provided it three
batch samples on July 28, August 19, and September
17, 2008. The district court, however, previously
set a discovery deadline of August 18, 2008.
Id. at *4 n. 2. By September 5, 2008, Teva also
provided Lilly with 27,000 pages of related documentation.
Moreover, the district court ordered
Teva to produce additional raloxifene samples to
Lilly by December 15, 2008, in response to Lilly's
motion to compel discovery.
On September 17, 2008, Lilly moved the district
court under 21 U.S.C.  355(j)(5)(B)(iii) to ex
tend the statutory thirty-month stay due to Teva's
alleged discovery violations, prejudicing Lilly's
preparations for trial. Extension Order, 2008 WL
4809963 at *1. Lilly alleged that Teva fail[ed] to
reasonably cooperate in expediting the action ...
as evidenced by Teva's last-minute alteration of its
proposed drug product and its multiple delays in
producing critical discovery ... [which have] adversely
affected Lilly's infringement case and trial
preparation.  Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963
at *2 (citing Lilly Mot. for Ext. of Stat. Stay at I-2)
(second alteration in the original). Lilly also alleged
that Teva prejudiced its preparations for trial by not
timely disclosing its plans to alter the particle-size
measuring methodology of its proposed raloxifene
tablets. Id. Teva allegedly began changing its
particle-size measuring methodology as early as
November 2007 with the goal of avoiding infringement
of Lilly's asserted patents.
On October 6, 2008, Lilly moved the district
court for a temporary restraining order (TRO)
and preliminary injunction to prevent Teva from
launching its product on November 16, 2008, after
expiration of the statutory thirty-month stay. The
court granted Lilly's motion on October 29, 2008,
to extend the statutory thirty-month stay until the
beginning of trial on March 9, 2009. Extension Order,
2008 WL 4809963 at *6. Lilly's motions for a
TRO and preliminary injunction were thus denied
as moot. Id. at *6 n. 5.
[1] Given the urgency of Teva's situation, just
weeks before trial, it filed a motion in this court for
an expedited appeal from the district court's order.
Because the district court continued the injunction
against the FDA, preventing it from finally approving
Teva's ANDA until March 9, 2009, this court
has jurisdiction *1350 over this appeal under 28
U.S.C.  1292(a)(1).

The standard of review in this case is abuse of
discretion in both the United States Courts of Appeals
for the Federal and Seventh Circuits. See

of discretion.); Gile v. United Airlines, 95 F.3d
492, 495 (7th Cir.1996) ( [W]e review a district
court's discovery determinations for an abuse of
discretion.). Therefore, this court need not decide
the question of which jurisdiction's law applies and
will apply an abuse of discretion standard to its
analysis.
[2][3] A district court would necessarily abuse
its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous
view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment
of the evidence. Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx
Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110
L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). While extending the thirty-
month statutory stay, the district court found,
In light of the fact that Teva has recast its product
more than eighteen months after it provided the
original sample to Lilly and only eight months
before trial is set to commence, we find that, in
preparation for trial, Lilly is entitled to have sufficient
opportunity to identify the nature and
composition of the raloxifene product as Teva intends
for it to be sold.
Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963 at *4-5. In
making this determination, the record contained
sufficient evidence, not based on clearly erroneous
factual findings, upon which the district court rationally
based its decision. The court relied on the
evidence in the record that Teva altered its proposed
generic raloxifene hydrochloride tablets late
in the litigation. Specifically, Teva changed the
particle size manufacturing specification of its active
pharmaceutical ingredient and the method of
measuring the particle size. Id. at *2. Teva then delivered
its changed samples to Lilly past the court's
August 18, 2008, discovery deadline.
[4] In making these findings, the district court
acted within its discretion in this area. 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) grants district courts the discretion
to adjust the statutory thirty-month stay of ANDAs
if either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate
in expediting the action. Trial courts, thus,
may shorten or extend the thirty-month statutory
period based on the parties' uncooperative discovery
practices before the court. Allergan, Inc. v. Al-
con Labs., Inc., 324 F.3d 1322, 1337 n. 5
(Fed.Cir.2003) (Schall, J., concurring).
In explaining the statutory language, the House
Committee report specified, [f]ailure by either
party to cooperate in a reasonable manner may be
used by the court to reduce or lengthen the time, as
appropriate, before an ANDA approval becomes effective.
H.R.Rep. No. 98-857, at 16 (1984), as reprinted
in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2686, 2700. Because
Teva provided Lilly with its altered raloxifene
samples just eight months before trial, the district
court extended the stay to provide Lilly with a
reasonable amount of time to allow its expert to test
and report on the altered raloxifene samples
provided by Teva and for Lilly to assess and utilize
that information and analysis in preparation for trial.
Extension Order, 2008 WL 4809963 at *6.
Teva argues that this court's opinion in Andrx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Biovail Corporation, 276
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.2002), shows that the district
court erred in extending the thirty-month stay. In
Andrx, Biovail and Andrx were embroiled in patent
litigation over both infringement and *1351 validity.
Id. at 1372. The filing of the action triggered an
automatic thirty-month stay of Andrx's ANDA from
the date Biovail received Andrx's paragraph IV certifications
on February 20, 2001. Id. Before the expiration
of the thirty-month stay, Biovail acquired
an exclusive license to a second patent in January
2001 that allegedly claimed the subject matter of its
NDA. Id. Biovail changed its manufacturing process
to fall within the claims of the second patent,
which it submitted to the FDA on January 8, 2001,
for listing in the Orange Book. Id. at 1372-73. In a
February 2, 2001, letter to Andrx, the FDA stated
that because of the listing of Biovail's second patent,
it no longer intended to approve Andrx's ANDA
upon the expiration of the thirty-month stay. Id.
at 1372.

Andrx filed paragraph IV certifications with
the FDA on February 16, 2001, that it did not infringe
the second patent and that the patent was invalid.
Andrx, 276 F.3d at 1373. On April 5, 2001,
forty-four days after it received the paragraph IV
certifications on February 20, 2001, Biovail filed a
second suit against Andrx under 35 U.S.C.
271(e)(2) for infringement of the second patent. Id.
The second suit triggered a second thirty-month
FN*
statutory stay ending August 8, 2003.Id.
FN* In June 2003, the FDA amended its
regulations so that an NDA holder could
not obtain additional thirty-month stays
based on patents added to the Orange Book
after a generic manufacturer filed its ANDA.
See Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347
F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2003); Robert A.
Matthews, Jr., Annotated Patent Digest
10:154 (2007). In late 2003, Congress
amended 21 U.S.C.  355(j)(5)(B)(iii) to
eliminate the thirty-month stay for any patent
the NDA holder acquired after the generic
manufacturer filed its ANDA. Pub.L.
No. 108-173,  1101(a)(2)(A)(ii), 117 Stat.
2448 (2003).
Andrx moved for summary judgment under 21
U.S.C.  355(j)(5)(B)(iii) that the district court
shorten the second thirty-month stay. Id. at 1374. In
granting the motion, the district court found Biovail
had intentionally impeded and delayed the expeditious
resolution of the patent actions between it and
Andrx. Id. at 1374-75. The district court, thus,
shortened the second statutory thirty-month stay to
September 27, 2001. Id. at 1375.
On appeal, this court held that the district court
exceeded its authority under 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(5)(B)(iii), vacated the district court's order,
and remanded for further proceedings. Andrx, 276
F.3d at 1370. This court found the district court's
reading of the statute was overly broad. The district
court concluded it could shorten the thirty-month
stay due to the alleged delay in the resolution of
both patent disputes between the parties. Id. at
1376. The district court, however, erred by basing
its decision on Biovail's positions before the FDA.
Id.
Unlike Andrx, in this case, the district court extended
the statutory thirty-month stay based on its
findings of Teva's lack of cooperation in expediting
the patent litigation in its court. The court's findings
were not based on Teva's filing with the FDA.
Moreover, as discussed, the district court's decision
was supported by the record, its factual findings,
and proper application of the law.
III
Because the district court did not abuse its discretion
with its discovery findings and extending
the statutory thirty-month stay to March 9, 2009,
this court affirms. Given the short timing of this appeal,
under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40,
a petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc
must be filed within seven days after entry of judgment.
AFFIRMED.
*1352 PROST, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
The thirty-month stay described in 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) may be extended for one reason
and one reason only: because either party to the
action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting
the action. Because I believe that the majority misapplies
the law and misapprehends the facts in affirming
the district court, I respectfully dissent.
I
The question here is one of statutory construction,
which we review de novo. Although the majority
is correct in that a district court's decision to
issue a stay is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,
see, e.g., Cherokee Nation v. United States,
124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed.Cir.1997), the power to
issue a stay in most cases arises under district
courts' broad discretionary powers to control their
dockets, Gould v. Control Laser Corp., 705 F.2d
1340, 1341 (Fed.Cir.1983). Where, as here, the stay
is explicitly tied to a statutory standard, that stand

557 F.3d 1346, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1921

ard must be properly construed. See In re Princo
Corp., 478 F.3d 1345, 1353-55 (Fed.Cir.2007)
(construing a statute that requires a stay by reference
to dictionaries and legislative history, among
other things). In the past, we have recognized that
interpretation of the stay provided in 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) is a question of law reviewed
without deference. Andrx Pharm., Inc. v. Biovail
Corp., 276 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2002). In Andrx,
Biovail appealed a district court's decision to
grant partial summary judgment, shortening the
thirty-month stay and requiring the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to approve Andrx's Abbreviated
New Drug Application (ANDA). We
stated that [i]nterpretation of statutes governing
the grant of summary judgment presents threshold
questions of law that are reviewed without deference,
then proceeded to do just that, ultimately vacating
and remanding. Id.
But even under an abuse of discretion standard,
the district court's decision should not stand. Let us
be clear about what the district court found. The
district court never made any finding related to the
statutory standard, i.e., whether Teva reasonably
cooperated in expediting the action. The court
briefly described the background of the case and
the parties' relative positions, and noted that the
magistrate judge had ordered Teva to produce various
documents prior to August 18, 2008. Although
Teva did not complete production until September
5, 2008, the court did not purport to base any finding
that Teva failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting
the action on this eighteen-day delay. Instead,
the court's findings were limited to the following:
As this Court observed in its order granting a
limited extension of the statutory stay in Eli Lilly
& Co. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., it appears
important, perhaps essential, that the composition
of the generic drug product for which FDA
approval is being sought ... and which Lilly alleges
to be the infringing product should be
definitively established. That proposition simil
arly applies here. In light of the fact that Teva has
recast its product more than eighteen months
after it provided the original sample to Lilly and
only eight months before trial is set to commence,
we find that, in preparation for trial, Lilly
is entitled to have a sufficient opportunity to
identify the nature and composition of the raloxifene
product as Teva intends for it to be sold.
Teva argues that the circumstances in [Barr ]
are distinguishable from the situation at hand because
the defendant in Barr had failed to provide
Lilly with even one sample of its generic drug
product, whereas here, on December 12, 2006,
Teva provided Lilly with its original raloxifene
sample, and has since produced*1353 to Lilly
three samples of the altered product (the first on
July 28, 2008, the second on August 19, 2008,
and the third on September 17, 2008). Therefore,
Teva contends that an extension of the statutory
stay here is unnecessary because it has fully disclosed
all the required information to Lilly in an
expeditious fashion. Although Teva correctly
cites the factual differences between the case at
bar and the situation in Barr, those differences
are not viewed by us as determinative on this issue.
In Barr, we did not simply extend the statutory
stay through the date on which the defendant
produced a sample of its product to Lilly. Instead,
our order provided that, after the defendant
produced the sample, the stay would extend
through a reasonably expeditious time period for
preparing for trial.
A similar extension is warranted here in order
to provide Lilly with a reasonable amount of time
to allow its expert to test and report on the altered
raloxifene samples provided by Teva and for
Lilly to assess and utilize that information and
analysis in preparation for trial, which is set to
commence on March 9, 2009. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court hereby EXTENDS until March
9, 2009, in this action the period under 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) during which the FDA is
barred from approving ANDA No. 78-193.

Order Extending Stay ). Not once in this order did
the court indicate, much less unambiguously state,
that it found Teva had failed to reasonably cooper
FN1
ate in expediting the action.The court provided
at most two justifications for extending the stay: (1)
to provide Lilly a sufficient opportunity to identify
the nature and composition of the raloxifene
product as Teva intends for it to be sold, and (2) to
give Lilly a reasonable amount of time to allow its
expert to test and report on the altered raloxifene
samples provided by Teva and for Lilly to assess
and utilize that information and analysis in preparation
for trial. Id. Neither of these reasons remotely
resembles the statutorily required finding.
FN1. If anything, statements by the district
court suggest that the court agreed that
Teva reasonably cooperated by expeditiously
disclosing all of the required information,
but extended the stay regardless.
Order Extending Stay, 2008 WL
4809963, at *2. Specifically, Teva claimed
that an extension of the stay was unnecessary
because it fully disclosed all of the required
information in an expeditious fashion.
The court stated that [a]lthough Teva
correctly cite[d] the factual differences
between the case at bar and the situation in
Barr, those differences are not ... determinative
on this issue. Id. (emphasis added).
It is clear from the record, in my view, that the
district court never related Teva's conduct to the
statutory standard. But even if the court had made a
conclusory statement regarding Teva's cooperation,
that alone would not suffice. In Gechter v. Davidson,
we clarified that although we review decisions,
not opinions, a district court opinion
must contain sufficient findings and reasoning to
permit meaningful appellate scrutiny. 116 F.3d
1454, 1458 (Fed.Cir.1997). We went on to state the
following:
A district court therefore may not merely state its
findings in conclusory terms, but must provide
sufficient detail to elucidate the reasoning by
which the court reached its ultimate finding on an
issue of fact or conclusion on an issue of law;
otherwise, the appellate court is unable to carry
out its appellate review function. Indeed, as to the
facts it must also find subsidiary facts
specially, and not just the ultimate fact, here of
anticipation.*1354 If it fails to do so, its decision
will ordinarily be vacated.
Id. In fact, in Nazomi Communications, Inc. v.
Arm Holdings, PLC, our court vacated a district
court's claim construction, an issue that we examine
de novo, stating,
This court's review of a district court's claim
construction, albeit without deference, nonetheless
is not an independent analysis in the first instance.
Moreover, in order to perform such a review,
this court must be furnished sufficient
findings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate
scrutiny. This requirement for sufficient
reasoning applies with equal force to issues of
law, such as claim construction, and issues of
fact, such as infringement.
... Unlike Gechter and Graco, where the records
were devoid of any claim construction analysis,
the district court in this case provided some
claim construction analysis. Nonetheless this analysis
is inadequate because it does not supply the
basis for its reasoning sufficient for a meaningful
review.
403 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing
Gechter, 116 F.3d at 1458; Graco, Inc. v. Binks
Mfg., 60 F.3d 785, 791 (Fed.Cir.1995)) (citations
omitted). As in Nazomi, the district court here did
not provide sufficient findings and reasoning to
permit meaningful appellate scrutiny. Thus, regardless
of whether we review the district court's order
de novo or for an abuse of discretion, the order
should be vacated.

The consequences of the majority opinion are
of particular importance here. Rarely have district
courts had the opportunity to address the circumstances
under which the thirty-month stay may be
FN2
extended or shortened. Those courts that have
addressed the issue have recognized the statutory
standard and strictly abided by it in determining
whether to modify the stay. See Zeneca Ltd. v.
Pharmachemie B.V., 16 F.Supp.2d 112
(D.Mass.1998); In re Brimonidine Patent Litig.,
No. 07-md-1866, 2008 WL 4809037 (D.Del.
Oct.31, 2008); Novartis Corp. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs.,
Ltd., No. 04-Civ-0757, 2004 WL 2368007
(S.D.N.Y. Oct.21, 2004); Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co.
v. Alphapharm Pty. Ltd., No. CIV-99-13, 2002 WL
1299996 (D.Minn. Mar. 8, 2002); Eli Lilly & Co. v.
Zenith Goldline Pharm., Inc., No.
IP99-0038-C-H/G, 2001 WL 238090 (S.D.Ind.
Mar.8, 2001).
FN2. Even commentators have noted that
[s]tatutory stay adjustments have not been
frequent. Gerald Sobel et al., Hatch-
Waxman Litigation from the Perspective of
Pioneer Pharmaceutical Companies, in
Patent Litigation Strategies Handbook
183, 196-97 (Barry L. Grossman & Gary
M. Hoffman eds., 2d ed.2005).
Appropriate findings by the district court are
especially important where, as here, Congress set
forth a clear statutory timeframe and provided one
FN3
narrow exception to the general rule.Only once
has this court examined the matter directly. In Andrx,
we analyzed a single question: *1355 whether
the district court had the authority to shorten the
stay period based on one party's conduct before the
FDA. 276 F.3d at 1376. We expressly limited our
review, declining to reach the question whether
the district court's authority to shorten the thirty-
month statutory stay is limited to those cases in
which there was a failure to expedite the infringement
action once it is filed or whether the authority
extends as well to situations in which the infringement
action was not commenced expeditiously. Id.
In short, this court has not previously provided any
guidance to the district courts as to what qualifies
as a fail[ure] to reasonably cooperate in expediting
the action. To affirm in this case is to effectively
eliminate the statutorily required finding, and to
prematurely terminate the development of appropriate
standards governing modification under 21
U.S.C.  355(j)(5)(B)(iii).
FN3. The legislative history indicates that
the thirty-month stay was a hard-won compromise
between brand-name manufacturers,
generics manufacturers, and other
stakeholders. The length of the stay was
the subject of heated debate in the House.
130 Cong. Rec. H24426-31 (Sept. 6,
1984). Initially, the House version of the
bill provided for a stay of just eighteen
months. H.R. 3605, 98th Cong.  101 (as
reported by H. Comm. on the Judiciary,
Aug. 1, 1984). The Senate version, which
ultimately prevailed, described a thirty-
month stay. S. 2926, 98th Cong.  101
(1984). In light of this fact, we should be
especially careful when reviewing district
courts' decisions to modify the statutory
period. That period ceases to have meaning
when district courts are able to modify the
stay without articulating why the narrow
circumstances described in the statute are
present.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
