United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
In re Bernard L. BILSKI and Rand A. Warsaw.
No. 2007-1130.
Oct. 30, 2008.
Background: Patent applicants challenged denial
of patent application for method of hedging risk in
field of commodities trading based on lack of patent-
eligible subject matter. The Patent and Trademark
Office, Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences,
2006 WL 5738364, sustained rejection of all
claims in application. Applicants appealed.
Holdings: Following sua sponte order of review en
banc, the Court of Appeals, Michel, Chief Judge,
held that:
(1) machine-or-transformation test, rather than test
determining whether claim recited algorithm applied
in any manner to physical elements or process
steps, was applicable test for determining patent-
eligibility of process claims, abrogating, In re Freeman,
573 F.2d 1237, In re Walter, 618 F.2d 758,
and In re Abele, 684 F.2d 902;
(2) machine-or-transformation test, rather than
useful, concrete and tangible result inquiry, was
proper test to apply to determine patent-eligibility
of process claims, abrogating In re Alappat, 33 F.3d
1526, State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature
Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368, and AT&T
Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d
1352; and
(3) claim was not drawn to patent-eligible subject
matter under transformation branch of machine-
or-transformation test.
Affirmed.
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring, in
which Linn, Circuit Judge, joined.
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed opinion dissenting.
Mayer, Circuit Judge, filed opinion dissenting.

Bilski, No.2002-2257, 2006 WL 5738364 (B.P.A.I.
Sept. 26, 2006) ( Board Decision ). Specifically,
Applicants argue that the examiner erroneously rejected
the claims as not directed to patent-eligible
subject matter under 35 U.S.C.  101, and that the
Board erred in upholding that rejection. The appeal
was originally argued before a panel of the court on
October 1, 2007. Prior to disposition by the panel,
however, we sua sponte ordered en banc review.
Oral argument before the en banc court was held on
May 8, 2008. We affirm the decision of the Board
because we conclude that Applicants' claims are not
directed to patent-eligible subject matter, and in doing
so, we clarify the standards applicable in determining
whether a claimed method constitutes a
statutory process under  101.
I.
Applicants filed their patent application on
April 10, 1997. The application contains eleven
claims, which Applicants argue together here.
Claim 1 reads:
A method for managing the consumption risk
costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider
at a fixed price comprising the steps of:
(a) initiating a series of transactions between
said commodity provider and consumers of
said commodity wherein said consumers purchase
said commodity at a fixed rate based
upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding
to a risk position of said consumer;
(b) identifying market participants for said
commodity having a counter-risk position to
said consumers; and
(c) initiating a series of transactions between
said commodity provider and said market participants
at a second fixed rate such that said
series of market participant transactions balances
the risk position of said series of consumer
transactions
'892 application cl.1. In essence, the claim is
for a method of hedging risk in the field of commodities
trading. For example, coal power plants
(i.e., the consumers) purchase coal to produce
electricity and are averse to the risk of a spike in
demand for coal since such a spike would increase
the price and their costs. Conversely, coal mining
companies (i.e., the market participants) are
averse to the risk of a sudden drop in demand for
coal since such a drop would reduce their sales and
depress prices. The claimed method envisions an
*950 intermediary, the commodity provider, that
sells coal to the power plants at a fixed price, thus
isolating the power plants from the possibility of a
spike in demand increasing the price of coal above
the fixed price. The same provider buys coal from
mining companies at a second fixed price, thereby
isolating the mining companies from the possibility
that a drop in demand would lower prices below
that fixed price. And the provider has thus hedged
its risk; if demand and prices skyrocket, it has sold
coal at a disadvantageous price but has bought coal
at an advantageous price, and vice versa if demand
and prices fall. Importantly, however, the claim is
not limited to transactions involving actual commodities,
and the application discloses that the recited
transactions may simply involve options, i.e.,
rights to purchase or sell the commodity at a particular
price within a particular timeframe. See J.A. at
86-87.
The examiner ultimately rejected claims 1-11
under 35 U.S.C.  101, stating: [r]egarding ...
claims 1-11, the invention is not implemented on a
specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract
idea and solves a purely mathematical problem
without any limitation to a practical application,
therefore, the invention is not directed to the
technological arts. See Board Decision, slip op. at

their claims are not limited to operation on a computer,
and he concluded that they were not limited
by any specific apparatus. See id. at 4.

erred to the extent he relied on a technological

arts test because the case law does not support
such a test. Id. at 41-42. Further, the Board held
that the requirement of a specific apparatus was
also erroneous because a claim that does not recite
a specific apparatus may still be directed to patent-
eligible subject matter if there is a transformation
of physical subject matter from one state to another.
Id. at 42. Elaborating further, the Board stated:
mixing two elements or compounds to produce a
chemical substance or mixture is clearly a statutory
transformation although no apparatus is claimed to
perform the step and although the step could be performed
manually. Id. But the Board concluded that
Applicants' claims do not involve any patent-eligible
transformation, holding that transformation of
non-physical financial risks and legal liabilities of
the commodity provider, the consumer, and the
market participants is not patent-eligible subject
matter. Id. at 43. The Board also held that Applicants'
claims preempt[ ] any and every possible way
of performing the steps of the [claimed process], by
human or by any kind of machine or by any combination
thereof, and thus concluded that they only
claim an abstract idea ineligible for patent protection.
Id. at 46-47. Finally, the Board held that Applicants'
process as claimed did not produce a
useful, concrete and tangible result, and for this
reason as well was not drawn to patent-eligible subject
matter. Id. at 49-50.

[1][2][3][4] Whether a claim is drawn to patent-
eligible subject matter under  101 is a
threshold inquiry, and any claim of an application
failing the requirements of  101 must be rejected
even if it meets all of the other legal requirements
of patentability. In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 1365,
FN1
1371 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting *951Parker v.
Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 593, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57
L.Ed.2d 451 (1978)); In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952,
960 (CCPA 1979), vacated as moot sub nom. Dia
mond v. Chakrabarty, 444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct.
696, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980). Whether a claim is
drawn to patent-eligible subject matter under  101
is an issue of law that we review de novo. Comiskey,
499 F.3d at 1373; AT & T Corp. v. Excel Commc'ns,
Inc., 172 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed.Cir.1999).
Although claim construction, which we also review
de novo, is an important first step in a  101 analysis,
see State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin.
Group, 149 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed.Cir.1998) (noting
that whether a claim is invalid under  101 is a
matter of both claim construction and statutory construction),
there is no claim construction dispute in
this appeal. We review issues of statutory interpretation
such as this one de novo as well. Id.
FN1. Although our decision in Comiskey
may be misread by some as requiring in
every case that the examiner conduct a
101 analysis before assessing any other issue
of patentability, we did not so hold. As
with any other patentability requirement,
an examiner may reject a claim solely on
the basis of  101. Or, if the examiner
deems it appropriate, she may reject the
claim on any other ground(s) without addressing
101. But given that  101 is a
threshold requirement, claims that are
clearly drawn to unpatentable subject matter
should be identified and rejected on that
basis. Thus, an examiner should generally
first satisfy herself that the application's
claims are drawn to patent-eligible subject
matter.
A.
As this appeal turns on whether Applicants' invention
as claimed meets the requirements set forth
in  101, we begin with the words of the statute:
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to
the conditions and requirements of this title.

35 U.S.C.  101. The statute thus recites four
categories of patent-eligible subject matter: processes,
machines, manufactures, and compositions
of matter. It is undisputed that Applicants' claims
are not directed to a machine, manufacture, or com

position of matter.Thus, the issue before us involves
what the term process in  101 means, and
how to determine whether a given claim-and Applicants'
claim 1 in particular-is a new and useful
FN3
process.
FN2. As a result, we decline to discuss In
re Nuijten because that decision primarily
concerned whether a claim to an electronic
signal was drawn to a patent-eligible manufacture.
500 F.3d 1346, 1356-57
(Fed.Cir.2007). We note that the PTO did
not dispute that the process claims in Nuijten
were drawn to patent-eligible subject
matter under  101 and allowed those
claims.
FN3. Congress provided a definition of
process in 35 U.S.C.  100(b): The term
process' means process, art or method,
and includes a new use of a known process,
machine, manufacture, composition
of matter, or material. However, this provision
is unhelpful given that the definition
itself uses the term process.
As several amici have argued, the term
process is ordinarily broad in meaning, at least in
general lay usage. In 1952, at the time Congress
FN4
amended  101 to include process, the ordinary
meaning of *952 the term was: [a] procedure
... [a] series of actions, motions, or operations
definitely conducing to an end, whether voluntary
or involuntary. WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL
DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE 1972 (2d ed.1952). There can be no
dispute that Applicants' claim would meet this
definition of process. But the Supreme Court has
held that the meaning of process as used in  101
is narrower than its ordinary meaning. See Flook,
437 U.S. at 588-89, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (The holding [in
Benson ] forecloses a purely literal reading of  101
.). Specifically, the Court has held that a claim is
not a patent-eligible process if it claims laws of
nature, natural phenomena, [or] abstract ideas.

as they are the basic tools of scientific and
technological work. Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93

(holding that mental processes, processes of human
thinking, and systems that depend for their
operation on human intelligence alone are not patent-
eligible subject matter under Benson ).
FN4. The Patent Act of 1793 originally
used the term art rather than process,
which remained unchanged until Congress
enacted the current version of  101 in
1952. But the Supreme Court has held that
this change did not alter the scope of patent
eligibility over processes because [i]n
the language of the patent law, [a process]
is an art. Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175,

ideas.
The true issue before us then is whether Applicants
are seeking to claim a fundamental principle
(such as an abstract idea) or a mental process.
And the underlying legal question thus presented is
what test or set of criteria governs the determination
by the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)
or courts as to whether a claim to a process is patentable
under  101 or, conversely, is drawn to unpatentable
subject matter because it claims only a
fundamental principle.
The Supreme Court last addressed this issue in
1981 in Diehr, which concerned a patent application
seeking to claim a process for producing cured
synthetic rubber products. 450 U.S. at 177-79, 101
S.Ct. 1048. The claimed process took temperature
readings during cure and used a mathematical algorithm,
the Arrhenius equation, to calculate the
time when curing would be complete. Id. Noting
that a mathematical algorithm alone is unpatentable
because mathematical relationships are akin to a
law of nature, the Court nevertheless held that the
claimed process was patent-eligible subject matter,
stating:
[The inventors] do not seek to patent a mathematical
formula. Instead, they seek patent protection
for a process of curing synthetic rubber. Their
process admittedly employs a well-known mathematical
equation, but they do not seek to preempt
the use of that equation. Rather, they seek
only to foreclose from others the use of that equation
in conjunction with all of the other steps in
their claimed process.
*953Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (emphasis ad
FN6
ded) . The Court declared that while a claim
drawn to a fundamental principle is unpatentable,
an application of a law of nature or mathematical
formula to a known structure or process may well
be deserving of patent protection. Id. (emphasis in
original); see also Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio
Corp. of Am., 306 U.S. 86, 94, 59 S.Ct. 427, 83
L.Ed. 506 (1939) (While a scientific truth, or the
mathematical expression of it, is not a patentable
invention, a novel and useful structure created with
the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.).
FN6. Mathematical algorithms have, in
other cases, been identified instead as abstract
ideas rather than laws of nature. See,
e.g., State St., 149 F.3d at 1373. Whether
either or both views are correct is immaterial
since both laws of nature and abstract
ideas are unpatentable under  101. Diehr,
450 U.S. at 185, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
The Court in Diehr thus drew a distinction
between those claims that seek to pre-empt the use
of a fundamental principle, on the one hand, and
claims that seek only to foreclose others from using
a particular application  of that fundamental principle,
on the other. 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
Patents, by definition, grant the power to exclude
others from practicing that which the patent claims.
Diehr can be understood to suggest that whether a
claim is drawn only to a fundamental principle is
essentially an inquiry into the scope of that exclusion;
i.e., whether the effect of allowing the claim
would be to allow the patentee to pre-empt substantially
all uses of that fundamental principle. If so,
the claim is not drawn to patent-eligible subject
matter.
In Diehr, the Court held that the claims at issue
did not pre-empt all uses of the Arrhenius equation
but rather claimed only a process for curing rubber
... which incorporates in it a more efficient solution
of the equation. 450 U.S. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
The process as claimed included several specific
steps to control the curing of rubber more precisely:
These include installing rubber in a press, closing
the mold, constantly determining the temperature of
the mold, constantly recalculating the appropriate
cure time through the use of the formula and a digital
computer, and automatically opening the press
at the proper time. Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
Thus, one would still be able to use the Arrhenius
equation in any process not involving curing rubber,
and more importantly, even in any process to

cure rubber that did not include performing all of
the other steps in their claimed process. See id.;
see also Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707, 729, 26
L.Ed. 279 (1880) (holding patentable a process of
breaking down fat molecules into fatty acids and
glycerine in water specifically requiring both high
heat and high pressure since other processes,
known or as yet unknown, using the reaction of water
and fat molecules were not claimed).
In contrast to Diehr, the earlier Benson case
presented the Court with claims drawn to a process
of converting data in binary-coded decimal
(BCD) format to pure binary format via an algorithm
programmed onto a digital computer. Benson,
409 U.S. at 65, 93 S.Ct. 253. The Court held
the claims to be drawn to unpatentable subject matter:
It is conceded that one may not patent an idea.
But in practical effect that would be the result if
the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure
binary numerals were patented in this case. The
mathematical formula involved here has no substantial
practical application except in connection
with a digital computer, which means that if the
judgment below is affirmed, the patent would
wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula*954
and in practical effect would be a patent on the
algorithm itself.
Id. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253 (emphasis added).
Because the algorithm had no uses other than those
that would be covered by the claims (i.e., any conversion
of BCD to pure binary on a digital computer),
the claims pre-empted all uses of the algorithm
and thus they were effectively drawn to the
algorithm itself. See also O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S.
(15 How.) 62, 113, 14 L.Ed. 601 (1853) (holding
ineligible a claim pre-empting all uses of electromagnetism
to print characters at a distance).
The question before us then is whether Applicants'
claim recites a fundamental principle and, if
so, whether it would pre-empt substantially all uses
of that fundamental principle if allowed. Unfortu
nately, this inquiry is hardly straightforward. How
does one determine whether a given claim would
pre-empt all uses of a fundamental principle? Analogizing
to the facts of Diehr or Benson is of limited
usefulness because the more challenging process
claims of the twenty-first century are seldom
so clearly limited in scope as the highly specific,
plainly corporeal industrial manufacturing process
of Diehr; nor are they typically as broadly claimed
or purely abstract and mathematical as the algorithm
of Benson.
[5][6] The Supreme Court, however, has enunciated
a definitive test to determine whether a process
claim is tailored narrowly enough to encompass
only a particular application of a fundamental
principle rather than to pre-empt the principle itself.
A claimed process is surely patent-eligible under
101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus,
or (2) it transforms a particular article into
a different state or thing. See Benson, 409 U.S. at
70, 93 S.Ct. 253 (Transformation and reduction of
an article to a different state or thing is the clue to
the patentability of a process claim that does not include
particular machines.); Diehr, 450 U.S. at
192, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (holding that use of mathematical
formula in process transforming or reducing
an article to a different state or thing constitutes
patent-eligible subject matter); see also Flook, 437
U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (An argument can
be made [that the Supreme] Court has only recognized
a process as within the statutory definition
when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or
operated to change materials to a different state or
thing ); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 788, 24
L.Ed. 139 (1876) (A process is ... an act, or a
series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to
be transformed and reduced to a different state or
FN7
thing.).A claimed process involving a fundamental
principle that uses a particular machine or
apparatus would not pre-empt uses of the principle
that do not also use the specified machine or apparatus
in the manner claimed. And a claimed process
that transforms a particular article to a specified
different state or thing by applying a fundamental

principle would not pre-empt the use of the principle
to transform any other article, to transform the
same article but in a manner not covered by the
claim, or to do anything other than transform the
specified article.
FN7. While the Court did not give explicit
definitions of terms such as tied to,
transforms, or article, a careful analysis
of its opinions and the subsequent jurisprudence
of this court applying those decisions,
discussed infra, informs our understanding
of the Court's machine-
or-transformation test.
The process claimed in Diehr, for example,
clearly met both criteria. The process operated on a
computerized rubber curing apparatus and transformed
raw, uncured rubber into molded, cured
rubber products. *955Diehr, 450 U.S. at 184, 187,
101 S.Ct. 1048. The claim at issue in Flook, in contrast,
was directed to using a particular mathematical
formula to calculate an alarm limit-a value that
would indicate an abnormal condition during an unspecified
chemical reaction. 437 U.S. at 586, 98
S.Ct. 2522. The Court rejected the claim as drawn
to the formula itself because the claim did not include
any limitations specifying how to select the
appropriate margin of safety, the weighting factor,
or any of the other variables ... the chemical processes
at work, the [mechanism for] monitoring of
process variables, or the means of setting off an
alarm or adjusting an alarm system. See id. at 586,
595, 98 S.Ct. 2522. The claim thus was not limited
to any particular chemical (or other) transformation;
nor was it tied to any specific machine or apparatus
for any of its process steps, such as the selection
or monitoring of variables or the setting off
FN8
or adjusting of the alarm.See id.
FN8. To the extent it may be argued that
Flook did not explicitly follow the machine-
or-transformation test first articulated
in Benson, we note that the more recent
decision in Diehr reaffirmed the machine-
or-transformation test. See Diehr,
450 U.S. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
Moreover, the Diehr Court explained that
Flook presented a similar situation to
Benson and considered it consistent with
the holdings of Diehr and Benson. Diehr at
186-87, 189, 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048. We
thus follow the Diehr Court's understanding
of Flook.
A canvas of earlier Supreme Court cases reveals
that the results of those decisions were also
consistent with the machine-or-transformation test
later articulated in Benson and reaffirmed in Diehr.
See Tilghman, 102 U.S. at 729 (particular process
of transforming fats into constituent compounds
held patentable); Cochrane, 94 U.S. at 785-88
(process transforming grain meal into purified flour
held patentable); Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) at 113
(process of using electromagnetism to print characters
at a distance that was not transformative or tied
to any particular apparatus held unpatentable). Interestingly,
Benson presents a difficult case under
its own test in that the claimed process operated on
a machine, a digital computer, but was still held to
FN9
be ineligible subject matter.However, in Benson,
the limitations tying the process to a computer
were not actually limiting because the fundamental
principle at issue, a particular algorithm, had no
utility other than operating on a digital computer.
Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253. Thus, the
claim's tie to a digital computer did not reduce the
pre-emptive footprint of the claim since all uses of
the algorithm were still covered by the claim.
FN9. We acknowledge that the Supreme
Court in Benson stated that the claims at
issue were not limited ... to any particular
apparatus or machinery. 409 U.S. at 64,
93 S.Ct. 253. However, the Court immediately
thereafter stated: [The claims] purported
to cover any use of the claimed
method in a general-purpose digital computer
of any type. Id. And, as discussed
herein, the Court relied for its holding on
its understanding that the claimed process

pre-empted all uses of the recited algorithm
because its only possible use was
on a digital computer. Id. at 71-72, 93
S.Ct. 253. The Diehr Court, in discussing
Benson, relied only on this latter understanding
of the Benson claims. See Diehr,
450 U.S. at 185-87, 101 S.Ct. 1048. We
must do the same.

FN10
Applicants and several amici have argued
that the Supreme Court did not intend the machine-
or-transformation test to be the sole test governing
101 analyses. As already noted, however,
the Court explicitly stated in Benson that
[t]ransformation and reduction of an article to a
*956 different state or thing is the clue to the patentability
of a process claim that does not include
FN11
particular machines. 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct.
253 (emphasis added). And the Court itself later
noted in Flook that at least so far it had only recognized
a process as within the statutory definition
when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or
operated to change materials to a different state or
thing.  437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522. Finally,
the Court in Diehr once again applied the
machine-or-transformation test in its most recent
decision regarding the patentability of processes
under  101. 450 U.S. at 184, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
FN10. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Am.
Intellectual Prop. Law Ass'n at 17-21; Br.
of Amicus Curiae Regulatory Datacorp,
Inc. at 10-15.
FN11. We believe that the Supreme Court
spoke of the machine-or-transformation
test as the clue to patent-eligibility because
the test is the tool used to determine
whether a claim is drawn to a statutory
process-the statute does not itself explicitly
mention machine implementation or
transformation. We do not consider the
word clue to indicate that the machine-
or-implementation test is optional or
merely advisory. Rather, the Court de
scribed it as the clue, not merely a clue.
See Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253.
We recognize, however, that the Court was initially
equivocal in first putting forward this test in
Benson. As the Applicants and several amici point
out, the Court there stated:
It is argued that a process patent must either be
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must
operate to change articles or materials to a
different state or thing. We do not hold that no
process patent could ever qualify if it did not
meet the requirements of our prior precedents.
Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. In Flook,
the Court took note that this statement had been
made in Benson but merely stated: As in Benson,
we assume that a valid process patent may issue
even if it does not meet [the machine-
or-transformation test]. 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98
S.Ct. 2522 (emphasis added). And this caveat was
not repeated in Diehr when the Court reaffirmed
the machine-or-transformation test. See Diehr, 450
U.S. at 184, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (quoting Benson, 409
U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253) (Transformation and reduction
of an article to a different state or thing is
the clue to the patentability of a process claim that
does not include particular machines.). Therefore,
we believe our reliance on the Supreme Court's machine-
or-transformation test as the applicable test
for  101 analyses of process claims is sound.
Nevertheless, we agree that future developments
in technology and the sciences may present
difficult challenges to the machine-
or-transformation test, just as the widespread use of
computers and the advent of the Internet has begun
to challenge it in the past decade. Thus, we recognize
that the Supreme Court may ultimately decide
to alter or perhaps even set aside this test to accommodate
emerging technologies. And we certainly
do not rule out the possibility that this court may in
the future refine or augment the test or how it is applied.
At present, however, and certainly for the
present case, we see no need for such a departure

and reaffirm that the machine-or-transformation
test, properly applied, is the governing test for determining
patent eligibility of a process under  101
FN12
.
FN12. The Diehr Court stated: [W]hen a
claim containing a mathematical formula
implements or applies that formula in a
structure or process which, when considered
as a whole, is performing a function
which the patent laws were designed
to protect (e.g., transforming or reducing
an article to a different state or thing ),
then the claim satisfies the requirements of
101. 450 U.S at 192, 101 S.Ct. 1048
(emphases added). When read together
with Benson and Flook, on which the
Diehr Court firmly relied, we believe this
statement is consistent with the machine-
or-transformation test. But as we noted in
AT& T, language such as the use of e.g.
may indicate the Supreme Court's recognition
that the machine-or-transformation
test might require modification in the future.
See AT & T, 172 F.3d at 1358-59.
*957 C.
[7][8] As a corollary, the Diehr Court also held
that mere field-of-use limitations are generally insufficient
to render an otherwise ineligible process
claim patent-eligible. See 450 U.S. at 191-92, 101
S.Ct. 1048 (noting that ineligibility under  101
cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the
use of the formula to a particular technological environment).
We recognize that tension may be
seen between this consideration and the Court's
overall goal of preventing the wholesale preemption
of fundamental principles. Why not permit
patentees to avoid overbroad pre-emption by limiting
claim scope to particular fields of use? This tension
is resolved, however, by recalling the purpose
behind the Supreme Court's discussion of preemption,
namely that pre-emption is merely an indication
that a claim seeks to cover a fundamental
principle itself rather than only a specific applica
tion of that principle. See id. at 187, 101 S.Ct.
1048; Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93 S.Ct. 253. Preemption
of all uses of a fundamental principle in all
fields and pre-emption of all uses of the principle in
only one field both indicate that the claim is not
limited to a particular application of the principle.
See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 193 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 1048
(A mathematical formula in the abstract is non-
statutory subject matter regardless of whether the
patent is intended to cover all uses of the formula or
only limited uses.) (emphasis added). In contrast, a
claim that is tied to a particular machine or brings
about a particular transformation of a particular article
does not pre-empt all uses of a fundamental
principle in any field but rather is limited to a particular
use, a specific application. Therefore, it is
not drawn to the principle in the abstract.
[9] The Diehr Court also reaffirmed a second
corollary to the machine-or-transformation test by
stating that insignificant postsolution activity will
not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable
process. Id. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048; see
also Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (The
notion that post-solution activity, no matter how
conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an
unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts
form over substance.). The Court in Flook
reasoned:
A competent draftsman could attach some form
of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical
formula; the Pythagorean theorem would not
have been patentable, or partially patentable, because
a patent application contained a final step
indicating that the formula, when solved, could
be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques.
FN13
437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522.Therefore,
even if a claim recites a specific machine or a
particular transformation of a specific article, the
recited machine or transformation must not constitute
mere insignificant postsolution activity.

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
FN13. The example of the Pythagorean
theorem applied to surveying techniques
could also be considered an example of a
mere field-of-use limitation.
FN14. Although the Court spoke of
postsolution activity, we have recognized
that the Court's reasoning is equally
applicable to any insignificant extra-
solution activity regardless of where and
when it appears in the claimed process. See
In re Schrader, 22 F.3d 290, 294
(Fed.Cir.1994) (holding a simple recordation
step in the middle of the claimed process
incapable of imparting patent-eligibility
under  101); In re Grams, 888
F.2d 835, 839-40 (Fed.Cir.1989) (holding
a pre-solution step of gathering data incapable
of imparting patent-eligibility under
101).
*958 D.
We discern two other important aspects of the
Supreme Court's  101 jurisprudence. First, the
Court has held that whether a claimed process is
novel or non-obvious is irrelevant to the  101 analysis.
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 188-91, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
Rather, such considerations are governed by 35
U.S.C.  102 (novelty) and  103
(non-obviousness). Diehr, 450 U.S. at 188-91, 101
S.Ct. 1048. Although  101 refers to new and useful
processes, it is overall a general statement of
the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent
protection subject to the conditions and requirements
of this title.  Diehr, 450 U.S. at 189, 101
S.Ct. 1048 (quoting  101). As the legislative history
of  101 indicates, Congress did not intend the
new and useful language of  101 to constitute an
independent requirement of novelty or non-
obviousness distinct from the more specific and detailed
requirements of  102 and 103, respectively.
FN15
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 190-91, 101 S.Ct. 1048.So
here, it is irrelevant to the  101 analysis whether
Applicants' claimed process is novel or non-obvious.
FN15. By the same token, considerations
of adequate written description, enablement,
best mode, etc., are also irrelevant to
the  101 analysis because they, too, are
governed by other provisions of the Patent
Act. Section 101 does, however, allow for
patents only on useful inventions. Brenner
v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 532-35, 86 S.Ct.
1033, 16 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966).
[10][11] Second, the Court has made clear that
it is inappropriate to determine the patent-eligibility
of a claim as a whole based on whether selected
limitations constitute patent-eligible subject matter.
Flook, 437 U.S. at 594, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (Our approach
to respondent's application is, however, not
at all inconsistent with the view that a patent claim
must be considered as a whole.); Diehr, 450 U.S.
at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (It is inappropriate to dissect
the claims into old and new elements and then
to ignore the presence of the old elements in the
analysis.). After all, even though a fundamental
principle itself is not patent-eligible, processes incorporating
a fundamental principle may be patent-
eligible. Thus, it is irrelevant that any individual
step or limitation of such processes by itself would
be unpatentable under  101. See In re Alappat, 33
F.3d 1526, 1543-44 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en banc)
(citing Diehr, 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048).
III.
In the years following the Supreme Court's decisions
in Benson, Flook, and Diehr, our predecessor
court and this court have reviewed numerous
cases presenting a wide variety of process claims,
some in technology areas unimaginable when those
FN16
seminal Supreme Court cases were heard.
Looking to these precedents, we find a wealth of
detailed guidance and helpful examples on how to
determine the patent-eligibility of process claims.
FN16. We note that the PTO, too, has been
active in analyzing  101 law. See, e.g., Ex
parte Lundgren, 76 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385
(B.P.A.I.2004); Interim Guidelines for Examination
of Patent Applications for Patent

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
Subject Matter Eligibility, Off. Gaz. Pat. &
Trademark Office, Nov. 22, 2005.
A.
[12] Before we turn to our precedents,
however, we first address the issue of whether several
other purported articulations of  101 tests are
valid and useful. The first of these is known as the
Freeman-Walter-Abele test after the three decisions*
959 of our predecessor court that formulated
and then refined the test: In re Freeman, 573
F.2d 1237 (CCPA 1978); In re Walter, 618 F.2d
758 (CCPA 1980); and In re Abele, 684 F.2d 902
(CCPA 1982). This test, in its final form, had two
steps: (1) determining whether the claim recites an
algorithm within the meaning of Benson, then (2)
determining whether that algorithm is applied in
any manner to physical elements or process steps.
Abele, 684 F.2d at 905-07.
Some may question the continued viability of
this test, arguing that it appears to conflict with the
Supreme Court's proscription against dissecting a
claim and evaluating patent-eligibility on the basis
of individual limitations. See Flook, 437 U.S. at
594, 98 S.Ct. 2522 (requiring analysis of claim as a
whole in  101 analysis); see also AT & T, 172 F.3d
at 1359; State St., 149 F.3d at 1374. In light of the
present opinion, we conclude that the FreemanWalter-
Abele test is inadequate. Indeed, we have
already recognized that a claim failing that test may
nonetheless be patent-eligible. See In re Grams,
888 F.2d 835, 838-39 (Fed.Cir.1989). Rather, the
machine-or-transformation test is the applicable test
FN17
for patent-eligible subject matter.
FN17. Therefore, in Abele, Meyer, Grams,
Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc. v.
Corazonix Corp., 958 F.2d 1053
(Fed.Cir.1992), and other decisions, those
portions relying solely on the FreemanWalter-
Abele test should no longer be relied
on.
[13] The second articulation we now revisit is
the useful, concrete, and tangible result language
associated with State Street, although first set forth
in Alappat. State St., 149 F.3d at 1373 (Today, we
hold that the transformation of data, representing
discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a
series of mathematical calculations into a final
share price, constitutes a [patent-eligible invention]
because it produces a useful, concrete and tangible
FN18
result....); Alappat, 33 F.3d at 1544 (This
is not a disembodied mathematical concept which
may be characterized as an abstract idea, but
rather a specific machine to produce a useful, concrete,
and tangible result.); see also AT & T, 172
F.3d at 1357 (Because the claimed process applies
the Boolean principle to produce a useful, concrete,
tangible result without pre-empting other uses of
the mathematical principle, on its face the claimed
process comfortably falls within the scope of  101
.). The basis for this language in State Street and
Alappat was that the Supreme Court has explained
that certain types of mathematical subject matter,
standing alone, represent nothing more than abstract
ideas until reduced to some type of practical
application. Alappat, 33 F.3d at 1543; see also
State St., 149 F.3d at 1373. To be sure, a process
tied to a particular machine, or transforming or reducing
a particular article into a different state or
thing, will generally produce a concrete and
tangible result as those terms were used in our
prior decisions. But while looking for a useful,
concrete and tangible result may in many instances
provide useful indications of whether a claim is
drawn to a fundamental principle or a practical application
of such a principle, that inquiry is insufficient
to determine whether a claim is patent-eligible
under  101. And it was certainly never intended to
supplant the Supreme Court's test. Therefore, we
also conclude that the useful, concrete and tangible
result inquiry*960 is inadequate and reaffirm
that the machine-or-transformation test outlined by
FN19
the Supreme Court is the proper test to apply.
FN18. In State Street, as is often forgotten,
we addressed a claim drawn not to a process
but to a machine. 149 F.3d at 1371-72
(holding that the means-plus-function ele

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
ments of the claims on appeal all corresponded
to supporting structures disclosed
in the written description).
FN19. As a result, those portions of our
opinions in State Street and AT & T relying
solely on a useful, concrete and tangible
result analysis should no longer be relied
on.
We next turn to the so-called technological
FN20
arts test that some amici urge us to adopt.
We perceive that the contours of such a test,
however, would be unclear because the meanings of
the terms technological arts and technology are
FN21
both ambiguous and ever-changing. And no
such test has ever been explicitly adopted by the
Supreme Court, this court, or our predecessor court,
as the Board correctly observed here. Therefore, we
decline to do so and continue to rely on the machine-
or-transformation test as articulated by the
Supreme Court.
FN20. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae
Consumers Union et al. at 6-10; Br. of
Amicus Curiae William Mitchell Coll. of
Law Intellectual Prop. Inst. at 14-15.
FN21. Compare Appellee's Br. at 24-28
(arguing that patents should be reserved
only for technological inventions that
involve[ ] the application of science or
mathematics, thereby excluding
non-technological inventions such as
activities whose ability to achieve their
claimed goals depended solely on contract
formation), with Br. of Amicus Curiae
Regulatory Datacorp, Inc. at 19-24
(arguing that innovations in business, finance,
and other applied economic fields
plainly qualify as technological  since
a fair definition of technological is
characterized by the practical application
of knowledge in a particular field  and
because modern economics has a closer
affinity to physics and engineering than to
liberal arts like English literature).
We further reject calls for categorical exclusions
beyond those for fundamental principles
FN22
already identified by the Supreme Court.We
rejected just such an exclusion in State Street, noting
that the so-called business method exception
was unlawful and that business method claims (and
indeed all process claims) are subject to the same
legal requirements for patentability as applied to
any other process or method. 149 F.3d at 1375-76.
FN23
We reaffirm this conclusion.
FN22. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Fin.
Servs. Indus. at 20 ([E]xtending patent
protection to pure methods of doing business
... is contrary to the constitutional and
statutory basis for granting patent monopolies....).
FN23. Therefore, although invited to do so
by several amici, we decline to adopt a
broad exclusion over software or any other
such category of subject matter beyond the
exclusion of claims drawn to fundamental
principles set forth by the Supreme Court.
See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae End Software
Patents; Br. of Amicus Curiae Red
Hat, Inc. at 4-7. We also note that the process
claim at issue in this appeal is not, in
any event, a software claim. Thus, the facts
here would be largely unhelpful in illuminating
the distinctions between those software
claims that are patent-eligible and
those that are not.
Lastly, we address a possible misunderstanding
of our decision in Comiskey. Some may suggest
that Comiskey implicitly applied a new  101 test
that bars any claim reciting a mental process that
lacks significant physical steps. We did not so
hold, nor did we announce any new test at all in
Comiskey. Rather, we simply recognized that the
Supreme Court has held that mental processes, like
fundamental principles, are excluded by  101 because
[p]henomena of nature, though just dis

covered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual
concepts ... are the basic tools of scientific and
technological work.  Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1377
(quoting Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253)
(emphasis added). And we actually applied the machine-
or-transformation test to determine whether
various claims at issue were *961 drawn to patent
FN24
eligible subject matter.Id. at 1379
(Comiskey has conceded that these claims do not
require a machine, and these claims evidently do
not describe a process of manufacture or a process
for the alteration of a composition of matter.). Because
those claims failed the machine-
or-transformation test, we held that they were
drawn solely to a fundamental principle, the mental
process of arbitrating a dispute, and were thus not
patent-eligible under  101. Id.
FN24. Our statement in Comiskey that a
claim reciting an algorithm or abstract idea
can state statutory subject matter only if, as
employed in the process, it is embodied in,
operates on, transforms, or otherwise involves
another class of statutory subject
matter, i.e., a machine, manufacture, or
composition of matter, 499 F.3d at 1376,
was simply a summarization of the Supreme
Court's machine-or-transformation
test and should not be understood as altering
that test.
[14][15] Further, not only did we not rely on a
physical steps test in Comiskey, but we have criticized
such an approach to the  101 analysis in
earlier decisions. In AT & T, we rejected a
physical limitations test and noted that the mere
fact that a claimed invention involves inputting
numbers, calculating numbers, outputting numbers,
and storing numbers, in and of itself, would not
render it nonstatutory subject matter. 172 F.3d at
1359 (quoting State St., 149 F.3d at 1374). The
same reasoning applies when the claim at issue recites
fundamental principles other than mathematical
algorithms. Thus, the proper inquiry under  101
is not whether the process claim recites sufficient
physical steps, but rather whether the claim meets
FN25
the machine-or-transformation test.As a result,
even a claim that recites physical steps but
neither recites a particular machine or apparatus,
nor transforms any article into a different state or
thing, is not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter.
Conversely, a claim that purportedly lacks any
physical steps but is still tied to a machine or
achieves an eligible transformation passes muster
FN26
under  101.
FN25. Thus, it is simply inapposite to the
101 analysis whether process steps performed
by software on a computer are sufficiently
physical.
FN26. Of course, a claimed process
wherein all of the process steps may be
performed entirely in the human mind is
obviously not tied to any machine and does
not transform any article into a different
state or thing. As a result, it would not be
patent-eligible under  101.
B.
With these preliminary issues resolved, we now
turn to how our case law elaborates on the  101
analysis set forth by the Supreme Court. To the extent
that some of the reasoning in these decisions
relied on considerations or tests, such as useful,
concrete and tangible result, that are no longer valid
as explained above, those aspects of the decisions
should no longer be relied on. Thus, we
reexamine the facts of certain cases under the correct
test to glean greater guidance as to how to perform
the  101 analysis using the machine-
or-transformation test.
[16][17][18] The machine-or-transformation
test is a two-branched inquiry; an applicant may
show that a process claim satisfies  101 either by
showing that his claim is tied to a particular machine,
or by showing that his claim transforms an
article. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253.
Certain considerations are applicable to analysis
under either branch. First, as illustrated by Benson
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 20
545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
and discussed below, the use of a specific machine
or transformation of an article must impose meaningful
limits on the claim's scope to impart patent-
eligibility. See *962Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72, 93
S.Ct. 253. Second, the involvement of the machine
or transformation in the claimed process must not
merely be insignificant extra-solution activity. See
Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522.
As to machine implementation, Applicants
themselves admit that the language of claim 1 does
not limit any process step to any specific machine
or apparatus. See Appellants' Br. at 11. As a result,
issues specific to the machine implementation part
of the test are not before us today. We leave to future
cases the elaboration of the precise contours of
machine implementation, as well as the answers to
particular questions, such as whether or when recitation
of a computer suffices to tie a process claim
to a particular machine.
[19][20] We will, however, consider some of
our past cases to gain insight into the transformation
part of the test. A claimed process is patent-
eligible if it transforms an article into a different
state or thing. This transformation must be central
to the purpose of the claimed process. But the main
aspect of the transformation test that requires clarification
here is what sorts of things constitute
articles such that their transformation is sufficient
to impart patent-eligibility under  101. It is virtually
self-evident that a process for a chemical or
physical transformation of physical objects or substances
is patent-eligible subject matter. As the Supreme
Court stated in Benson:
[T]he arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof
cloth, vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores ...
are instances, however, where the use of chemical
substances or physical acts, such as temperature
control, changes articles or materials. The
chemical process or the physical acts which
transform the raw material are, however, sufficiently
definite to confine the patent monopoly
within rather definite bounds.
409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct. 253 (quoting Corning
v. Burden, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 267-68, 14 L.Ed.
683 (1854)); see also Diehr, 450 U.S. at 184, 101
S.Ct. 1048 (process of curing rubber); Tilghman,
102 U.S. at 729 (process of reducing fats into constituent
acids and glycerine).
The raw materials of many information-age
processes, however, are electronic signals and electronically-
manipulated data. And some so-called
business methods, such as that claimed in the
present case, involve the manipulation of even
more abstract constructs such as legal obligations,
organizational relationships, and business risks.
Which, if any, of these processes qualify as a transformation
or reduction of an article into a different
state or thing constituting patent-eligible subject
matter?
Our case law has taken a measured approach to
this question, and we see no reason here to expand
the boundaries of what constitutes patent-eligible
transformations of articles.
Our predecessor court's mixed result in Abele
illustrates this point. There, we held unpatentable a
broad independent claim reciting a process of
graphically displaying variances of data from average
values. Abele, 684 F.2d at 909. That claim did
not specify any particular type or nature of data;
nor did it specify how or from where the data was
obtained or what the data represented. Id.; see also
In re Meyer, 688 F.2d 789, 792-93 (CCPA 1982)
(process claim involving undefined complex system
and indeterminate factors drawn from unspecified
testing not patent-eligible). In contrast,
we held one of Abele's dependent claims to be
drawn to patent-eligible subject matter where it
specified that said data is X-ray attenuation data
produced in a two dimensional field by a computed
tomography scanner. Abele, 684 F.2d at 908-09.
This data *963 clearly represented physical and tangible
objects, namely the structure of bones, organs,
and other body tissues. Thus, the transformation of
that raw data into a particular visual depiction of a
physical object on a display was sufficient to render
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 21
545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
that more narrowly-claimed process patent-eligible.
We further note for clarity that the electronic
transformation of the data itself into a visual depiction
in Abele was sufficient; the claim was not required
to involve any transformation of the underlying
physical object that the data represented. We
believe this is faithful to the concern the Supreme
Court articulated as the basis for the machine-
or-transformation test, namely the prevention of
pre-emption of fundamental principles. So long as
the claimed process is limited to a practical application
of a fundamental principle to transform specific
data, and the claim is limited to a visual depiction
that represents specific physical objects or substances,
there is no danger that the scope of the
claim would wholly pre-empt all uses of the principle.
This court and our predecessor court have frequently
stated that adding a data-gathering step to
an algorithm is insufficient to convert that algorithm
into a patent-eligible process. E.g., Grams,
888 F.2d at 840 (step of deriv[ing] data for the algorithm
will not render the claim statutory); Meyer,
688 F.2d at 794 ([data-gathering] step[s] cannot
make an otherwise nonstatutory claim statutory).
For example, in Grams we held unpatentable
a process of performing a clinical test and,
based on the data from that test, determining if an
abnormality existed and possible causes of any abnormality.
888 F.2d at 837, 841. We rejected the
claim because it was merely an algorithm combined
with a data-gathering step. Id. at 839-41. We note
that, at least in most cases, gathering data would
not constitute a transformation of any article. A requirement
simply that data inputs be gathered-
without specifying how-is a meaningless limit on a
claim to an algorithm because every algorithm inherently
requires the gathering of data inputs.
Grams, 888 F.2d at 839-40. Further, the inherent
step of gathering data can also fairly be characterized
as insignificant extra-solution activity. See
Flook, 437 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 2522.
Similarly, In re Schrader presented claims dir
ected to a method of conducting an auction of multiple
items in which the winning bids were selected
in a manner that maximized the total price of all the
items (rather than to the highest individual bid for
each item separately). 22 F.3d 290, 291
(Fed.Cir.1994). We held the claims to be drawn to
unpatentable subject matter, namely a mathematical

IV.
We now turn to the facts of this case. As outlined
above, the operative question before this court
is whether Applicants' claim 1 satisfies the transformation
branch of the machine-or-transformation
test.
[21][22] We hold that the Applicants' process
as claimed does not transform any article to a different
state or thing. Purported transformations or
manipulations simply of public or private legal obligations
or relationships, business risks, or other
such abstractions cannot meet the test because they
are not physical objects or substances, and they are
not representative of physical objects or substances.
Applicants'*964 process at most incorporates only
such ineligible transformations. See Appellants' Br.
at 11 ([The claimed process] transforms the relationships
between the commodity provider, the consumers
and market participants ....) As discussed
earlier, the process as claimed encompasses the exchange
of only options, which are simply legal
rights to purchase some commodity at a given price
in a given time period. See J.A. at 86-87. The claim
only refers to transactions involving the exchange
of these legal rights at a fixed rate corresponding
to a risk position. See '892 application cl.1. Thus,
claim 1 does not involve the transformation of any
physical object or substance, or an electronic signal

representative of any physical object or substance.
Given its admitted failure to meet the machine implementation
part of the test as well, the claim entirely
fails the machine-or-transformation test and is
not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter.
Applicants' arguments are unavailing because
they rely on incorrect or insufficient considerations
and do not address their claim's failure to meet the
requirements of the Supreme Court's machine-
or-transformation test. First, they argue that claim 1
produces useful, concrete and tangible results.
But as already discussed, this is insufficient to establish
patent-eligibility under  101. Applicants
also argue that their claimed process does not comprise
only steps that are totally or substantially
practiced in the mind but clearly require physical
activity which have [sic] a tangible result. Appellants'
Br. at 9. But as previously discussed, the correct
analysis is whether the claim meets the machine-
or-transformation test, not whether it recites
physical steps. Even if it is true that Applicant's
claim can only be practiced by a series of physical
acts as they argue, see id. at 9, its clear failure to
satisfy the machine-or-transformation test is fatal.
Thus, while we agree with Applicants that the only
limit to patent-eligibility imposed by Congress is
that the invention fall within one of the four categories
enumerated in  101, we must apply the Supreme
Court's test to determine whether a claim to
a process is drawn to a statutory process within
the meaning of  101. Applied here, Applicants'
claim fails that test so it is not drawn to a process
under  101 as that term has been interpreted.
On the other hand, while we agree with the
PTO that the machine-or-transformation test is the
correct test to apply in determining whether a process
claim is patent-eligible under  101, we do not
agree, as discussed earlier, that this amounts to a
technological arts test. See Appellee's Br. at
24-28. Neither the PTO nor the courts may pay
short shrift to the machine-or-transformation test by
using purported equivalents or shortcuts such as a
technological arts requirement. Rather, the ma
chine-or-transformation test is the only applicable
test and must be applied, in light of the guidance
provided by the Supreme Court and this court,
when evaluating the patent-eligibility of process
claims. When we do so here, however, we must
conclude, as the PTO did, that Applicants' claim
fails the test.
Applicants' claim is similar to the claims we
held unpatentable under  101 in Comiskey. There,
the applicant claimed a process for mandatory arbitration
of disputes regarding unilateral documents
and bilateral contractual documents in which arbitration
was required by the language of the document,
a dispute regarding the document was arbitrated,
and a binding decision resulted from the arbitration.
Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1368-69. We held
the broadest process claims unpatentable under
101 because these claims do not require a machine,
and these claims evidently do not describe a
process of manufacture*965 or a process for the alteration
of a composition of matter. Id. at 1379.
We concluded that the claims were instead drawn to
the mental process of arbitrating disputes, and
that claims to such an application of [only] human
intelligence to the solution of practical problems is
no more than a claim to a fundamental principle. Id.
at 1377-79 (quoting Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93
S.Ct. 253 ([M]ental processes, and abstract intellectual
concepts are not patentable, as they are the
basic tools of scientific and technological work.)).
Just as the Comiskey claims as a whole were
directed to the mental process of arbitrating a dispute
to decide its resolution, the claimed process
here as a whole is directed to the mental and mathematical
process of identifying transactions that
would hedge risk. The fact that the claim requires
the identified transactions actually to be made does
no more to alter the character of the claim as a
whole than the fact that the claims in Comiskey required
a decision to actually be rendered in the arbitration-
i.e., in neither case do the claims require
the use of any particular machine or achieve any
eligible transformation.

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
We have in fact consistently rejected claims
like those in the present appeal and in Comiskey.
For example, in Meyer, the applicant sought to patent
a method of diagnosing the location of a malfunction
in an unspecified multi-component system
that assigned a numerical value, a factor, to each
component and updated that value based on diagnostic
tests of each component. 688 F.2d at
792-93. The locations of any malfunctions could
thus be deduced from reviewing these factors.
The diagnostic tests were not identified, and the
factors were not tied to any particular measurement;
indeed they could be arbitrary. Id. at 790. We
held that the claim was effectively drawn only to a
mathematical algorithm representing a mental process,
and we affirmed the PTO's rejection on  101
grounds. Id. at 796. No machine was recited in the
claim, and the only potential transformation was
of the disembodied factors from one number to
another. Thus, the claim effectively sought to preempt
the fundamental mental process of diagnosing
the location of a malfunction in a system by noticing
that the condition of a particular component
had changed. And as discussed earlier, a similar
FN27
claim was rejected in Grams.See 888 F.2d at
839-40 (rejecting claim to process of diagnosing
abnormal condition in person by identifying and
noticing discrepancies in results of unspecified clinical
tests of different parts of body).
FN27. We note that several Justices of the
Supreme Court, in a dissent to a dismissal
of a writ of certiorari, expressed their view
that a similar claim in Laboratory Corp. of
America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories,
Inc. was drawn to unpatentable subject
matter. 548 U.S. 124, 126 S.Ct. 2921,
2927-28, 165 L.Ed.2d 399 (2006) (Breyer,
J., dissenting; joined by Stevens, J., and
Souter, J.). There, the claimed process only
comprised the steps of: (1) assaying a
body fluid for an elevated level of total
homocysteine, and (2) correlating an elevated
level of total homocysteine in said
body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin
or folate. Id. at 2924.
Similarly to the situations in Meyer and Grams,
Applicants here seek to claim a non-transformative
process that encompasses a purely mental process
of performing requisite mathematical calculations
without the aid of a computer or any other device,
mentally identifying those transactions that the calculations
have revealed would hedge each other's
risks, and performing the post-solution step of consummating
those transactions. Therefore, claim 1
would effectively pre-empt any application of the
fundamental concept of hedging and mathematical
calculations inherent*966 in hedging (not even limited
to any particular mathematical formula). And
while Applicants argue that the scope of this preemption
is limited to hedging as applied in the area
of consumable commodities, the Supreme Court's
reasoning has made clear that effective pre-emption
of all applications of hedging even just within the
area of consumable commodities is impermissible.
See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 191-92, 101 S.Ct. 1048
(holding that field-of-use limitations are insufficient
to impart patent-eligibility to otherwise unpatentable
claims drawn to fundamental principles).
Moreover, while the claimed process contains physical
steps (initiating, identifying), it does not involve
transforming an article into a different state
or thing. Therefore, Applicants' claim is not drawn
to patent-eligible subject matter under  101.
CONCLUSION
Because the applicable test to determine whether
a claim is drawn to a patent-eligible process under
101 is the machine-or-transformation test set
forth by the Supreme Court and clarified herein,
and Applicants' claim here plainly fails that test, the
decision of the Board is
AFFIRMED.

In fact, the unpatentability of processes not involving
manufactures, machines, or compositions
of matter has been firmly embedded in the statute
since the time of the Patent Act of 1793, ch. 11, 1
Stat. 318 (1793). It is our dissenting colleagues who
would legislate by expanding patentable subject
matter far beyond what is allowed by the statute.

Section 101 now provides:
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful
process, machine, manufacture, or composition
of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject
to the conditions and requirements of this
title.
35 U.S.C.  101 (emphases added).
The current version of  101 can be traced back
to the Patent Act of 1793. In relevant part, the 1793
Act stated that a patent may be granted to any person
or persons who:
shall allege that he or they have invented any new
and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition
of matter, or any new and useful improvement
on any art, machine, manufacture or composition
of matter....
1 Stat. 318, 319  1 (1793) (emphases added).
The criteria for patentability established by the
1793 Act remained essentially unchanged until
1952, when Congress amended  101 by replacing
the word art with process and providing in
100(b) a definition of the term process. The Supreme
Court has made clear that this change did not
alter the substantive understanding of the statute; it
did not broaden the scope of patentable subject
FN2
matter.Thus, our interpretation of  101 *967
must begin with a consideration of what the drafters
of the early patent statutes understood the patentability
standard to require in 1793. See Diehr, 450
U.S. at 182-83, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (looking to the 1793
Act).
FN2. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175,
182, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155
(1981) ([A] process has historically enjoyed
patent protection because it was considered
a form of art as that term was
used in the 1793 Act.); Diamond v.
Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309, 100 S.Ct.
2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980). Rather, the
1952 Act simply affirmed the prior judicial
understanding, as set forth in Corning v.
Burden, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 14 L.Ed.
683 (1853), that Congress in 1793 had
provided for the patentability of a
process under the term art. Diehr, 450
U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
A
The patentability criteria of the 1793 Act were
to a significant extent the same in the 1790 Act.
FN3
The 1790 statute was largely based on and incorporated
features of the English system and reveals
a sophisticated knowledge of the English pat

ent law and practice.This is reflected in Senate
FN5
committee report for the bill that became the
1790 Act, which expressly noted the drafters' reliance
on the English practice:
FN3. In relevant part, the 1790 Act permitted
patents upon any useful art, manufacture,
engine, machine, or device, or any
improvement therein not before known or
used. Ch. 11,  1, 1 Stat. 109, 110 (1790).

Likewise, the legislative history of the 1793
Patent Act reflects the same keen understanding
of English patent practice. During a debate in the
House over the creation of a Patent Office, for
example, the Representative who introduced the
bill noted that its principles were an imitation of
the Patent System of Great Britain. 3 Annals of
FN7
Congress 855 (1793).
FN6. Neither of those two instances related
to patentable subject matter or was adopted
in the enacted statute. The first proposed
departure from the English practice was a
novelty provision protecting the inventor
against those who derived their knowledge
of the invention from the true inventor; the
second was in a requirement that patentees
make a Public Advertisement of their invention.
Such a requirement was thought
necessary in so extensive a Country as the
United States. Senate Report, reprinted in
22 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y at 363-64.
The American statute ultimately differed
in some other respects. For example,
Congress rejected the English rule that
the invention need only be novel in England.
The American statute required nov
elty against the whole world and did not
permit patents of importation. See To
Promote the Progress, supra n. 4 at
95-97, 137-38.
FN7. Even the opposing view-urging departure
from the English practice in particular
respects-recognized that the English
practice provided considerable guidance.
See 3 Annals of Congress at 855-56
([Great Britain] had afforded, it was true,
much experience on the subject; but regulations
adopted there would not exactly
comport in all respects either with the situation
of this country, or with the rights of
the citizen here. The minds of some members
had taken a wrong direction, he conceived,
from the view in which they had
taken up the subject under its analogy with
the doctrine of patents in England.); see
also To Promote the Progress, supra n. 4 at
216-17.
*968 Later, Justice Story, writing for the Supreme
Court, recognized the profound influence of
the English practice on these early patent laws,
which in many respects codified the common law:
It is obvious to the careful inquirer, that many of
the provisions of our patent act are derived from
the principles and practice which have prevailed
in the construction of that of England .... The language
of [the patent clause of the Statute of
Monopolies] is not, as we shall presently see,
identical with ours; but the construction of it adopted
by the English courts, and the principles
and practice which have long regulated the
grants of their patents, as they must have been
known and are tacitly referred to in some of the
provisions of our own statute, afford materials to
illustrate it.

While Congress departed from the English
practice in certain limited respects, in many respects
Congress simply adopted the English practice
without change. Both the 1790 and the 1793
Acts, for example, adopted the same 14-year patent
term as in England. Both also required inventors to
file a written specification-a requirement recognized
by the English common law courts in the
FN8
mid-eighteenth century.In addition, as discussed
below, the categories of patentable subject
matter closely tracked the English approach, and in
certain respects reflected a deliberate choice
between competing views prevalent in England at
the time.
FN8. See Christine MacLeod, Inventing the
Industrial Revolution: The English Patent
System, 1660-1800 48-49 (2002); To Promote
the Progress, supra n. 4 at 400, 404.
B
The English practice in 1793, imported into the
American statutes, explicitly recognized a limit on
patentable subject matter. As the Supreme Court recounted
in Graham v. John Deere, the English concern
about limiting the allowable scope of patents
arose from an aversion to the odious Crown practice
of granting patents on particular types of businesses
to court favorites. 383 U.S. 1, 5, 86 S.Ct.
684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); see also MacLeod,
supra n. 8 at 15 (But most offensive of all was the
granting of monopoly powers in established industries,
as a form of patronage, to courtiers whom the
crown could not otherwise afford to reward.). Parliament
responded to the Crown's abuses in 1623 by
passing the Statute of Monopolies, prohibiting the
Crown from granting these despised industry-type
monopolies. Not all monopolies were prohibited,
however: the Statute expressly exempted invention-
type patent monopolies. Section 6 of the Statute ex
empted from its prohibitions letters patent and
grants of privilege for the term of fourteen years or
under, hereafter to be made, of the sole working or
making of any manner of new manufactures within
this realm, to the true and first inventor and inventors
of such manufactures.... 21 Jac. 1. c.3, s.6
(emphases added).
Each of the five categories of patentable subject
matter recognized by the 1793 Patent Act-(1)
manufacture, (2) machine, (3) composition of
matter, (4) any new and useful improvement,
and (5) art-*969 was drawn either from the Statute
of Monopolies and the common law refinement
of its interpretation or resolved competing views
being debated in England at the time. See To Promote
the Progress, supra n. 4 at 239.
Manufacture.  At the most basic level, the
1793 Act, like the Statute of Monopolies, expressly
provided for the patentability of manufactures.
This language was not accidental, but rather reflected
a conscious adoption of that term as it was used
in the English practice. Id. (It is clear that the Congress
sought to incorporate into the U.S. statutory
scheme in 1793 at least as much of the common law
interpretation of new manufactures' as was understood
at the time.).
Machine.  Likewise, the category of
machines in the 1793 Act had long been understood
to be within the term manufactures as used
in the English statute. See id.; see, e.g., Morris v.
Bramson, 1 Carp. P.C. 30, 31 (K.B.1776)
(sustaining a patent for an engine or machine on
which is fixed a set of working needles ... for the
making of eyelet-holes) (emphasis added);
MacLeod, supra n. 8 at 101 (noting, among numerous
other early machine patents, seven patents on
machinery to raise coal and ores before 1750).
Composition of Matter.  Although the 1790
statute did not explicitly include compositions of
matter, this was remedied in the 1793 statute. At
the time, compositions of matter were already understood
to be a type of manufacture patentable un

der the English statute. See To Promote the Progress,
supra n. 4, at 224 n. 4. One example is found
in Liardet v. Johnson, 1 Carp. P.C. 35 (K.B.1778),
a case involving a patent on a composition of
stucco (a composition of matter). Lord Mansfield's
jury instructions noted that by the time of that trial
he had decided several cases involving compositions:
But if ... the specification of the composition
gives no proportions, there is an end of his patent....
I have determined, [in] several cases here, the specification
must state, where there is a composition,

the proportions....

of the Patent Laws in the Seventeenth
and Eighteenth Centuries, 18 L.Q. Rev.
280, 285 (1902)).
Any new and useful improvement. The reference
to any new and useful improvement in the
1793 Act also adopted a consensus recently reached
by the English courts. The common law courts had
first ruled in Bircot's Case in the early seventeenth
century that an improvement to an existing machine
could not be the proper subject of a patent under the
Statute of Monopolies. See Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl.
463, 488 (C.P.1795). In 1776 that line of cases was
overruled in Morris v. Bramson, because such a
reading of the statute would go to repeal almost
FN10
every patent that was ever granted.
FN10. Morris, 1 Carp. P.C. at 34; see also
Boulton, 2 H.Bl. at 489 (Since [Morris v.
Bramson ], it has been the generally received
opinion in Westminster Hall, that a
patent for an addition is good.).
Art. As the Supreme Court has recognized, a
process was considered a form of art as that term
was used in the 1793 Act. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182,
101 S.Ct. 1048 (citing Corning v. Burden, 56 U.S.
at 267-268). The language of the Statute of Monopolies
permitted patents on that which could be
characterized as the working or making of any
manner of new manufactures within this realm. 21
Jac. 1. c.3, s.6. While this language plainly applied
to tangible new manufactures (such as machines
or compositions of matter), it *970 also appeared to
allow patenting of manufacturing processes as the
working or making of any manner of new manufactures.
Thus, under the Statute of Monopolies patents
could be had on the working or making of any
manner of new manufactures. Numerous method
patents had issued by 1793, including James Watt's
famous 1769 patent on a [m]ethod of diminishing
FN11
the consumption of fuel in [steam]-engines.
However, the English courts in the mid-eighteenth
century had not yet resolved whether processes for
manufacturing were themselves patentable under
the statute, and as discussed below, the issue was
being actively litigated in the English courts. In the
1793 Act Congress resolved this question by including
the term art in the statute, adopting the
practice of the English law officers and the views
of those in England who favored process patents.
FN11. Walterscheid, supra n. 9 at 355-56
(emphasis added); see also Boulton, 2 H.
Bl. at 494-95 (1795) (noting that many
method patents had issued).
II
The question remains as to what processes
were considered to be patentable in England at the
time of the 1793 Act. Examination of the relevant
sources leads to the conclusion that the method Bil-
ski seeks to claim would not have been considered
patentable subject matter as a process under the
English statute.
A
First, the language of the Statute of Monopolies-
working or making of any manner of new manufactures
-suggests that only processes that related
to manufactures (including machines or compositions
of matter) could be patented.
Second, the English patent practice before and
contemporaneous with the 1793 Act confirms the

notion that patentable subject matter was limited by
the term manufacture in the Statute of Monopolies
and required a relation to the other categories of
patentable subject matter. The organization of human
activity was not within its bounds. Rather, the
patents registered in England under the Statute of
Monopolies before 1793 were limited to articles of
manufacture, machines for manufacturing, compositions
of matter, and related processes. A complete
list of such patents (with a few missing patents
from the 17th century) was published in the mid1800s
by Bennet Woodcroft, the first head of the
FN12
English Patent Office.Representative examples
of patented processes at the time include:

potashes and pearl-ashes of materials not before

2, 1617 (14 James I) to October 1, 1852
(16 Victoriae) (2d ed. 1857).
Nothing in Woodcroft's list suggests that any of
these hundreds of patents was on a method for organizing
human activity, save for one aberrational
patent discussed *971 below. Rather, the established
practice reflects the understanding that only
processes related to manufacturing or
manufactures were within the statute. The English
cases before 1793 recognized that the practice
followed in issuing patents was directly relevant to
the construction of the statute. See, e.g., Morris, 1
Carp. P.C. at 34 (declining to read the statute in
such a way that would go to repeal almost every
patent that was ever granted).
Third, nearly contemporaneous English cases
following shortly after the 1793 Act lend further insight
into what processes were thought to be patentable
under the English practice at the time the
statute was enacted. Although the issue of the
validity of process patents had not conclusively
been settled in the English common law before
1793, the question was brought before the courts in
the landmark case of Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl. 463,
465 (C.P.1795), which involved James Watt's patent
for a method of lessening the consumption of
steam, and consequently fuel in [steam] engines.
FN13
In 1795, the court rendered a split decision,
with two judges on each side. Boulton, 2 H. Bl. at
463 (1795). Those who viewed process patents as
invalid, as did Justice Buller, urged that a method
was merely an unpatentable principle: A patent
must be for some new production from [elements of
nature], and not for the elements themselves. Id. at
485. He thought it impossible to support a patent
for a method only, without having carried it into effect
and produced some new substance. Id. at 486.
Justice Health similarly found that the new invented
method for lessening the consumption of steam
and fuel in [steam] engines (i.e., the Watt patent),
being neither machinery nor a substance [ ]
(such as medicine[ ] ) formed by chemical and other
processes, was not within the Statute of Monopolies.
Id. at 481-82. In contrast, Lord Chief Justice
Eyres, who believed processes had long been a valid
subject of patents, urged that two-thirds, I believe
I might say three-fourths, of all patents granted
since the statute [of Monopolies] passed, are for
methods of operating and of manufacturing....  Id.
at 494-95 (emphasis added). He agreed that
[u]ndoubtedly there can be no patent for a mere
principle; but for a principle so far embodied and
connected with corporeal substances ... I think
there may be a patent. Id. at 495 (emphasis added).
Justice Rooke also noted that Watt's method was
within the statute because it was connected with

machinery: What method can there be of saving
steam or fuel in engines, but by some variation in
the construction of them? Id. at 478. The Justices
who believed process patents were valid spoke in
terms of manufacturing, machines, and compositions
of matter, because the processes they believed
fell within the statute were processes that
embodied and connected with corporeal substances.
Id. at 495.
FN13. The Supreme Court has in several
opinions noted Boulton v. Bull in connection
with its consideration of English patent
practice. See, e.g., Markman v. West-
view Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 381
n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577
(1996); Evans v. Eaton, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.)
356, 388 n. 2-3, 5 L.Ed. 472 (1822).
In 1799, on appeal from another case involving
the same Watt patent, the validity of such process
patents were upheld. Hornblower v. Boulton
(K.B.1799), 8 T.R. 95. There, Chief Justice Lord
Kenyon stated that it evidently appears that the
patentee claims a monopoly for an engine or machine,
composed of material parts, which are to
produce the effect described; and that the mode of
producing this is so described, as to enable mechanics
to produce it.... I have no doubt in saying, that
this is a patent for a manufacture, which I *972 understand
to be something made by the hands of
man. Id. at 99. Justice Grose agreed, finding that
Mr. Watt had invented a method of lessening the
consumption of steam and fuel in [steam] engines,
and this was not a patent for a mere principle, but
for the working and making of a new manufacture
within the words and meaning of the statute. Id. at
101-02. He further noted, however, that This
method ... if not effected or accompanied by a manufacture,
I should hardly consider as within the
[statute]. Id. at 102-03 (emphasis added). Justice
Lawrence similarly found such process patents to
be permissible: Engine and method mean the same
thing, and may be the subject of a patent. Method,
properly speaking, is only placing several things
and performing several operations in the most convenient
order.... Id. at 106.
There is no suggestion in any of this early consideration
of process patents that processes for organizing
human activity were or ever had been patentable.
Rather, the uniform assumption was that
the only processes that were patentable were processes
for using or creating manufactures, machines,
and compositions of matter.
B
The dissenters here, by implication at least, appear
to assume that this consistent English practice
should somehow be ignored in interpreting the cur
FN14
rent statute because of technological change.
There are several responses to this.
FN14. See, e.g., Rader, J., dissenting op. at
1011 ([T]his court ties our patent system
to dicta from an industrial age decades removed
from the bleeding edge.); id.
([T]his court ... links patent eligibility to
the age of iron and steel at a time of subatomic
particles and terabytes....); Newman,
J., dissenting op. at 1011 ([T]his
court now adopts a redefinition of process'
in Section 101 that excludes forms of information-
based and software-implemented
inventions arising from new technological
capabilities....).
The first of these is that the Supreme Court has
made clear that when Congress intends to codify
existing law, as was the case with the 1793 statute,
the law must be interpreted in light of the practice
at the time of codification. In Schmuck v. United
States, 489 U.S. 705, 718-19, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103
L.Ed.2d 734 (1989), for example, the Court considered
the proper interpretation of Rule 31(c) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The rule,
which ha [d] not been amended since its adoption
in 1944, was a restatement of an 1872 Act
codif[ying] the common law for federal criminal
trials. Because of this fact, the Court found that
the prevailing practice at the time of the Rule's

promulgation informs our understanding of its
terms. Id.; see also, e.g., Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537
U.S. 186, 200 n. 5, 123 S.Ct. 769, 154 L.Ed.2d 683
(2003) (considering the English practice at the time
of the enactment of the 1790 copyright act); Tome
v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 159-60, 166, 115
S.Ct. 696, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995) (looking to practice

(considering the English practice which theretofore
had been evolved in the English Court of
Chancery at the time of the 1789 Judiciary Act in
*973 determining availability of costs under equity
jurisdiction).
Second, the Supreme Court language upon
FN15
which the dissents rely offers no warrant for
rewriting the 1793 Act. To be sure, Congress intended
the courts to have some latitude in interpreting
101 to cover emerging technologies, Chakrabarty,
447 U.S. at 316, 100 S.Ct. 2204, and the categorical
terms chosen are sufficiently broad to encompass
a wide range of new technologies. But
there is no evidence that Congress intended to confer
upon the courts latitude to extend the categories
of patentable subject matter in a significant way. To
the contrary, the Supreme Court made clear that
Congress has performed its constitutional role in
defining patentable subject matter in  101; we perform
ours in construing the language Congress has
employed. In so doing, our obligation is to take
statutes as we find them, guided, if ambiguity appears,
by the legislative history and statutory purpose.
Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204. In Benson, the
Court rejected the argument that its decision would
freeze process patents to old technologies, leaving
no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing
technology. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63,
71, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972). Instead,
the Court explained that it may be that the patent
laws should be extended to cover [such onrushing
technology], a policy matter to which we are not
competent to speak but that considered action by
the Congress is needed. Id. at 72-73, 93 S.Ct. 253.
FN15. See, e.g., Newman, J., dissenting
op. at 981 ( [C]ourts should not read into
the patent laws limitations and conditions
which the legislature has not expressed.
(quoting Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct.
1048)); Rader, J., dissenting op. at 1012
(same).
Third, we are not dealing here with a type of
subject matter unknown in 1793. One commentator
has noted:
The absence of business method patents cannot
be explained by an absence of entrepreneurial
creativity in Great Britain during the century before
the American Revolution. On the contrary,
1720 is widely hailed as the beginning of a new
era in English public finance and the beginning
of major innovations in business organization.
Malla Pollack, The Multiple Unconstitutionality
of Business Method Patents, 28 Rutgers Computer
& Tech. L.J. 61, 96 (2002) (footnotes omit
FN16
ted). In the hundreds of patents in Woodcroft's
exhaustive list of English patents granted
from 1612 to 1793, there appears to be only a single
patent akin to the type of method Bilski seeks to
claim. That sole exception was a patent granted to
John Knox in 1778 on a Plan for assurances on
FN17
lives of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.
Later commentators have viewed this single patent
as clearly contrary to the Statute of Monopolies:

states: it might be wondered why none of

has ever been protected by patenting it.

FN17. Woodcroft, supra n. 12 at 324.
Such protection of an idea should be impossible....
It is difficult to understand how
Knox's plan for insuring lives could be regarded
as a new manner of manufacture; perhaps the
Law Officer was in a very good humour that day,
or perhaps he had forgotten the wording of the
statute; most likely he was concerned only with
the promised very considerable Consumption of
[Revenue] *974 Stamps' which, Knox declared,
would contribute to the increase of the Public
Revenues.
Renn, supra n. 16 at 285. There is no indication
that Knox's patent was ever enforced or its validity
tested, or that this example led to other patents
or efforts to patent similar activities. But the existence
of the Knox patent suggests that as of
1793 the potential advantage of patenting such
activities was well-understood.
In short, the need to accommodate technological
change in no way suggests that the judiciary is
charged with rewriting the statute to include methods
for organizing human activity that do not involve
manufactures, machines, or compositions of
matter.
C
Since the 1793 statute was reenacted in 1952, it
is finally important also to inquire whether between
1793 and 1952 the U.S. Patent Office and the courts
in this country had departed from the English practice
and allowed patents such as those sought by
Bilski. In fact, the U.S. Patent Office operating under
the 1793 Act hewed closely to the original understanding
of the statute. As in the English practice
of the time, there is no evidence that patents
were granted under the 1793 Act on methods of organizing
human activity not involving manufactures,
machines or the creation of compositions of
matter. The amicus briefs have addressed the early
American practice, and some of them claim that human
activity patents were allowed in the early period.
To the contrary, the patents cited in the briefs
are plainly distinguishable.
The earliest claimed human activity patent
cited in the briefs issued in 1840, entitled
Improvement in the Mathematical Operation of
Drawing Lottery-Schemes. Br. of Amicus Curiae
Regulatory Datacorp 23 n.54. But that patent is fundamentally
unlike the Bilski claim, since it does not
claim a method of organizing human activity not
involving manufactures, machines or the creation of
compositions of matter. See U.S. Patent No. 1700
(issued July 18, 1840). Rather, it is directed to a
scheme of combining different combinations of
numbers onto a large number of physical lottery
tickets (i.e., a method for manufacturing lottery
tickets). Id. col.1. The other early-issued patents
cited in the amicus briefs are similarly distinguish
FN18
able.
FN18. See, e.g., Complemental Accident
Insurance Policy, U.S. Patent No. 389,818
(issued Sept. 18, 1888) (claiming a
complemental insurance policy as an apparatus
consisting of two separate cards secured
together); Insurance System, U.S.
Patent No. 853,852 (issued May 14, 1907)
(claiming a two-part insurance policy as
an article of manufacture).
A number of the amici also refer to the
discussion and the patents cited in A
USPTO White Paper (the White Paper)
to establish the historical foundation
of business method patents. See,
e.g., Br. of Amicus Curiae Accenture
14-15 n. 11. As Judge Mayer notes, dissenting
op. at 1001-02 n. 4, the White
Paper does not show this proposition. As
the White Paper itself recognizes, the

early financial patents it discusses were
largely mechanical products and methods
related to financial paper, not methods
for organizing human activity. White
Paper at 2. Thus, while the White Paper
shows that inventions in the business
realm of finance and management historically
enjoyed patent protection, it does
little to establish that business methods
directed to the organization of human
activity not involving manufactures, machines
or the creation of compositions of
matter were similarly patentable.
Likewise, Supreme Court decisions before the
1952 Patent Act assumed that the only processes
that were patentable were those involving other
types of patentable subject matter. In later cases the
Supreme Court has recognized that these cases set
forth the standard for process *975 patents in the
pre-1952 period. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182-84, 101
S.Ct. 1048; Gottschalk, 409 U.S. at 69-70, 93 S.Ct.
253. The leading case is Corning v. Burden, 56
U.S. 252, 15 How. 252, 14 L.Ed. 683 (1853).
There, the Supreme Court discussed the patentability
of processes:
A process, eo nomine, is not made the subject
of a patent in our act of Congress. It is included
under the general term useful art. An art may
require one or more processes or machines in order
to produce a certain result or manufacture.
The term machine includes every mechanical
device or combination of mechanical powers and
devices to perform some function and produce a
certain effect or result. But where the result or effect
is produced by chemical action, by the operation
or application of some element or power of
nature, or of one substance to another, such
modes, methods, or operations, are called
processes. A new process is usually the result
of discovery; a machine, of invention. The arts of
tanning, dyeing, making water-proof cloth, vulcanizing
India rubber, smelting ores, and numerous
others are usually carried on by processes, as
distinguished from machines.... It is for the discovery
or invention of some practicable method
or means of producing a beneficial result or effect
that a patent is granted, and not for the result
or effect itself. It is when the term process is used
to represent the means or method of producing a
result that it is patentable, and it will include all
methods or means which are not effected by
mechanism or mechanical combinations.
Id. at 267-68 (emphases added). In Cochrane v.
Deener, the Court clarified its understanding of a
patentable process:
That a process may be patentable, irrespective
of the particular form of the instrumentalities
used, cannot be disputed.... A process is a mode
of treatment of certain materials to produce a
given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed
upon the subject-matter to be transformed
and reduced to a different state or thing. If new
and useful, it is just as patentable as is a piece of
machinery. In the language of the patent law, it is
an art. The machinery pointed out as suitable to
perform the process may or may not be new or
patentable; whilst the process itself may be altogether
new, and produce an entirely new result.
The process requires that certain things should
be done with certain substances, and in a certain
order; but the tools to be used in doing this may
be of secondary consequence.
94 U.S. 780, 787-88, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876)
(emphases added). Finally, in Tilghman v. Proctor,
102 U.S. 707, 722, 26 L.Ed. 279 (1880), the Court
noted:
That a patent can be granted for a process there
can be no doubt. The patent law is not confined
to new machines and new compositions of matter,
but extends to any new and useful art or manufacture.
A manufacturing process is clearly an
art, within the meaning of the law.
(Emphasis added). The Court's definition of a
patentable process was well-accepted and consist
ently applied by the courts of appeals. See, e.g.,
P.E. Sharpless Co. v. Crawford Farms, 287 F. 655,
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

658-59 (2nd Cir.1923); Chicago Sugar-Refining
Co. v. Charles Pope Glucose Co., 84 F. 977, 982
(7th Cir.1898).
Finally, nothing in the legislative history of the
1952 Act suggests that Congress intended to enlarge
the category of patentable subject matter to
include patents such as the method Bilski attempts
to claim. As discussed above, the only change made
by the 1952 Act was in replacing the word *976
art with the word process. The Supreme Court
has already concluded that this change did not alter
the substantive understanding of the statute. See
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048 ([A] process
has historically enjoyed patent protection because
it was considered a form of art as that term
was used in the 1793 Act.).
The House Report accompanying the 1952 bill
includes the now-famous reference to anything under
the sun made by man:
A person may have invented a machine or a
manufacture, which may include anything under
the sun made by man, but it is not necessarily
patentable under section 101 unless the conditions
of the title are fulfilled.
H.R.1923 at 7. Although this passage has been
used by our court in past cases to justify a broad interpretation
of patentable subject matter, I agree
with Judge Mayer that, when read in context, the
statement undercuts the notion that Congress intended
to expand the scope of  101. See Mayer, J.,
dissenting op. at 1000. It refers to things made by
man, not to methods of organizing human activity.
In this respect, the language is reminiscent of the
1799 use of the phrase something made by the
hands of man by Chief Justice Lord Kenyon as a
limitation on patentable subject matter under the
Statute of Monopolies. The idea that an invention
must be made by man was used to distinguish a
philosophical principle only, neither organized or
capable of being organized from a patentable manufacture.
Hornblower, 8 T.R. at 98. Lord Kenyon
held that the patent before him was not based on a
mere principle, but was rather a patent for a manufacture,
which I understand to be something made
by the hands of man. Id. at 98 (emphases added);
accord American Fruit Growers v. Brogdex Co.,
283 U.S. 1, 11, 51 S.Ct. 328, 75 L.Ed. 801 (1931)
(giving anything made for use from raw or prepared
materials as one definition of
manufacture).
In short, the history of  101 fully supports the
majority's holding that Bilski's claim does not recite
patentable subject matter. Our decision does not reflect
legislative work, but rather careful and respectful
adherence to the Congressional purpose.
NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
The court today acts en banc to impose a new
and far-reaching restriction on the kinds of inventions
that are eligible to participate in the patent
system. The court achieves this result by redefining
the word process in the patent statute, to exclude
all processes that do not transform physical matter
or that are not performed by machines. The court
thus excludes many of the kinds of inventions that
apply today's electronic and photonic technologies,
as well as other processes that handle data and information
in novel ways. Such processes have long
been patent eligible, and contribute to the vigor and
variety of today's Information Age. This exclusion
of process inventions is contrary to statute, contrary
to precedent, and a negation of the constitutional
mandate. Its impact on the future, as well as on the
thousands of patents already granted, is unknown.
This exclusion is imposed at the threshold, before
it is determined whether the excluded process
is new, non-obvious, enabled, described, particularly
claimed, etc.; that is, before the new process is
examined for patentability. For example, we do not
know whether the Bilski process would be found
patentable under the statutory criteria, for they were
never applied.

societal change. Revision of the commercial structure
affecting major aspects of today's industry
should be approached with care, for there has been
significant reliance on the law as it has existed, as
many amici curiae pointed out. Indeed, the full
reach of today's change of law is not clear, and the
majority opinion states that many existing situations
may require reassessment under the new criteria.
Uncertainty is the enemy of innovation. These
new uncertainties not only diminish the incentives
available to new enterprise, but disrupt the settled
expectations of those who relied on the law as it existed.
I respectfully dissent.
DISCUSSION
The court's exclusion of specified process inventions
from access to the patent system is
achieved by redefining the word process in the
patent statute. However, the court's redefinition is
contrary to statute and to explicit rulings of the Supreme
Court and this court. I start with the statute:
Section 101 is the statement of statutory eligibility
From the first United States patent act in 1790,
the subject matter of the useful arts has been
stated broadly, lest advance restraints inhibit the
unknown future. The nature of patent-eligible subject
matter has received judicial attention over the
years, as new issues arose with advances in science
and technology. The Supreme Court has consistently
confirmed the constitutional and legislative
purpose of providing a broadly applicable incentive
to commerce and creativity, through this system of
limited exclusivity. Concurrently, the Court early
explained the limits of patentable subject matter, in
that fundamental truths were not intended to be
included in a system of exclusive rights, for they
are the general foundations of knowledge. Thus
laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract
ideas are not subject to patenting. Several rulings of
the Court have reviewed patent eligibility in light of
these fundamentals. However, the Court explicitly
negated today's restrictions. My colleagues in the
majority are mistaken in finding that decisions of
the Court require the per se limits to patent eligibility
that the Federal Circuit today imposes. The patent
statute and the Court's decisions neither establish
nor support the exclusionary criteria now adopted.
The court today holds that any process that
does not transform physical matter or require performance
by machine is not within the definition of
process in any of the patent statutes since 1790.
All of the statutes contained a broad definition of
patent-eligible subject matter, like that in the current
Patent Act of 1952:
35 U.S.C  101 Whoever invents or discovers
any new and useful process, machine, manufacture,
or composition of matter, or any new and
useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent
therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements
of this title.
In Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 101 S.Ct.
1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981) the Court explained
that Section 101 is not an independent condition of
patentability, but a general statement of subject
matter eligibility. The Court stated:
Section 101, however, is a general statement of
the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent
protection subject to the conditions and requirements
of this title. Specific conditions for
patentability follow and  102 covers in detail the
conditions relating to novelty. The question
therefore of whether a particular invention is novel
is wholly apart *978 from whether the invention
falls in a category of statutory subject matter.

a known process, machine, manufacture, composition
of matter, or material.
The 1952 Patent Act replaced the word art in
prior statutes with the word process, while the
rest of Section 101 was unchanged from earlier
statutes. The legislative history for the 1952 Act explained
that art had been interpreted by courts to
be practically synonymous with process or method.
S.Rep. No. 82-1979 (1952), reprinted in 1952
U.S.C.C.A.N. 2394, 2398, 2409-10. In Diehr the
Court explained that a process has historically enjoyed
patent protection because it was considered a
form of art as that term was used in the 1793
Act. 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
The definition of process provided at 35
U.S.C.  100(b) is not unhelpful, as this court
now states, maj. op. at 951 n. 3, but rather points up
the errors in the court's new statutory interpretation.
Section 100(b) incorporates the prior usage art
and the term method, and places no restriction on
the definition. This court's redefinition of process
as limiting access to the patent system to those processes
that use specific machinery or that transform
matter, is contrary to two centuries of statutory
definition.
The breadth of Section 101 and its predecessor
provisions reflects the legislative intention to accommodate
not only known fields of creativity, but
also the unknown future. The Court has consistently
refrained from imposing unwarranted restrictions
on statutory eligibility, and for computer-
implemented processes the Court has explicitly rejected
the direction now taken. Nonetheless, this
court now adopts a redefinition of process in Section
101 that excludes forms of information-based
and software-implemented inventions arising from
new technological capabilities, stating that this result
is required by the Court's computer-related
cases, starting with Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S.
63, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972). However,
the Court in Benson rejected the restriction that is
imposed today:
This court's new definition of process was rejected
in Gottschalk v. Benson
In Benson the claimed invention was a mathematical
process for converting binary-coded
decimal numerals into pure binary numbers. The
Court explained that a mathematical formula unlimited
to a specific use was simply an abstract idea of
the nature of fundamental truths, phenomena of
nature, and abstract intellectual concepts, as
have traditionally been outside of patent systems.
409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253. However, the Court
explicitly declined to limit patent-eligible processes
in the manner now adopted by this court, stating:
It is argued that a process patent must either be
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must
operate to change articles or materials to a
different state or thing. We do not hold that no
process patent could ever qualify if it did not
meet the requirements of our prior precedents. It
is said that the decision precludes a patent for any
program servicing a computer. We do not so
hold.
Id. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. The Court explained
that the requirements of our prior precedents did
not preclude patents on computer programs, despite
the statement *979 drawn from Cochrane v. Deener,
94 U.S. 780, 787-88, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876), that
[t]ransformation and reduction of an article to a
different state or thing is the clue to the patentability
of a process claim that does not include particular
machines. Benson, 409 U.S. at 70, 93 S.Ct.
253. Although this same statement is now relied
upon by this court as requiring its present ruling,
maj. op at 956 & n. 11, the Court in Benson was explicit
that: We do not hold that no process patent
could ever qualify if it did not meet [the Court's]
prior precedents. The Court recognized that Cochrane's
statement was made in the context of a
mechanical process and a past era, and protested:
It is said we freeze process patents to old technologies,
leaving no room for the revelations of the
new, onrushing technology. Such is not our purpose.

Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. Instead,
the Court made clear that it was not barring patents
on computer programs, and rejected the
argu[ment] that a process patent must either be
tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must
operate to change articles or materials to a
different state or thing  in order to satisfy Section
101. Id. Although my colleagues now describe
these statements as equivocal, maj. op. at 956,
there is nothing equivocal about We do not so
hold. Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93 S.Ct. 253. Nonetheless,
this court now so holds.
In Parker v. Flook the Court again rejected
today's restrictions
The eligibility of mathematical processes next
reached the Court in Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584,
98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978), where the
Court held that the process category of Section
101 was not met by a claim to a mathematical formula
for calculation of alarm limits for use in connection
with catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons
and, as in Benson, the claim was essentially for the
mathematical formula. The Court later summarized
its Flook holding, stating in Diamond v. Diehr that:
The [Flook] application, however, did not purport
to explain how these other variables were to be
determined, nor did it purport to contain any disclosure
relating to the chemical processes at
work, the monitoring of the process variables, nor
the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an
alarm system. All that it provides is a formula for
computing an updated alarm limit.
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 186-87, 101 S.Ct. 1048
(quoting Flook, 437 U.S. at 586, 98 S.Ct. 2522).
The Court explained in Flook that a fieldof-
use restriction to catalytic conversion did not
distinguish Flook's mathematical process from that
in Benson. However, the Court reiterated that patent
eligibility of computer-directed processes is not
controlled by the qualifications of our earlier precedents,
again negating any limiting effect of the
usages of the past, on which this court now places
heavy reliance. The Court stated:
The statutory definition of process is broad. An
argument can be made, however, that this Court
has only recognized a process as within the statutory
definition when it either was tied to a particular
apparatus or operated to change materials
to a different state or thing. As in Benson, we
assume that a valid process patent may issue even
if it does not meet one of these qualifications of
FN1
our earlier precedents.[]
FN1. My colleagues cite only part of this
quotation as the Court's holding in Flook,
maj. op. at 955, ignoring the qualifying
words [a]n argument can be made as
well as the next sentence clarifying that
this argument was rejected by the Court in
Benson and is now again rejected in Flook.
*980 Flook, 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522
(quoting Cochrane, 94 U.S. at 787). This statement
directly contravenes this court's new requirement
that all processes must meet the court's
machine-or-transformation test or be barred from
access to the patent system.
The Court in Flook discussed that abstractions
and fundamental principles have never been subject
to patenting, but recognized the unclear line
between an abstract principle and the application of
such principle:
The line between a patentable process and an
unpatentable principle is not always clear. Both
are conception[s] of the mind, seen only by
[their] effects when being executed or performed.
Flook, 437 U.S. at 589, 98 S.Ct. 2522
(alterations in original) (quoting Tilghman v. Proctor,
102 U.S. 707, 728, 26 L.Ed. 279 (1880)).
The decision in Flook has been recognized as a
step in the evolution of the Court's thinking about
computers. See Arrhythmia Res. Tech., Inc. v.

Flook does not support today's per se exclusion of
forms of process inventions from access to the patent
system is reinforced in the next Section 101
case decided by the Court:
In Diamond v. Chakrabarty the Court again rejected
per se exclusions of subject matter from Section
101
In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 100
S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980), the scope of
Section 101 was challenged as applied to the new
fields of biotechnology and genetic engineering,
with respect to the patent eligibility of a new bacterial
life form. The Court explained the reason
for the broad terms of Section 101:
The subject-matter provisions of the patent law
have been cast in broad terms to fulfill the constitutional
and statutory goal of promoting the Progress
of Science and the useful Arts with all that
means for the social and economic benefits envisioned
by Jefferson. Broad general language is
not necessarily ambiguous when congressional
objectives require broad terms.
Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (quoting U.S. Const.,
art. I,  8). The Court referred to the use of any in
Section 101 (Whoever invents or discovers any
new and useful process ... or any new and useful
improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor,
subject to the conditions and requirements of this
title), and reiterated that the statutory language
shows that Congress plainly contemplated that the
patent laws would be given wide scope. Id. at 308,
100 S.Ct. 2204. The Court referred to the legislative
intent to include within the scope of Section
101 anything under the sun that is made by man,
id. at 309, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citing S. Rep. 82-1979,
at 5, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, pp.
2394, 2399; H.R. Rep. 82-1923, at 6 (1952)), and
stated that the unforeseeable future should not be
inhibited by judicial restriction of the broad general
language of Section 101:
A rule that unanticipated inventions are without
protection would conflict with the core concept
of the patent law that anticipation undermines
patentability. Mr. Justice Douglas reminded that
the *981 inventions most benefiting mankind are
those that push back the frontiers of chemistry,
physics, and the like. Congress employed broad
general language in drafting  101 precisely be
cause such inventions are often unforeseeable.
Id. at 315-16, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court emphasized
that its precedents did not alter this understanding
of Section 101's breadth, stating that
Flook did not announce a new principle that inventions
in areas not contemplated by Congress when
the patent laws were enacted are unpatentable per
se. Id. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204.
Whether the applications of physics and chemistry
that are manifested in advances in computer
hardware and software were more or less foreseeable
than the advances in biology and biotechnology
is debatable, but it is not debatable that these
fields of endeavor have become primary contributors
to today's economy and culture, as well as offering
an untold potential for future advances. My colleagues
offer no reason now to adopt a policy of exclusion
of the unknown future from the subject
matter now embraced in Section 101.
Soon after Chakrabarty was decided, the Court
returned to patentability issues arising from computer
capabilities:
In Diamond v. Diehr the Court directly held that
computer-implemented processes are included in
Section 101
The invention presented to the Court in Diehr
was a physical and chemical process for molding
precision synthetic rubber products where the pro

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
cess steps included using a mathematical formula.
The Court held that the invention fit the process
category of Section 101 although mathematical calculations
were involved, and repeated its observation
in Chakrabarty that courts should not read into
the patent laws limitations and conditions which
the legislature has not expressed. Diehr, 450 U.S.
at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (internal quotation marks
omitted) (citing Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 308, 100
S.Ct. 2204).
The Court distinguished a claim that would
cover all uses of a mathematical formula and thus is
an abstract construct, as in Benson, from a claim
that applies a mathematical calculation for a specified
purpose, as in Diehr. The Court stated that a
claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory
does not become nonstatutory simply because it
uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or
digital computer, id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048, and
explained that the line between statutory and non-
statutory processes depends on whether the process
is directed to a specific purpose, see id. (It is now
commonplace that an application of a law of nature
or mathematical formula to a known structure or
process may well be deserving of patent protection.
(emphasis in original)). The Court clarified
that Flook did not hold that claims may be dissected
into old and new parts to assess their patent eligibility.
Id. at 189 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
However, the Court did not propose the
machine-or-transformation test that this court
now insists was enunciated in Diehr as a specific
limit to Section 101. Maj. op. at 953-54. In Diehr
there was no issue of machine or transformation,
for the Diehr process both employed a machine and
produced a chemical transformation: the process
was conducted in an openable rubber molding
press, and it cured the rubber. In discussing the
known mathematical formula used by Diehr to calculate
the relation between temperature and the rate
of a chemical reaction, the Court recited the traditional
exceptions of laws of nature, natural phenomena,
and abstract ideas, 450 U.S. at 185, 101
S.Ct. 1048, and explained that the entirety of the
process *982 must be considered, not an individual
mathematical step.
The Court characterized the holdings in Benson
and Flook as standing for no more than the continued
relevance of these long-established judicial
exclusions, id., and repeated that a practical application
of pure science or mathematics may be patentable,
citing Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v.
Radio Corp. of America, 306 U.S. 86, 94, 59 S.Ct.
427, 83 L.Ed. 506 (1939) ( While a scientific
truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not a
patentable invention, a novel and useful structure
created with the aid of knowledge and scientific
truth may be.). The Court explained that the presence
of a mathematical formula does not preclude
patentability when the structure or process is performing
a function within the scope of the patent
system, stating:
[W]hen a claim containing a mathematical formula
implements or applies that formula in a
structure or process which, when considered as a
whole, is performing a function which the patent
laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming
or reducing an article to a different state or
thing), then the claim satisfies the requirements
of  101.
450 U.S. at 192, 101 S.Ct. 1048. This statement's
parenthetical e.g. is relied on by the majority
for its statement that Diehr requires today's
machine-or-transformation test. However, this
e.g.  does not purport to state the only function
which the patent laws were designed to protect. Id.
This  e.g.  indeed describes the process in Diehr,
but it does not exclude all other processes from access
to patenting.
It cannot be inferred that the Court intended, by
this e.g. parenthetical, to require the far-reaching
exclusions now attributed to it. To the contrary, the
Court in Diehr was explicit that an application of
a law of nature or mathematical formula may merit
patent protection, 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048

(emphasis in original), and that the claimed process
must be considered as a whole, id. at 188, 101 S.Ct.
1048. The Court recognized that a process claim
may combine steps that were separately known, and
that abstract ideas such as mathematical formulae
may be combined with other steps to produce a patentable
process. Id. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048. The
steps are not to be dissect[ed] into new and old
steps; it is the entire process that frames the Section
101 inquiry. Id. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048.
The Diehr Court did not hold, as the majority
opinion states, that transformation of physical state
is a requirement of eligibility set by Section 101
unless the process is performed by a machine. It
cannot be inferred that the Court silently imposed
such a rule. See maj. op. at 956 (relying on lack of
repetition in Diehr of the Benson and Flook disclaimers
of requiring machine or transformation, as
an implicit rejection of these disclaimers and tacit
adoption of the requirement). There was no issue in
Diehr of the need for either machine or transformation,
for both were undisputedly present in the process
of curing rubber. It cannot be said that the
Court enunciated today's definitive test in

*983 Subsequent Supreme Court authority reinforced
the breadth of Section 101
In J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 122 S.Ct. 593,
151 L.Ed.2d 508 (2001), the Court described Section
101 as a dynamic provision designed to encompass
new and unforeseen inventions, id. at
135, 122 S.Ct. 593, that case arising in the context
of eligibility of newly developed plant varieties for
patenting. The Court stated: As in Chakrabarty,
we decline to narrow the reach of  101 where Congress
has given us no indication that it intends this
result. Id. at 145-46, 122 S.Ct. 593. The Court reiterated
that Congress plainly contemplated that the
patent laws would be given wide scope, id. at 130,
122 S.Ct. 593 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at
308, 100 S.Ct. 2204), and that the language of Section
101 is extremely broad, id. This is not language
of restriction, and it reflects the statutory
policy and purpose of inclusion, not exclusion, in
Section 101.
The Court's decisions of an earlier age do not support
this court's restrictions of Section 101
My colleagues also find support for their restrictions
on patent-eligible process inventions in
the pre-Section 101 decisions O'Reilly v. Morse, 56
U.S. (15 How.) 62, 14 L.Ed. 601 (1853), Cochrane
v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876), and
Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707, 26 L.Ed. 279
(1880). Although the Court in Benson and in Flook
took care to state that these early decisions do not
require the restrictions that the Court was rejecting,
this court now places heavy reliance on these early
decisions, which this court describes as consistent
with the machine-or-transformation test later articulated
in Benson and reaffirmed in Diehr. Maj. op.
at 955. As I have discussed, no such test was
articulated in Benson  and reaffirmed in Diehr.
However, these early cases do show, contrary
to the majority opinion, that a process has always
been a distinct category of patentable invention,
and not tied to either apparatus or transformation,
as this court now holds. For example, in Tilghman
v. Proctor the Court considered a patent on a process
for separating fats and oils, and held that the
process was not restricted to any particular apparat

545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
us. The Court held that a process is an independent
category of invention, and stated:
That a patent can be granted for a process, there
can be no doubt. The patent law is not confined
to new machines and new compositions of matter,
but extends to any new and useful art or manufacture.
102 U.S. at 722; see also Corning v. Burden,
56 U.S. (15 How.) 252, 268, 14 L.Ed. 683 (1853)
(It is for the discovery or invention of some practical
method or means of producing a beneficial
result or effect, that a patent is granted, and not for
the result or effect itself.) The difference between
a process and the other categories of patent-eligible
subject matter does not deprive process inventions
of the independent status accorded by statute, by
precedent, and by logic, all of which negate the
court's new rule that a process must be tied to a particular
machine or must transform physical matter.
The majority also relies on O'Reilly v. Morse,
citing the Court's rejection of Morse's Claim 8 for
the use of the motive power of the electro or galvanic
current, which I call electromagnetism,
however developed, for making or printing intelligible
characters, signs or letters at any distances....
The Court explained:
In fine he claims an exclusive right to use a manner
and process which he has not described and
indeed had not invented, and therefore could not
describe when he obtained his patent. The Court
*984 is of the opinion that the claim is too broad,
and not warranted by law.
56 U.S. (15 How.) at 113. However, the claims
that were directed to the communication system
that was described by Morse were held patentable,
although no machine, transformation, or manufacture
was required. See Morse's Claim 5 (The system
of signs, consisting of dots and spaces, and horizontal
lines, for numerals, letters, words, or sentences,
substantially as herein set forth and illustrated,
for telegraphic purposes.). I cannot discern
how the Court's rejection of Morse's Claim 8 on
what would now be Section 112 grounds, or the allowance
of his other claims, supports this court's
ruling today. Indeed, Morse's claim 5, to a system
of signs, is no more tangible than the systems
held patentable in Alappat and State Street Bank,
discussed post and now cast into doubt, or the Bil-
ski system here held ineligible for access to patenting.
The majority opinion also relies on Cochrane
v. Deener, particularly on certain words quoted in
subsequent opinions of the Court. In Cochrane the
invention was a method for bolting flour, described
as a series of mechanical steps in the processing of
flour meal. The question before the Court was
whether the patented process would be infringed if
the same steps were performed using different machinery.
The answer was that a process may be
patentable, irrespective of the particular form of the
instrumentalities used. 94 U.S. at 788. The Court
stressed the independence of a process from the
tools that perform it:
A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials
to produce a given result. It is an act, or
series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter
to be transformed and reduced to a different state
or thing. If new and useful, it is just as patentable
as is a piece of machinery. In the language of the
patent law, it is an art. The machinery pointed out
as suitable to perform the process may or may not
be new or patentable; whilst the process itself
may be altogether new, and produce an entirely
new result. The process requires that certain
things should be done with certain substances,
and in a certain order; but the tools to be used in
doing this may be of secondary consequence.
94 U.S. at 788. The Court did not restrict the
kinds of patentable processes; the issue in Cochrane
was whether the process must be tied to the
machinery that the patentee used to perform it.
This court now cites Cochrane's description of
a process as acts performed upon subject-matter to

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
be transformed and reduced to a different state or
thing, id., this court stating that unless there is
transformation there is no patentable process. That
is not what this passage means. In earlier opinions
this court and its predecessor court stated the correct
view of this passage, as has the Supreme Court.
The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals observed:
[This Cochrane passage] has sometimes been
misconstrued as a rule or definition requiring
that all processes, to be patentable, must operate
physically on substances. Such a result misapprehends
the nature of the passage quoted as dictum,
in its context, and the question being discussed
by the author of the opinion. To deduce such a
rule from the statement would be contrary to its
intendment which was not to limit process patentability
but to point out that a process is not
limited to the means used in performing it.
In re Prater, 56 C.C.P.A. 1381, 415 F.2d 1393,
1403 (1969). Again in In re Schrader, 22 F.3d 290,
295 n. 12 (Fed.Cir.1994) this court noted that Cochrane
did not limit patent eligible subject matter to
*985 physical transformation, and that transformation
of intangibles could qualify for patenting. In
AT & T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172
F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed.Cir.1999), this court described
physical transformation as merely one example
of how a mathematical algorithm may bring
about a useful application.
The Court saw the Cochrane decision in its
proper perspective. Both Flook and Benson rejected
the idea that Cochrane imposed the requirement of
either specific machinery or the transformation of
matter, as discussed ante. See Flook, 437 U.S. at
588 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522; Benson, 409 U.S. at 71, 93
S.Ct. 253. Non-transformative processes were not
at issue in either Cochrane or Diehr, and there is no
endorsement in Diehr of a
machine-or-transformation requirement for patentable
processes.
These early cases cannot be held now to re
quire exclusion, from the Section 101 definition of
process, of all processes that deal with data and
information, whose only machinery is electrons,
photons, or waves, or whose product is not a transformed
physical substance.
The English Statute of Monopolies and English
common law do not limit process in Section 101
I comment on this aspect in view of the proposal
in the concurring opinion that this court's new
two-prong test for Section 101 process inventions
was implicit in United States law starting with the
Act of 1790, because of Congress's knowledge of
and importation of English common law and the
English Statute of Monopolies of 1623. The full
history of patent law in England is too ambitious to
be achieved within the confines of Bilski's appeal,
FN3
and the concurring opinion's selective treatment
of this history may propagate misunderstanding.

The concurrence places primary reliance on the
Statute of Monopolies, which was enacted in response
to the monarchy's grant of monopolies to
court favorites in goods or businesses which had
long before been enjoyed by the public. Graham v.
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 5, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15
L.Ed.2d 545 (1966) (citing Peter Meinhardt, Inventions,
Patents and Monopoly 30-35 (1946)). The
Statute of Monopolies outlawed these odious
monopolies or favors of the Crown, but, contrary
to the concurring opinion, the Statute had nothing
whatever to do with narrowing or eliminating categories
of inventive subject matter eligible for a
British patent. See Prager, Historical Background
and Foundation of American Patent Law, 5 Am. J.
Legal Hist. at 313 (The statute [of Monopolies]
said nothing about meritorious *986 functions of
patents, nothing about patent disclosures, and nothing
about patent procedures; it was only directed
against patent abuses.).
Patents for inventions had been granted by the
Crown long before 1623. See Hulme, The History
of the Patent System Under the Prerogative and at
Common Law, 12 L.Q. Rev. at 143 (the first patent
grant to the introducer of a newly-invented process
was in 1440); Klitzke, Historical Background
of the English Patent Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 626-27
(discussing first patents for invention in England
in the fifteenth century). That practice was unaffected
by the terms of the Statute of Monopolies,
which rendered utterly void all Monopolies and
all Commissions, Grants, Licenses, Charters and
Letters Patent that were directed to the sole Buying,
Selling, Making, Working or Using any Thing
within this Realm, 21 Jac. 1, c.3,  I (Eng.), but
which specifically excepted Letters Patent for inventions
from that exclusion, id.  VI. The only
new limitation on patents for invention was a four-
teen-year limit on the term of exclusivity. See
Klitzke, Historical Background of the English Patent
Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 649.
The usage Letters Patent described one of the
forms of document whereby the Crown granted
various rights, whether the grant was for an odious
monopoly that the Statute of Monopolies eliminated,
or for rights to an invention new to England.
That usage was not changed by the Statute of
Monopolies. Nor were other aspects of the British
practice which differed from that enacted in the
United States, particularly the aspect whereby a
British patent could be granted to a person who imported
something that was new to England, whether
or not the import was previously known or the importer
was the inventor thereof. In England, [t]he
rights of the inventor are derived from those of the
importer, and not vice versa as is commonly supposed.
Hulme, The History of the Patent System
Under the Prerogative and at Common Law, 12
L.Q.R. at 152; see also MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial
Revolution 13 (The rights of the first inventor
were understood to derive from those of the
first importer of the invention.).
In contrast, in the United States the patent right
has never been predicated upon importation, and
has never been limited to manufactures. See, e.g.,
Walterscheid, To Promote the Progress of Useful
Arts 93, 137-38, 224; see also Prager, Historic
Background and Foundation of American Patent
Law, 5 Am. J. Legal Hist. at 309 (The American
Revolution destroyed many of the ancient customs;
it brought a sweeping reorientation of patent law,
with new forms, new rules, new concepts, and new
ideals.). The differences between the American
and English patent law at this nation's founding
were marked, and English judicial decisions inter

preting the English statute are of limited use in interpreting
the United States statute. In all events, no
English decision supports this court's new restrictive
definition of process.
The concurrence proposes that the Statute of
Monopolies provides a binding definition of the
terms manufacture, machine, composition of
matter, and process in Section 101 of the U.S.
Patent Act. See concurring op. at 968-70. The only
one of these terms that appears in the Statute of
Monopolies is manufacture, a broad term that reflects
the usage of the period. Even at the time of
this country's founding, the usage was broad, as set
forth in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English
Language (3d. ed. 1768), which defines
manufacture as any thing made by art, and
defines *987 art as the power of doing
something not taught by nature and instinct; a
science; a trade; artfulness; skill;
dexterity. Historians explain that England's
primary motive for patenting was to promote
[a]cquisition of superior Continental technology
at a time when England lagged behind, see
MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial Revolution 11;
this cannot be interpreted to mean that England and
perforce the United States intended to eliminate
processes from this incentive system. It is inconceivable
that on this background the Framers, and
again the enactors of the first United States patent
statutes in 1790 and 1793, intended sub silentio to
impose the limitations on process now created by
this court.
Congress' earliest known draft patent bill included
the terms art, manufacture, engine, machine,
invention or device, or any improvement
upon the same. Walterscheid, To Promote the Progress
of Useful Arts 92. The 1793 Act explicitly
stated any new and useful art,  1, 1 Stat. 318
(1793), a usage that was carried forward until art
was replaced with process in 35 U.S.C.  101 and
defined in  100(b). Historians discuss that Congress'
inclusion of any art or process in the patent
system was a deliberate clarification of the Eng
lish practice. See Walterscheid, To Promote the
Progress of Useful Arts 93 ([The first patent bill]
appears to be an obvious attempt to deal legislatively
with issues that were beginning to be addressed
by the English courts.... [I]t states unequivocally
that improvement inventions are patentable
and expands the definition of invention or discovery
beyond simply manufacture. ); Karl B. Lutz,
Patents and Science: A Clarification of the Patent
Clause of the U.S. Constitution, 32 J.P.O.S. 83, 86
(1950) ( By the year 1787 it was being recognized
even in Great Britain that the phrase new manufactures'
was an unduly limited object for a patent system,
since it seems to exclude new processes....
[This question was] resolved in the United States
Constitution by broadening the field from new
manufactures' to useful arts'....).
In interpreting a statute, it is the language selected
by Congress that occupies center stage:
[O]ur obligation is to take statutes as we find
them, guided, if ambiguity appears, by the legislative
history and statutory purpose. Chakrabarty,
447 U.S. at 315, 100 S.Ct. 2204. The Court has
perceive[d] no ambiguity in Section 101, leaving
no need for foreign assistance. Id. The legislative
choice to afford the patent system wide scope, id.
at 308, 100 S.Ct. 2204, including process inventions,
evolved in the United States independent of
later developments of the common law in England.
The concurrence concludes that the Statute of
Monopolies foreclosed the future patenting of anything
that the concurrence calls a business method-
the term is not defined-whether or not the
method is new, inventive, and useful. But the Statute
of Monopolies only foreclosed odious monopolies,
illustrated by historical reports that Queen
Elizabeth had granted monopolies on salt, ale, saltpeter,
white soap, dredging machines, playing
cards, and rape seed oil, and on processes and services
such as Spanish leather-making, mining of
various metals and ores, dying and dressing cloth,
and iron tempering. See Walterscheid, Early Evolution

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
Historical Background of the English Patent Law,
41 J.P.O.S. at 634-35. These and other grants, many
of which were implemented by Letters Patent, were
the odious monopolies that were rendered illegal.
They included several classes of known activity,
product and process, and had nothing to do with
new inventions. *988 The Statute of Monopolies
cannot be held to have restricted the kinds of new
processes that can today be eligible for patenting in
the United States, merely because it outlawed patents
on non-novel businesses in England. The presence
or absence of organizing human activity, a
vague term created by the concurrence, has no connection
or relevance to Parliament's elimination of
monopoly patronage grants for old, established arts.
The Statute of Monopolies neither excluded nor included
inventions that involve human activity, although
the words the sole working or making in
any manner of new manufactures presuppose human
activity. 21 Jac. 1, c.3,  VI (emphases added).
We are directed to no authority for the proposition
that a new and inventive process involving human
activity has historically been treated differently
from other processes; indeed, most inventions involve
human activity.
The concurrence has provided hints of the complexity
of the evolution of patent law in England, as
in the United States, as the Industrial Revolution
took hold. Historians have recognized these complexities.
See, e.g., Walterscheid, To Promote the
Progress of Useful Arts 5 ([T]he American patent
law almost from its inception departed from its
common law counterpart in the interpretation that
would be given to the definition of novelty....);
Klitzke, Historical Background of the English Patent
Law, 41 J.P.O.S. at 638 (noting that in Elizabethan
times, novelty only required a showing that
the industry had not been carried on within the
realm within a reasonable period of time, while
today the proof of a single public sale of an article
or a printed publication can negate patentability).
I caution against over-simplification, particu
larly in view of the uncertainties in English common
law at the time of this country's founding. See
Boulton v. Bull, 2 H. Bl. 463, 491 (C.P.1795) (Eyre,
C.J.) (Patent rights are no where that I can find accurately
discussed in our books.); MacLeod, Inventing
the Industrial Revolution 61 (It was only
from the time when the Privy Council relinquished
jurisdiction that a case law on patents began to develop....
But it was a slow process and even the
spate of hard-fought patent cases at the end of the
eighteenth century did little to establish a solid core
of judicial wisdom.). The English judicial opinions
of the eighteenth century were not as limiting on
the United States as my colleagues suggest. See
Walterscheid, The Nature of the Intellectual Property
Clause: A Study in Historical Perspective 355
(2002) (In the eighteenth century, patentees and
those who gave advice concerning patents were certainly
of the view that the Statute did not preclude
the patenting of general principles of operation.);
see also MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial Revolution
63-64.
It is reported that in the century and a half following
enactment of the Statute of Monopolies, the
English patent registers were replete with inventions
claimed as processes. See Walterscheid,
Early Evolution (Part 3), 77 J.P.T.O.S. at 856 (As
one of the earliest texts on the patent law stated in
1806: most of the patents now taken out, are by
name, for the method of doing particular
things....). The concurrence agrees; but it is also
reported that because patents were not litigated in
the common law courts until the Privy Council authorized
such suits in 1752, judicial interpretation
of various aspects of patent law were essentially absent
until about the time this country achieved independence,
leading to the variety of views expressed
in Boulton v. Bull. The legislators in the new
United States cannot now be assigned the straight-
jacket of law not yet developed in England. Indeed,
the *989 first patent granted by President Washington,
upon examination by Secretary of State Jefferson,
was for a method of making Pot-ash and
Pearl-ash, a process patent granted during the peri

od that the concurrence states was fraught with
English uncertainty about process patents. See The
First United States Patent, 36 J.P.O.S. 615, 616-17
(1954).
The concurrence lists some English process
patents predating the United States' 1793 Patent
Act, and argues that processes not sufficiently
like these archaic inventions should not now be
eligible for patenting. I refer simply to Flook, 437
U.S. at 588 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2522, where the Court
stated: As in Benson, we assume that a valid process
patent may issue even if it does not meet one
of the qualifications of our earlier precedents.
Similarly, the Chakrabarty Court stated: [A] statute
is not to be confined to the particular applications
... contemplated by the legislators. This is especially
true in the field of patent law. Chakrabarty,
447 U.S. at 315-16, 100 S.Ct. 2204 (citing
Barr v. United States, 324 U.S. 83, 90, 65 S.Ct.
522, 89 L.Ed. 765 (1945); Browder v. United
States, 312 U.S. 335, 339, 61 S.Ct. 599, 85 L.Ed.
862 (1941); Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., 302 U.S. 253,
257, 58 S.Ct. 167, 82 L.Ed. 235 (1937)). The meaning
of the statutory term process is not limited by
particular examples from more than two hundred
years ago.
However, I cannot resist pointing to the
business method patents on Woodcroft's list. See
concurring op. at 973 (citing No. 1197 to John
Knox (July 21, 1778) (Plan for assurances on lives
of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.)). Several
other process patents on Woodcroft's list appear to
involve financial subject matter, and to require
primarily human activity. See, e.g., No. 1170 to
John Molesworth (Sept. 29, 1777) (Securing to the
purchasers of shares and chances of state-lottery
tickets any prize drawn in their favor.); No. 1159
to William Nicholson (July 14, 1777) (Securing
the property of persons purchasing shares of State-
lottery tickets.), cited in Bennet Woodcroft, Alphabetical
Index of Patentees of Inventions 383,
410 (U.S. ed.1969). Other English process patents
from the several decades following 1793 can aptly
be described as business methods, although not
performed with the aid of computers. E.g., No.
10,367 to George Robert D'Harcourt (Oct. 29,
1844) (Ascertaining and checking the number of
checks or tickets which have been used and
marked, applicable for railway officers.).
While most patents of an earlier era reflect the
dominant mechanical and chemical technologies of
that era, modern processes reflect the dramatic advances
in telecommunications and computing that
have occurred since the time of George III. See
USPTO White Paper, Automated Financial or Management
Data Processing Methods (Business Methods)
4 (2000), available at http:// www. uspto. gov/
web/ menu/ busmethp/ whitepaper. pdf (hereinafter
USPTO White Paper) (The full arrival of electricity
as a component in business data processing
system[s] was a watershed event.). It is apparent
that economic, or business method, or human
activity patents were neither explicitly nor implicitly
foreclosed from access to the English patent
system.
Evolution of process patents in the United States
The United States' history of patenting establishes
the same point. The PTO has located various
patents predating modern computer usages that can
be described as financial or business methods. The
USPTO White Paper at 3-4 and appendix A describes
the history of financial apparatus and method
patents dating back to 1799, including patents on
bank notes, bills of *990 credit, bills of exchange,
check blanks, detecting and preventing counterfeiting,
coin counting, interest calculation tables, and
lotteries, all within the first fifty years of the United
States patent system. It is a distortion of these patents
to describe the processes as tied to another
statutory category-that is, paper and pencil. Concurring
op. at 974-75 & n. 18. Replacement of paper
with a computer screen, and pencil with electrons,
does not untie the process. Fairly considered, the
many older financial and business-oriented patents
that the PTO and many of the amici have identified
are of the same type as the Bilski claims; they were

surely not rendered patent-eligible solely because
they used paper to instantiate the financial
strategies and transactions that comprised their contribution.
I do not disagree with the general suggestion
that statutes intended to codify the existing common
law are to be interpreted in light of then-
contemporary practice, including, if relevant, the
English cases. See concurring op. at 972-73.
However, the court must be scrupulous in assessing
the relevance of decisions that were formulated on
particularized facts involving the technology of the
period. The United States Supreme Court has never
held that process inventions suffered a second-
class status under our statutes, achieving patent eligibility
only derivatively through an explicit tie
to another statutory category. The Court has repeatedly
disparaged efforts to read in restrictions
not based on statutory language. See Diehr, 450
U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048; Chakrabarty, 447 U.S.
at 308, 100 S.Ct. 2204. Yet second-class status is
today engrafted on process inventions. There is
plainly no basis for such restriction, which is a direct
path to the gloomy thought that concerned
Senator O.H. Platt in his Remarks in Congress at
the Centennial Proceedings of the United States
Patent System:
For one, I cannot entertain the gloomy thought
that we have come to that century in the world's
life in which new and grander achievements are
impossible.... Invention is a prolific mother;
every inventive triumph stimulates new effort.
Man never is and never will be content with success,
and the great secrets of nature are as yet
largely undiscovered.

of Proceedings and Addresses: Celebration of
the Beginning of the Second Century of the American
Patent System 75-76 (1990).
In sum, history does not support the retrogression
sponsored by the concurrence.
This court now rejects its own CCPA and Federal
Circuit precedent
The majority opinion holds that there is a Supreme
Court restriction on process patents,
enunciated in Benson, Flook, and Diehr; and that
this restriction was improperly ignored by the Federal
Circuit and the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals, leading us into error which we must now
correct. Thus this court announces that our prior decisions
may no longer be relied upon. Maj. op. at
959-60 & nn. 17, 19. The effect on the patents and
businesses that did rely on them is not considered.
The Court's decisions in Benson, Flook, and
Diehr all reached the Supreme Court by way of the
CCPA, and the CCPA successively implemented
the Court's guidance in establishing the Freeman/
Walter/ Abele test for eligibility under Section 101.
The Federal Circuit continued to consider computer-
facilitated processes, as in Arrhythmia Research
Technology, 958 F.2d at 1059-60, where
patent-eligibility was confirmed for a computer-assisted
*991 mathematical analysis of electrocardiograph
signals that determined the likelihood of recurrence
of heart attack. This court now rules that
this precedent should no longer be relied on. Maj.
op. at 959 n. 17.
In In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed.Cir.1994) (
en banc ) the question was the eligibility for patent
of a rasterizer that mathematically transforms data
to eliminate aliasing in a digital oscilloscope. The
court held that a computer-implemented system that
produces a useful, concrete, and tangible result is
Section 101 subject matter. Id. at 1544. This court
now rules that a useful, concrete and tangible result
analysis should no longer be relied on. Maj.
op. at 960 n. 19.
The Alappat court stressed the intent, embodied
in the language of the statute, that the patent system
be broadly available to new and useful inventions:
The use of the expansive term any in  101 represents
Congress's intent not to place any restrictions
on the subject matter for which a patent

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
may be obtained beyond those specifically recited
in  101 and other parts of Title 35.
33 F.3d at 1542. This court looked to the Supreme
Court's guidance in its Section 101 decisions,
and explained:
A close analysis of Diehr, Flook, and Benson re
veals that the Supreme Court never intended to
create an overly broad, fourth category of
[mathematical] subject matter excluded from
101. Rather, at the core of the Court's analysis in
each of these cases lies an attempt by the Court to
explain a rather straightforward concept, namely,
that certain types of mathematical subject matter,
standing alone, represent nothing more than abstract
ideas until reduced to some type of practical
application, and thus that subject matter is not,
in and of itself, entitled to patent protection.
Id. at 1543 (emphasis in original). The court
cited the Supreme Court's distinction between abstract
ideas and their practical application, and
stated of the claimed rasterizer: This is not a disembodied
mathematical concept which may be
characterized as an abstract idea, but rather a specific
machine to produce a useful, concrete, and
tangible result. Id. at 1544.
This principle was applied to a computer-
implemented data processing system for managing
pooled mutual fund assets in State Street Bank &
Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1998), and to a method for recording
and processing telephone data in AT & T v.
Excel. The court explained that processes that include
mathematical calculations in a practical application
can produce a useful, concrete, and tangible
result, which in State Street Bank was
expressed in numbers, such as price, profit, percentage,
cost, or loss. 149 F.3d at 1375. In AT & T
v. Excel the court applied State Street Bank and
Diehr, and stated that physical transformation ... is
not an invariable requirement, but merely one example
of how a mathematical algorithm may bring
about a useful application and thus achieve a useful,
concrete, and tangible result. 172 F.3d at 1358.
This analysis, too, can no longer be relied on. Maj.
op. at 960 n. 19.
The now-discarded criterion of a useful, concrete,
and tangible result has proved to be of ready
and comprehensible applicability in a large variety
of processes of the information and digital ages.
The court in State Street Bank reinforced the thesis
that there is no reason, in statute or policy, to exclude
computer-implemented and information-
based inventions from access to patentability. The
holdings and reasoning of Alappat and State Street
Bank guided *992 the inventions of the electronic
age into the patent system, while remaining faithful
to the Diehr distinction between abstract ideas such
as mathematical formulae and their application in a
particular process for a specified purpose. And patentability
has always required compliance with all
of the requirements of the statute, including novelty,
non-obviousness, utility, and the provisions of
Section 112.
The public has relied on the rulings of this court
and of the Supreme Court
The decisions in Alappat and State Street Bank
confirmed the patent eligibility of many evolving
areas of commerce, as inventors and investors explored
new technological capabilities. The public
and the economy have experienced extraordinary
advances in information-based and computer-managed
processes, supported by an enlarging patent
base. The PTO reports that in Class 705, the examination
classification associated with business
methods and most likely to receive inventions that
may not use machinery or transform physical matter,
there were almost 10,000 patent applications
filed in FY 2006 alone, and over 40,000 applications
filed since FY 98 when State Street Bank was
decided. See Wynn W. Coggins, USPTO, Update
on Business Methods for the Business Methods

Report ), available at http:// www. uspto. gov/

Stable law, on which industry can rely, is a
foundation of commercial advance into new
products and processes. Inventiveness in the computer
and information services fields has placed the
United States in a position of technological and
commercial preeminence. The information technology
industry is reported to be the key factor responsible
for reversing the 20-year productivity
slow-down from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s
and in driving today's robust productivity growth.

in 2006 stated:
As recently as 1978, intangible assets, such as intellectual
property, accounted for 20 percent of
corporate assets with the vast majority of value
(80 percent) attributed to tangible assets such as
facilities and equipment. By 1997, the trend reversed;
73 percent of corporate assets were intangible
and only 27 percent were tangible.
H.R.Rep. No. 109-673 (accompanying a bill
concerning judicial resources).
This powerful economic move toward
intangibles is a challenge to the backward-looking
change of this court's ruling *993 today. Until
the shift represented by today's decision, statute and
precedent have provided stability in the rapidly
moving and commercially vibrant fields of the Information
Age. Despite the economic importance of
these interests, the consequences of our decision
have not been considered. I don't know how much
human creativity and commercial activity will be
devalued by today's change in law; but neither do
my colleagues.
The Section 101 interpretation that is now uprooted
has the authority of years of reliance, and
ought not be disturbed absent the most compelling
reasons. Considerations of stare decisis have special
force in the area of statutory interpretation, for
here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation,
the legislative power is implicated, and
Congress remains free to alter what [the courts]
have done. Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13,
23, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)
(quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491
U.S. 164, 172-73, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132
(1989)); see also Hilton v. S.C. Pub. Railways
Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 205, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116
L.Ed.2d 560 (1991) (in cases of statutory interpretation
the importance of adhering to prior rulings is
most compelling). Where, as here, Congress has
not acted to modify the statute in the many years
since Diehr and the decisions of this court, the
force of stare decisis is even stronger. See Shepard,
544 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254.
Adherence to settled law, resulting in settled
expectations, is of particular importance in cases
involving property and contract rights, where reliance
interests are involved. Payne v. Tennessee,
501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d

where prior ruling has become a rule of property,
and to disturb it now would be fraught with many
injurious results). This rationale is given no weight
by my colleagues, as this court gratuitously disrupts
decades of law underlying our own rulings. The
only announced support for today's change appears
to be the strained new reading of Supreme Court
quotations. But this court has previously read these
decades-old opinions differently, without objection
by either Congress or the Court. My colleagues do
not state a reason for their change of heart. See
Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process 149 (1921) ([T]he labor of judges would
be increased almost to the breaking point if every
past decision could be reopened in every case, and
one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the
secure foundation of the courses laid by others who
had gone before him.).
It is the legislature's role to change the law if
the public interest so requires. In Chakrabarty the
Court stated: The choice we are urged to make is a
matter of high policy for resolution within the legislative
process after the kind of investigation, examination,
and study that legislative bodies can
provide and courts cannot. 447 U.S. at 317, 100
S.Ct. 2204; see also Flook, 437 U.S. at 595, 98
S.Ct. 2522 (Difficult questions of policy concerning
the kinds of programs that may be appropriate
for patent protection and the form and duration of
such protection can be answered by Congress on
the basis of current empirical data not equally available
to this tribunal.).
It is, however, the judicial obligation to assure
a correct, just, and reliable judicial process, and
particularly to respect the principles of stare decisis
in an area in which prior and repeated statutory interpretations
have been relied upon by others. See,
e.g., *994Shepard, 544 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254
([T]he claim to adhere to case law is generally
powerful once a decision has settled statutory
meaning.); Hilton, 502 U.S. at 202, 112 S.Ct. 560
(Adherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability,
and respect for judicial authority.);
Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (Stare decisis
is the preferred course because it promotes the
evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development
of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial
decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived
integrity of the judicial process.). These
considerations appear to be abandoned.
Uncertain guidance for the future
Not only past expectations, but future hopes,
are disrupted by uncertainty as to application of the
new restrictions on patent eligibility. For example,
the court states that even if a process is tied to a
machine or transforms matter, the machine or transformation
must impose meaningful limits and
cannot constitute insignificant extra-solution activity.
Maj. op. at 961-62. We are advised that transformation
must be central to the purpose of the
claimed process, id., although we are not told what
kinds of transformations may qualify, id. at 962-63.
These concepts raise new conflicts with precedent.
This court and the Supreme Court have stated
that there is no legally recognizable or protected
essential element, gist or heart of the invention
in a combination patent. Allen Eng'g Corp. v. Bar-
tell Industries, Inc., 299 F.3d 1336, 1345
(Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible
Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 345, 81
S.Ct. 599, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961)). This rule applies
with equal force to process patents, see W.L. Gore
& Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F.2d 1540,
1548 (Fed.Cir.1983) (there is no gist of the invention
rule for process patents), and is in accord with
the rule that the invention must be considered as a
whole, rather than dissected, in assessing its patent
eligibility under Section 101, see Diehr, 450
U.S. at 188, 101 S.Ct. 1048. It is difficult to predict
an adjudicator's view of the invention as a whole,
now that patent examiners and judges are instructed
to weigh the different process components for their
centrality and the significance of their
extra-solution activity in a Section 101 inquiry.
As for whether machine implementation will
impose meaningful limits in a particular case, the

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 50
545 F.3d 943, 2008-2 USTC P 50,621, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 943)
meaningfulness of computer usage in the great
variety of technical and informational subject matter
that is computer-facilitated is apparently now a
flexible parameter of Section 101. Each patent examination
center, each trial court, each panel of this
court, will have a blank slate on which to uphold or
invalidate claims based on whether there are sufficient
meaningful limits, or whether a transformation
is adequately central, or the significance of
process steps. These qualifiers, appended to a novel
test which itself is neither suggested nor supported
by statutory text, legislative history, or judicial precedent,
raise more questions than they answer.
These new standards add delay, uncertainty, and
cost, but do not add confidence in reliable standards
for Section 101.
Other aspects of the changes of law also contribute
uncertainty. We aren't told when, or if, software
instructions implemented on a general purpose
computer are deemed tied to a particular machine,
for if Alappat's guidance that software converts
a general purpose computer into a special purpose
machine remains applicable, there is no need
for the present ruling. For the thousands of inventors
who obtained patents under the court's nowdiscarded*
995 criteria, their property rights are
now vulnerable.
The court also avoids saying whether the State
Street Bank and AT & T v. Excel inventions would
pass the new test. The drafting of claims in machine
or process form was not determinative in those
cases, for we consider the scope of  101 to be the
same regardless of the form-machine or process-in
which a particular claim is drafted. AT & T v. Excel,
172 F.3d at 1357. From either the machine or
the transformation viewpoint, the processing of data
representing price, profit, percentage, cost, or
loss in State Street Bank is not materially different
from the processing of the Bilski data representing
commodity purchase and sale prices, market transactions,
and risk positions; yet Bilski is held to fail
our new test, while State Street is left hanging. The
uncertainty is illustrated in the contemporaneous
decision of In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 1365, 1378-79
(Fed.Cir.2007), where the court held that systems
that depend for their operation on human intelligence
alone to solve practical problems are not
within the scope of Section 101; and In re Nuijten,
500 F.3d 1346, 1353-54 (Fed.Cir.2007), where the
court held that claims to a signal with an embedded
digital watermark encoded according to a given encoding
process were not directed to statutory subject
matter under Section 101, although the claims
included physical but transitory forms of signal
transmission such as radio broadcasts, electrical
signals through a wire, and light pluses through a
fiber-optic cable.
Although this uncertainty may invite some to
try their luck in court, the wider effect will be a disincentive
to innovation-based commerce. For inventors,
investors, competitors, and the public, the
most grievous consequence is the effect on inventions
not made or not developed because of uncertainty
as to patent protection. Only the successes
need the patent right.
The Bilski invention has not been examined for
patentability
To be patentable, Bilski's invention must be
novel and non-obvious, and the specification and
claims must meet the requirements of enablement,
description, specificity, best mode, etc. See 35
U.S.C.  101 (Whoever invents or discovers a new
and useful process ... may obtain a patent therefor,
subject to the conditions and requirements of this
title.); Diehr, 450 U.S. at 190, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (the
question of whether an invention is novel is distinct
from whether the subject matter is statutory); State
Street Bank, 149 F.3d at 1377 (Whether the patent's
claims are too broad to be patentable is not to
be judged under  101, but rather under  102, 103
, and 112.). I don't know whether Bilski can meet
these requirements-but neither does this court, for
the claims have not been examined for patentability,
and no rejections apart from Section 101 are included
in this appeal.
Instead, the court states the true issue before

us is whether Applicants are seeking to claim a
fundamental principle (such as an abstract idea) or
mental process, maj. op. at 952, and answers
yes. With respect, that is the wrong question, and
the wrong answer. Bilski's patent application describes
his process of analyzing the effects of supply
and demand on commodity prices and the use
of a coupled transaction strategy to hedge against
these risks; this is not a fundamental principle or an
abstract idea; it is not a mental process or a law of
nature. It is a process, set out in successive steps,
for obtaining and analyzing information and carrying
out a series of commercial transactions for the
purpose of managing the consumption risk costs of
a commodity *996 sold by a commodity provider at
a fixed price. Claim 1, preamble.
Because the process Bilski describes employs
complex mathematical calculations to assess various
elements of risk, any practicable embodiment
would be conducted with the aid of a machine-a
programmed computer-but the court holds that
since computer-implementation is not recited in
claim 1, for that reason alone the process fails the
machine part of the court's machine-
or-transformation test. Maj. op. at 962. And the
court holds that since Bilski's process involves the
processing of data concerning commodity prices
and supply and demand and other risk factors, the
process fails the transformation test because no
physical objects or substances are transformed.
Maj. op. at 963-64. The court then concludes that
because Bilski's Claim 1 fails the machine-
or-transformation test it ipso facto preempts a
fundamental principle and is thereby barred from
the patent system under Section 101: an illogical
leap that displays the flaws in the court's analysis.
If a claim is unduly broad, or if it fails to include
sufficient specificity, the appropriate ground
of rejection is Section 112, for claims must
particularly point out and distinctly claim[ ] the
invention. See In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 495-96
(Fed.Cir.1991) (affirming rejection under Section
112 where [t]here is no reasonable correlation
between the narrow disclosure in applicant's specification
and the broad scope of protection sought
in the claims); In re Foster, 58 C.C.P.A. 1001, 438
F.2d 1011, 1016 (1971) (claims not commensurate
with appellants' own definition of what they are
seeking to cover are rejected under Section 112,
rather than Section 101); In re Prater, 415 F.2d at
1403-04 (applying Section 112 to claims that included
mental steps). The filing of a broader claim
than is supported in the specification does not convert
the invention into an abstraction and evict the
application from eligibility for examination. A
broad first claim in a patent application is routine; it
is not the crisis event postulated in the court's opinion.
The role of examination is to determine the
scope of the claims to which the applicant is entitled.
See 37 C.F.R.  1.104(a). The PTO's regulations
provide:
On taking up an application for examination or a
patent in a reexamination proceeding, the examiner
shall make a thorough study thereof and
shall make a thorough investigation of the available
prior art relating to the subject matter of the
claimed invention. The examination shall be
complete with respect to both compliance of the
application or patent under reexamination with
the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability
of the invention as claimed, as well as
with respect to matters of form, unless otherwise
indicated.
Id.  1.104(a)(1). The Manual of Patent Examining
Procedure (MPEP) similarly instructs the
examiners to conduct a thorough search of the prior
art before evaluating the invention under Section
101. MPEP  2106(III) (8th ed., rev.7, July.
2008) (Prior to evaluating the claimed invention
under 35 U.S.C.  101, USPTO personnel are expected
to conduct a thorough search of the prior
art.). The MPEP also requires examiners to identify
all grounds of rejection in the first official PTO
action to avoid unnecessary delays in examination.

prosecution, each claim should be reviewed for
compliance with every statutory requirement for
patentability in the initial review of the application,
even if one or more claims are found to be deficient
with respect to some statutory requirement.). I
note that this *997 requirement does not appear to
have been here met.
Several amici curiae referred to the difficulties
that the PTO has reported in examining patents in
areas where the practice has been to preserve
secrecy, for published prior art is sparse. The Federal
Trade Commission recognized that the problem
of questionable patents stems mostly from the
difficulty patent examiners can have in considering
all the relevant prior art in the field and staying informed
about the rapid advance of computer science.
FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper
Balance of Competition & Patent Law and Policy at
ch. 3, pp. 44 (Oct.2003), available at http:// www.
ftc. gov/ os/ 2003/ 10/ innovationrpt. pdf. However,
this problem seems to be remedied, for the PTO reported
in 2007 that for Class 705, [t]he cases the
examiners are now working on have noticeably narrower
claims than the cases filed in or before FY
2000. PTO Report at 9. The PTO reports that its
search fields have been enlarged, staff added, and
supervision augmented. FTC Report at ch. 1, p. 30.
(Since the PTO introduced [these changes] the allowance
rate for business method patents has decreased,
and the PTO believes that this decreased
allowance rate indicates improved PTO searches for
prior art.). If this court's purpose now is to improve
the quality of issued patents by eliminating
access to patenting for large classes of past,
present, and future inventions, the remedy would
appear to be excessive.
A straightforward, efficient, and ultimately fair
approach to the evaluation of new and useful processes-
quoting Section 101-is to recognize that a
process invention that is not clearly a fundamental
truth, law of nature, or abstract idea is eligible for
examination for patentability. I do not suggest that
basic scientific discoveries are a proper subject
matter of patents (the Court in Chakrabarty men
2
tioned E=mc and the law of gravity), and I do not
attempt an all-purpose definition of the boundary
between scientific theory and technological application.
But it is rare indeed that a question arises at
the boundary of basic science; more usual is the
situation illustrated by Samuel Morse's telegraph, in
which the Court simply held that Morse's general
claim was too broad, exceeding the scope of his
practical application.
Bilski's process for determining risk in commodity
transactions does not become an abstraction
because it is broadly claimed in his first claim. It
may be claimed so broadly that it reads on the prior
art, but it is neither a fundamental truth nor an abstraction.
Bilski's ten other claims contain further
details and limitations, removing them farther from
abstraction. Although claim 1 may have been
deemed representative with respect to Section
101, the differences among the claims may be significant
with respect to Sections 102, 103, and 112.
Bilski's application, now pending for eleven years,
has yet to be examined for patentability.
CONCLUSION
In sum, the text of Section 101, its statutory
history, its interpretation by the Supreme Court,
and its application by the courts, contravene this
court's redefinition of the statutory term process.
The court's decision affects present and future
rights and incentives, and usurps the legislative
role. The judicial role is to support stability and
predictability in the law, with fidelity to statute and
precedent, and respect for the principles of stare
decisis.
Patents provide an incentive to invest in and
work in new directions. In United States v. Line
Material Co., 333 U.S. 287, 332, 68 S.Ct. 550, 92
L.Ed. 701 (1948), Justice Burton, joined by Chief
Justice *998 Vinson and Justice Frankfurter, remarked
that the frontiers of science have expanded
until civilization now depends largely upon discoveries
on those frontiers to meet the infinite needs of
the future. The United States, thus far, has taken a

leading part in making those discoveries and in putting
them to use. This remains true today. It is antithetical
to this incentive to restrict eligibility for
patenting to what has been done in the past, and to
foreclose what might be done in the future.
MAYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
The en banc order in this case asked: Whether
it is appropriate to reconsider State Street Bank &
Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149
F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1998), and AT&T Corp.v.Excel
Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d 1352
(Fed.Cir.1999), in this case and, if so, whether
those cases should be overruled in any respect? I
would answer that question with an emphatic yes.
The patent system is intended to protect and promote
advances in science and technology, not ideas
about how to structure commercial transactions.
Claim 1 of the application of Bernard L. Bilski and
Rand A. Warsaw (Bilski) is not eligible for patent
protection because it is directed to a method of conducting
business. Affording patent protection to
business methods lacks constitutional and statutory
support, serves to hinder rather than promote innovation
and usurps that which rightfully belongs in
the public domain. State Street and AT & T should
be overruled.
I.
In discussing the scope of copyright protection,
the Supreme Court has noted that  a page of history
is worth a volume of logic.  Eldred v. Ashcroft,
537 U.S. 186, 200, 123 S.Ct. 769, 154
L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) (quoting New York Trust Co. v.
Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.Ct. 506, 65 L.Ed.
963 (1921)). The same holds true with respect to
patent protection. From a historical perspective, it
is highly unlikely that the framers of the Constitution's
intellectual property clause intended to grant
patent protection to methods of conducting business.
To the contrary, those who formulated the
Constitution were familiar with the long struggle
over monopolies so prominent in English history,
where exclusive rights to engage even in ordinary
business activities were granted so frequently by
the Crown for the financial benefits accruing to the
Crown only. In re Yuan, 38 C.C.P.A. 967, 188
F.2d 377, 380 (1951). The Statute of Monopolies,
FN1
enacted in 1624, curtailed the Crown's ability
to grant monopolies to court favorites in goods or
businesses which had long before been enjoyed by
the public. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1,
5, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). When
drafting the Constitution, the framers were well
aware of the abuses that led to the English Statute
of Monopolies and therefore consciously acted to
bar Congress from granting letters patent in particular
types of business. In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d
1365, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2007); see also Malla Pollack,

generation did not agree to invention patents
on advances in *999 trade itself, because trade
monopolies were odious.).
FN1. The Statute of Monopolies grew out
of abuses in the grant of exclusive franchises
in various lines of business such as
trading cards, alehouses and various staple
products. Robert P. Merges, As Many as

There is nothing in the early patent statutes to
indicate that Congress intended business methods
to constitute patentable subject matter. See Patent
Act of 1790  4, 1 Stat. 109, 111 (1790); Patent Act
of 1793  1, 1 Stat. 318, 319 (1793); Pollack, supra
at 106 ([I]f any nation was ripe for invention patents
on business methods, it was the newly freed
colonies of British North America.... [H]owever, no
business method patents seem to have been granted.).
As early as 1869, the Commissioner of Patents
said that [i]t is contrary ... to the spirit of the
law, as construed by the office for many years, to
grant patents for methods of book-keeping, Ex

In passing the 1952 Act, Congress re-enacted
FN2
statutory language that had long existed,thus
signaling its intent to carry forward the body of
case law that had developed under prior versions of
the statute. Because there is nothing in the language
of the 1952 Act, or its legislative history, to indicate
that Congress intended to modify the rule
against patenting business methods, we must presume
that no change in the rule was intended. See,
e.g., Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino,
501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96
(1991) ([W]here a common-law principle is well
established ... the courts may take it as given that
Congress has legislated with an expectation that the
principle will apply except when a statutory purpose
to the contrary is evident. (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted)); Isbrandtsen Co. v.
Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783, 72 S.Ct. 1011, 96
L.Ed. 1294 (1952) (Statutes which invade the
common law ... are to be read with a presumption
favoring the retention of long-established *1000
and familiar principles, except when a statutory
purpose to the contrary is evident.); see also In re
Schrader, 22 F.3d 290, 295 (Fed.Cir.1994) (When
Congress approved the addition of the term
process' to the categories of patentable subject
matter in 1952, it incorporated the definition of
process' that had evolved in the courts. (footnote
omitted)). If Congress had wished to change the established
practice of disallowing patents on business
methods, it was quite capable of doing so explicitly.
See Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 596, 98
S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978) (stressing that
courts must proceed cautiously when ... asked to
extend patent rights into areas wholly unforeseen
by Congress).
FN2. Congress did substitute the word
process for art in the 1952 Act, but
[a]nalysis of the eligibility of a claim of
patent protection for a process' did not
change with the addition of that term to
101. Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175,
184, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155
(1981).
State Street's decision to jettison the prohibition
against patenting methods of doing business
contravenes congressional intent. Because (1) the
framers consciously acted to bar Congress from
granting letters patent in particular types of business,
Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1375, and (2) Congress
evidenced no intent to modify the long-
established rule against business method patents

fathom how the issuance of patents on business
methods can be supported.
II.
Business method patents have been justified, in
significant measure, by a misapprehension of the
legislative history of the 1952 Patent Act. In particular,
proponents of such patents have asserted that
the Act's legislative history states that Congress intended
statutory subject matter to include anything
under the sun that is made by man. AT & T, 172
F.3d at 1355 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Diamond v.
Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65
L.Ed.2d 144 (1980). Read in context, however, the
legislative history says no such thing. The full
statement from the committee report reads: A person
may have invented a machine or a manufacture,
which may include anything under the sun that
is made by man, but it is not necessarily patentable
under section 101 unless the conditions of the title
are fulfilled. S.Rep. No.1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess.
5 (1952), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952,
pp. 2394, 2399 (emphasis added); H.R.Rep.
No.1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1952) (emphasis
added).
This statement does not support the contention
that Congress intended anything under the sun to
be patentable. To the contrary, the language supports
the opposite view: a person may have
invented anything under the sun, but it is not necessarily
patentable unless the statutory requirements
for patentability have been satisfied. Thus,
the legislative history oft-cited to support business
method patents undercuts, rather than supports, the
notion that Congress intended to extend the scope
of section 101 to encompass such methods.
Moreover, the cited legislative history is not
discussing process claims at all. The quoted language
is discussing machines and
manufactures; it is therefore surprising that it has
been thought a fit basis for allowing patents on
business processes.
III.
The Constitution does not grant Congress unfettered
authority to issue patents. See U.S. Const.
FN3
art. I,  8.Instead, the *1001 patent power is a
qualified authority ... [which] is limited to the promotion
of advances in the useful arts.  Graham,
383 U.S. at 5, 86 S.Ct. 684; see also KSR Int'l Co.
v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727,
1746, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007) (reaffirming that patents
are designed to promote the progress of useful
arts). What the framers described as useful arts,
we in modern times call technology. Paulik v.
Rizkalla, 760 F.2d 1270, 1276 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en
banc). Therefore, by mandating that patents advance
the useful arts, [t]he Constitution explicitly
limited patentability to ... the process today called
technological innovation.  Comiskey, 499 F.3d at
1375 (quoting Paulik, 760 F.2d at 1276); see also
In re Foster, 58 C.C.P.A. 1001, 438 F.2d 1011
(1971) (All that is necessary ... to make a sequence
of operational steps a statutory process' within 35

arts.); Karl B. Lutz, Patents and Science: A Clarification

ideas about the best way to run a business.We
had *1002 thus rejected as unpatentable a method
for coordinating firefighting efforts, Patton, 127
F.2d at 326-27, a method for deciding how salesmen
should best handle customers, In re Maucorps,
609 F.2d 481 (CCPA 1979), and a computerized
method for aiding a neurologist in diagnosing patients,
In re Meyer, 688 F.2d 789 (CCPA 1982).

We stated that patentable processes must be
in the technological arts so as to be in consonance
with the Constitutional purpose to promote the progress
of useful arts.  In re Musgrave, 57

FN4. [D]espite the assertions in State
Street and Schrader, very few in the patent
community believe that business methods
have always been patentable. To the contrary,
the dominant view is that the law has
changed, and that the definition of patentable
subject matter is now wider than it
once was. R. Carl Moy, Subjecting Rembrandt
to the Rule of Law: Rule-Based
Solutions for Determining the Patentability
of Business Methods, 28 Wm. Mitchell
L.Rev. 1047, 1060 (2002) (footnotes omitted);
see also Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss,
Are Business Method Patents Bad for Business?,
16 Santa Clara Computer & High
Tech. L.J. 263, 265-66 (2000) (State Street
gave judicial recognition to business
method patents.). Over the course of two
centuries, a few patents issued on what
could arguably be deemed methods of doing
business, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
5,664,115 (Interactive Computer System
to Match Buyers and Sellers of Real Estate,
Businesses and Other Property Using
the Internet), but these patents were aberrations
and the general rule, prior to State
Street, was that methods of engaging in
business were ineligible for patent protection.
See Comiskey, 499 F.3d at 1374
(noting that [a]t one time, [t]hough seemingly
within the category of process or
method, a method of doing business [was]
rejected as not being within the statutory
classes.  (quoting State Street, 149 F.3d
at 1377)). One commentator has noted that
although the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) in an attempt
to deflect criticism [has] issued an
apologia ... asserting that business method
patents are as old as the United States patent
system, this document is fundamentally
flawed. See Pollack, supra at 73-75.
She explains:
The USPTO wants us to believe that it
found no records of patents whose points
of invention were business methods, because
no one had time to invent any new
business methods until the human race
had run its mechanical ingenuity to the
peak of computer software; seemingly
we were all too busy inventing the computer
to think about anything else-
especially new ways of doing business. I
thought that we granted patents because,
otherwise, people would be too busy
making money by running businesses to
take time out to invent anything except
business methods. The USPTO
[document], furthermore, is eliding the
printed matter exception to patentable
subject matter with the business method
exception.

ted to a business method, while the claims
in Maucorps and Meyer were rejected as
attempts to patent mathematical algorithms.
Subsequently, however, this
court stated that the claimed processes in
Maucorps and Meyer were directed toward
business systems and should therefore not
be considered patent eligible. In re Alappat,
33 F.3d 1526, 1541 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en
banc). We noted that  Maucorps dealt
with a business methodology for deciding
how salesmen should best handle respective
customers and Meyer involved a
system for aiding a neurologist in diagnosing
patients. Clearly, neither of the alleged
inventions' in those cases falls within
any  101 category. Id.
Business method patents do not promote the
useful arts because they are not directed to any
technological or scientific innovation. Although
business method applications may use technology-
such as computers-to accomplish desired results,
the innovative aspect of the claimed method is an
entrepreneurial rather than a technological one.
Thus, although Bilski's claimed hedging method
could theoretically be implemented on a computer,
that alone does not render it patentable. See Diehr,
450 U.S. at 192 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (Patentability
cannot be established by the token use of technology.);
Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 64-66,
93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972) (finding unpatentable
a method of programming a general purpose
digital computer to convert signals from binary-
coded decimal to pure binary form). Where a
claimed business method simply uses a known machine
to do what it was designed to do, such as using
a computer to gather data or perform calculations,
use of that machine will not bring otherwise
unpatentable subject matter within the ambit of section
101. See Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253
(finding a process unpatentable where [t]he mathematical
procedures [could] be carried out in existing
computers long in use, no new machinery being
necessary).
Although the Supreme Court has not directly
addressed the patentability of business methods,
several of its decisions implicitly tether patentability
to technological innovation. See Pfaff v. Wells
Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 63, 119 S.Ct. 304, 142
L.Ed.2d 261 (1998) ([T]he patent system represents
a carefully crafted bargain that encourages
both the creation and the public disclosure of new
and useful advances in technology, in return for an
exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time.

Court has repeatedly emphasized that what renders
subject matter patentable is the application of the
law of nature to a new and useful end. Funk Bros.

and consistent body of Supreme Court case law establishes
that the term invention encompasses
anything made by man that utilizes or harnesses
one or more laws of nature for human benefit.).
As the Supreme Court has made clear, the act of
invention ... consists neither in finding out the laws
of nature, nor in fruitful research as to the operation
of natural laws, but in discovering how those laws
may be utilized or applied for some beneficial purpose,
by a process, a device or a machine. United

FN6. Laws of nature are those laws pertaining
to the natural sciences, such as
biology, chemistry, or physics. See, e.g.,
Webster's New International Dictionary
1507 (3d ed. 2002) (Natural sciences are
the branches of science ( [such] as physics,
chemistry, [or] biology) that deal with
matter, energy, and their interrelations and
transformations or with objectively measured

from other types of law, such as
laws of economics or statutory enactments.

Court and [the Federal Circuit prior

FN7. One commentator notes that both Japan
and the Republic of Korea explicitly
define an invention as the application of
a law of nature, and argues that the United
States should follow a similar approach to
patentability. See Andrew A. Schwartz,
The Patent Office Meets the Poison Pill:
Why Legal Methods Cannot be Patented,
20 Harv. J. Law & Tech. 333, 357 (2007).
Methods of doing business do not apply the
law of nature to a new and useful end. Because the
innovative aspect of such methods is an entrepreneurial
rather than a technological one, they should
be deemed ineligible for patent protection. See, e.g.,
John R. Thomas, The Patenting of the Liberal Professions,
40 B.C. L.Rev. 1139 (1999) (arguing that
affording patentability to business methods opens
the door to obtaining patent protection for all aspects
of human thought and behavior, and that patents
should remain grounded in science and technology)
(hereinafter Thomas (1999)). [T]he
primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation
of private fortunes for the owners of patents
but is to promote the progress of science and useful
arts.  *1004Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal
Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 511, 37 S.Ct.

patents may do much to enrich their owners,
they do little to promote scientific research and
technological innovation.

patents on methods of doing business. It
passed the American Inventors Protection
Act (commonly referred to as the First Inventor
Defense Act) which provides an affirmative
defense against a business method
patent infringement action if the defendant
acting in good faith, actually reduced
the subject matter to practice at least
1 year before the effective filing date of
such patent, and commercially used the
subject matter before the effective filing
date of such patent. See 35 U.S.C.  273.
Even where a defendant may qualify for
this defense, however, he still must engage
in expensive litigation where [he]
bears the burden of affirmatively raising
and proving the defense. See Nicholas A.

Patents granted in the wake of State Street have
ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly
absurd. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,851,117

video displays); U.S. Patent No. 5,862,223

Patent No. 6,329,919 (system for toilet reservations);
U.S. Patent No. 7,255,277 (method of using
color-coded bracelets to designate dating status in
order to limit the embarrassment of rejection).
There has even been a patent issued on a method
for obtaining a patent. See U.S. Patent No.
6,049,811. Not surprisingly, State Street and its
progeny have generated a thundering chorus of criticism.

There are a host of difficulties associated with
allowing patents to issue on methods of conducting

rather than promote innovation, they are frequently
of poor quality. Most fundamentally, they raise significant

Patents should be granted to those inventions
which would not be disclosed or devised but for
the inducement of a patent. Id. at 11, 86 S.Ct. 684.
Methods of doing business have existed since the
earliest days of the Patent Act and have flourished
even in the absence of patent protection. See Brian
P. Biddinger, Limiting the Business Method Patent:
A Comparison and Proposed Alignment of
European, Japanese and United States Patent Law,
69 Fordham L.Rev. 2523, 2544-50 (2001). Commentators
have argued that the broad grant of patent
protection for methods of doing business is
something of a square peg in a sinkhole of uncertain
dimensions since [n]owhere in the substantial
literature on innovation is there a statement that
the United States economy suffers from a lack of
innovation in methods of doing business. Raskind,
supra at 92-93. Instead, the long history of U.S.
business is one of innovation, emulation, and innovation
again. It also is a history of remarkable
creativity and success, all without business method
patents until the past few years. Smith, supra at
178; see also Sfekas, supra at 213 (While innovation
in business methods is a good thing, it is likely
that there would be the same level of innovation
even without patents on [such methods].).
Business innovations, by their very nature,
provide a competitive advantage and thus generate
their own incentives. See Xiang, supra at 813 (A
business entity improves the way it does business in
order to be more effective and efficient, to stay
ahead of [the] competition, and to make more
profit.). The rapid growth of fast food restaurants,
self-service gasoline stations, quick oil change facilities
... automatic teller devices ... and alternat
ives for long-distance telephone services casts real
doubt about the need for the additional incentive of
patent protection in the commercial realm. Raskind,
supra at 93.
Although patents are not a prerequisite to business
innovation, they are of undeniable importance
in promoting technological advances. For example,
the pharmaceutical*1006 industry relies on patent
protection in order to recoup the large sums it invests
to develop life-saving and life-enhancing
drugs:
[T]he fully loaded cost of developing a single
new pharmaceutical molecule, taking it though
laboratory and clinical trials, and securing FDA
approval for its marketing is today about $800
million (including the cost of project failures).
Furthermore, fewer than one in five drug candidates
that make it out of the laboratory survive this
tortuous process and reach the marketplace in the
form of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.... Only
patent protection can make the innovator's substantial
investment in development and clinical
testing economically rational.
Jay Dratler, Jr., Alice in Wonderland Meets the
U.S. Patent System, 38 Akron L.Rev. 299, 313-14
(2005) (footnotes omitted).
Business method patents, unlike those granted
for pharmaceuticals and other products, offer rewards
that are grossly disproportionate to the costs
of innovation. In contrast to technological endeavors,
business innovations frequently involve
little or no investment in research and development.
Bilski, for example, likely spent only nominal sums
to develop his hedging method. The reward he
could reap if his application were allowed-exclusive
rights over methods of managing risks in a wide
array of commodity transactions-vastly exceeds any
costs he might have incurred in devising his
invention.

from dismissal of writ of certiorari)
(emphasis in original). This is particularly true in
the context of patents on methods of conducting
business. Instead of providing incentives to competitors
to develop improved business techniques,
business method patents remove building blocks of
commercial innovation from the public domain.
Dreyfuss, supra at 275-77. Because they restrict
competitors from using and improving upon patented
business methods, such patents stifle innovation.
When we grant rights to exclude unnecessarily,
we ... limit competition with no quid pro quo.
Retarding competition retards further development.
Pollack, supra at 76. Think how the airline
industry might now be structured if the first company
to offer frequent flyer miles had enjoyed the
sole right to award them or how differently mergers
and acquisitions would be financed ... if the use of
junk bonds had been protected by a patent. Dreyfuss,
supra at 264. By affording patent protection to
business practices, the government distorts the operation
of the free market system and reduces the
gains from the operation of the market. Sfekas,
supra at 214.
It is often consumers who suffer when business
methods are patented. See Raskind, supra at 82.
Patented products are more expensive because licensing
fees are often passed on to consumers. See
Lois Matelan, The Continuing Controversy Over
Business Method Patents, 18 Fordham Intell. Prop.
Med. & Ent. L.J. 189, 201 (2007). Further, as a
general matter, quantity and quality [of patented
products] are less than they would be in a competitive
market. Dreyfuss, supra at 275.
*1007 Patenting business methods makes
American companies less competitive in the global
marketplace. American companies can now obtain
exclusionary rights on methods of conducting business,
but their counterparts in Europe and Japan
generally cannot. See Biddinger, supra at 2546-47.
Producing products in the United States becomes
more expensive because American companies, unlike
their overseas counterparts, must incur licensing
fees in order to use patented business methods:
[O]nce a United States patent application for a
new method of doing business becomes publicly
available, companies in Europe and Japan may
begin using the method outside the United States,
while American companies in competition with
the patentee would be unable to use the method
in the United States without incurring licensing
fees. The result is that companies outside of the
United States receive the benefit of the novel
method without incurring either the research and
development costs of the inventor, or the licensing
fees of the patentee's American competitors.
Id. at 2545-46.
C.
Another significant problem that plagues business
method patents is that they tend to be of poor
overall quality. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange,
L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 397, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164
L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) (Kennedy, J., joined by
Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., concurring)
(noting the potential vagueness and suspect validity
of some of the burgeoning number of patents
over business methods). Commentators have
lamented the frequency with which the Patent Office
issues patents on shockingly mundane business
inventions. Dreyfuss, supra at 268; see also Pollack,
supra at 106 ([M]any of the recently-issued
business method patents are facially (even farcically)
obvious to persons outside the USPTO.). One
reason for the poor quality of business method patents
is the lack of readily accessible prior art references.
Because business methods were not patentable
prior to State Street, there is very little patent-
related prior art readily at hand to the examiner
corps. Dreyfuss, supra at 269.

Furthermore, information about methods of
conducting business, unlike information about technological
endeavors, is often not documented or
published in scholarly journals. See Russell A.
Korn, Is Legislation the Answer? An Analysis of the
Proposed Legislation for Business Method Patents,
29 Fla. St. U.L.Rev. 1367, 1372-73 (2002). The fact
that examiners lack the resources to weed out undeserving
applications has led to the improper approval
of a large number of patents, leaving private
parties to clean up the mess through litigation.
Krause, supra at 97.
Allowing patents to issue on business methods
shifts critical resources away from promoting and
protecting truly useful technological advances. As
discussed previously, the patent office has been deluged
with business method applications in recent
years. Time spent on such applications is time not
spent on applications which claim true innovations.
When already overburdened examiners are forced
to devote significant time to reviewing large numbers
of business method applications, the public's
access to new and beneficial technologies is unjustifiably
delayed.
D.
Patenting business methods allows private
parties to claim exclusive ownership of ideas and
practices which rightfully belong in the public domain.
It is a matter of public interest that
[economic] decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent
and well *1008 informed. To this end, the free
flow of commercial information is indispensable.
Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 765, 96
S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976). Thus, the
stringent requirements for patent protection seek to
assure that ideas in the public domain remain there
for the free use of the public. Aronson v. Quick
Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262, 99 S.Ct. 1096,
59 L.Ed.2d 296 (1979).
Bilski's claimed method consists essentially of
two conversations. The first conversation is
between a commodity provider and a commodity
consumer, while the second conversation is
between the provider and market participants
who have a counter-risk position to ... consumers.
His claims provide almost no details as to the contents
of these conversations.
Like many business method applications, Bilski's
application is very broadly drafted. It covers a
wide range of means for hedging in commodity
transactions. If his application were allowed, anyone
who discussed ways to balance market risks in
any sort of commodity could face potential infringement
liability. By adopting overly expansive
standards for patentability, the government enables
private parties to impose broad and unwarranted
burdens on speech and the free flow of ideas. See
Thomas F. Cotter, A Burkean Perspective on Patent
Eligibility, 22 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 855, 880-82
(2007) (arguing that overly expansive patent eligibility
standards can result in the granting of patents
that threaten free speech, privacy and other constitutionally-
protected rights); John R. Thomas, The
Future of Patent Law: Liberty and Property in the
Patent Law, 39 Hous. L.Rev. 569, 589 (2002)
(arguing that the patent law allows private actors
to impose more significant restraints on speech than
has ever been possible through copyright); see
also Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv.

S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980) (The First
Amendment mandates that restrictions on free
speech in commercial transactions be no more extensive
than necessary.).
To the extent that business methods are deemed
patentable, individuals can face unexpected potential
infringement liability for everyday conversations
and commercial interactions. [I]mplicit in the
Patent Clause itself [is the understanding] that free
exploitation of ideas will be the rule, to which the
protection of a federal patent is the exception.

V.
The majority's proposed
machine-or-transformation test for patentability
will do little to stem the growth of patents on non-
technological methods and ideas. Quite simply, in
the context of business method patent applications,
the majority's proposed standard can be too easily
circumvented. See Cotter, supra at 875 (noting that
the physical transformation test for patentability
can be problematic because [i]n a material universe,
every process will cause some sort of physical
transformation, if only at the microscopic level
or within the human body, including the brain).
Through clever draftsmanship, nearly every process
claim can be rewritten to include a physical transformation.
Bilski, for example, could simply add a
requirement that a commodity consumer install a
meter to record commodity consumption. He could
then argue that installation*1009 of this meter was
a physical transformation, sufficient to satisfy the
majority's proposed patentability test.
Even as written, Bilski's claim arguably involves
a physical transformation. Prior to utilizing
Bilski's method, commodity providers and commodity
consumers are not involved in transactions
to buy and sell a commodity at a fixed rate. By using
Bilski's claimed method, however, providers
and consumers enter into a series of transactions allowing
them to buy and sell a particular commodity
at a particular price. Entering into a transaction is a
physical process: telephone calls are made, meetings
are held, and market participants must physically
execute contracts. Market participants go from
a state of not being in a commodity transaction to a
state of being in such a transaction. The majority,
however, fails to explain how this sort of physical
transformation is insufficient to satisfy its proposed
patent eligibility standard.
The majority suggests that a technological arts
test is nothing more that a shortcut for its machine-
or-transformation test. Ante at 964. To the
contrary, however, the two tests are fundamentally
different. Consider U.S. Patent No. 7,261,652,
which is directed to a method of putting a golf ball,
U.S. Patent No. 6,368,227, which is directed to a
method of swinging on a swing suspended on a tree
branch, and U.S. Patent No. 5,443,036, which is
directed to a method of inducing cats to exercise.
Each of these inventions involves a physical
transformation that is central to the claimed method:
the golfer's stroke is changed, a person on a
swing starts swinging, and the sedentary cat becomes
a fit feline. Thus, under the majority's approach,
each of these inventions is patent eligible.
Under a technological arts test, however, none of
these inventions is eligible for patent protection because
none involves any advance in science or techFN9
nology.
FN9. The majority's approach will encourage
rent-seeking on a broad range of human
thought and behavior. For example,
because organizing a country into a democratic
or socialist regime clearly involves a
physical transformation, what is to prevent
patents from issuing on forms of government?
Regardless of whether a claimed process involves
a physical transformation, it should not be
patent eligible unless it is directed to an advance in
science or technology. See Benson, 409 U.S. at
64-71, 93 S.Ct. 253 (finding a process unpatentable
even though it transformed binary-coded decimals
into pure binary numbers using a general purpose
computer). Although the Supreme Court has
stated that a patentable process will usually involve
a transformation of physical matter, see id. at 70, 93
S.Ct. 253, it has never found a process patent eligible
which did not involve a scientific or technological
innovation. See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 192-93,
101 S.Ct. 1048 (finding a process patentable where
it involved new technology for curing rubber).
The majority refuses to inject a technology requirement
into the section 101 analysis because it
believes that the terms technological arts and

technology are ambiguous. See ante at 960. To
the contrary, however, the meaning of these terms
is not particularly difficult to grasp. The need to
apply some sort of technological arts' criterion has
hardly led other countries' and regions' patent systems
to grind to a halt; it is hard to see why it
should be an insurmountable obstacle for ours.
Cotter, supra at 885. As discussed more fully in
section III, a claimed process is technological to the
extent it applies laws of nature to new ends. See
Benson, 409 U.S. at 67, 93 S.Ct. 253 ( If there is
to be invention from ... a discovery, it *1010 must
come from the application of the law of nature to a
new and useful end.  (quoting Funk Bros., 333
U.S. at 130, 68 S.Ct. 440)). By contrast, a process
is non-technological where its inventive concept is
the application of principles drawn not from the
natural sciences but from disciplines such as business,
law, sociology, or psychology. See Thomas
(1999), supra at 1168 ([F]ew of us would suppose
that inventions within the domain of business, law
or fine arts constitute technology, much less patentable
technology.). The inventive aspect of Bilski's
claimed process is the application of business
principles, not laws of nature; it is therefore non-
technological and ineligible for patent protection.
Unlike a technological standard for patentability,
the majority's proposed test will be exceedingly
difficult to apply. The standard that the majority
proposes for inclusion in the patentability lexicon
transformation of any physical object or substance,
or an electronic signal representative of any physical
object or substance, ante at 964-is unnecessarily
complex and will only lead to further uncertainty
regarding the scope of patentable subject matter. As
noted in In re Nuijten, 500 F.3d 1346, 1353
(Fed.Cir.2007), defining the term physical can be
an esoteric and metaphysical inquiry. Indeed, although
this court has struggled for years to set out
what constitutes sufficient physical transformation
to render a process patentable, we have yet to
provide a consistent or satisfactory resolution of
this issue.
We took this case en banc in a long-overdue effort
to resolve primal questions on the metes and
bounds of statutory subject matter. The patent system
has run amok, and the USPTO, as well as the
larger patent community, has actively sought guidance
from this court in making sense of our section
101 jurisprudence. See Supplemental Br. of Appellee
at 3 ([The Federal Circuit] should clarify
the meaning of State Street and AT & T, as they
have been too often misunderstood.); Br. of Fin.
Serv. Indus. at 1 (The rise of [business method
patents] in recent years has ... led to uncertainty
over the scope of the patents granted and, more fundamentally,
the definition of patentable subject
matter itself. [We] seek a workable standard defining
the scope of patentable subject matter, one that
... provides clear guidance to the Patent and Trademark
Office ... and the public.); Br. of Samuelson
Law, Tech. and Public Policy Clinic at 1 (Ever
since State Street, the [USPTO] has been flooded
with applications for a wide variety of non-
technological inventions' such as arbitration methods,
dating methods, tax-planning methods, legal
methods, and novel-writing methods. These applications
have eroded public confidence in the patent
system and driven up the cost and decreased the return
for applicants seeking legitimate technological
patents. (footnote omitted)); Br. of Assoc. of Am.
Medical Colleges at 29 (arguing that broad swaths
of the public and certain industry sectors have lost
respect for the patent system and that [the Federal
Circuit] should act, even if its actions mean unsettling
the settled expectations of some). The majority,
however, fails to enlighten three of the thorniest
issues in the patentability thicket: (1) the continued
viability of business method patents, (2) what constitutes
sufficient physical transformation or machine-
implementation to render a process patentable,
and (3) the extent to which computer software
and computer-implemented processes constitute
statutory subject matter. The majority's
measured approach to the section 101 analysis,
see ante at 962, will do little to restore public confidence
in the patent system or stem the growth of
patents on *1011 business methods and other non

technological ideas.
VI.
Where the advance over the prior art on which
the applicant relies to make his invention patentable
is an advance in a field of endeavor such as law
(like the arbitration method in Comiskey ), business
(like the method claimed by Bilski) or other liberal-
as opposed to technological-arts, the application
falls outside the ambit of patentable subject matter.
The time is ripe to repudiate State Street and to recalibrate
the standards for patent eligibility, thereby
ensuring that the patent system can fulfill its constitutional
mandate to protect and promote truly useful
innovations in science and technology. I dissent
from the majority's failure to do so.
RADER, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
This court labors for page after page, paragraph
after paragraph, explanation after explanation to
say what could have been said in a single sentence:
Because Bilski claims merely an abstract idea, this
court affirms the Board's rejection. If the only
problem of this vast judicial tome were its circuitous
path, I would not dissent, but this venture also
disrupts settled and wise principles of law.
Much of the court's difficulty lies in its reliance
on dicta taken out of context from numerous Supreme
Court opinions dealing with the technology
of the past. In other words, as innovators seek the
path to the next tech no-revolution, this court ties
our patent system to dicta from an industrial age
decades removed from the bleeding edge. A direct
reading of the Supreme Court's principles and cases
on patent eligibility would yield the one-sentence
resolution suggested above. Because this court,
however, links patent eligibility to the age of iron
and steel at a time of subatomic particles and terabytes,
I must respectfully dissent.
I
The Patent Law of the United States has always
embodied the philosophy that ingenuity should receive
a liberal encouragement. Writings of
Thomas Jefferson 75-76 (Washington ed. 1871);
see also Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303,
308-09, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980).
True to this principle, the original Act made  any
new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition
of matter patent eligible. Act of Feb. 21,
1793, ch. 11,  1, 1 Stat. 318 (emphasis supplied).
Even as the laws have evolved, that bedrock principle
remains at their foundation. Thus, the Patent
Act from its inception focused patentability on the
specific characteristics of the claimed invention-its
novelty and utility-not on its particular subject matter
category.
The modern incarnation of section 101 holds
fast to that principle, setting forth the broad categories
of patent eligible subject matter, and conditioning
patentability on the characteristics, not the
category, of the claimed invention:
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to
the conditions and requirements of this title.
35 U.S.C.  101 (2006) (emphases supplied).
As I have suggested, the Supreme Court requires
this court to rely on the ordinary, contemporary,
common meaning of these words. Diamond v.
Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67
L.Ed.2d 155 (1981). If this court would follow that
Supreme Court rule, it would afford broad patent
protection to new and *1012 useful inventions that
fall within the enumerated categories and satisfy
the other conditions of patentability. That is, after
all, precisely what the statute says.
In Diehr, the Supreme Court adopted a very
useful algorithm for determining patentable subject
matter, namely, follow the Patent Act itself. After
setting forth the procedural history of that case, the
Supreme Court stated: In cases of statutory construction,
we begin with the language of the statute.
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048. With
an eye to the Benson language (so central to this
court's reasoning) that [t]ransformation and reduc

tion of an article to a different state or thing is the
clue to the patentability of a process claim that does
not include particular machines, Gottschalk v.
Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 72, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d
273 (1972), the Court then noted:
[I]n dealing with the patent laws, we have more
than once cautioned that courts should not read
into the patent laws limitations and conditions
which the legislature has not expressed.
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 182, 101 S.Ct. 1048
(citations omitted). Indeed section 101's term
process contains no hint of an exclusion for certain
types of methods. This court today nonetheless
holds that a process is eligible only if it falls within
certain subsets of process. Ironically the Patent
Act itself specifically defines process without any
of these judicial innovations. 35 U.S.C.  100(b).
Therefore, as Diehr commands, this court should
refrain from creating new circuitous judge-made
tests.
Read in context, section 101 gives further reasons
for interpretation without innovation. Specifically,
section 101 itself distinguishes patent eligibility
from the conditions of patentability-providing
generously for patent eligibility, but noting that patentability
requires substantially more. The language
sweeps in any new and useful process ... [and] any
improvement. 35 U.S.C.  101 (emphasis supplied).
As an expansive modifier, any embraces
the broad and ordinary meanings of the term
process, for instance. The language of section
101 conveys no implication that the Act extends
patent protection to some subcategories of processes
but not others. It does not mean some or
even most, but all.
Unlike the laws of other nations that include
broad exclusions to eligible subject matter, such as
European restrictions on software and other method
patents, see European Patent Convention of 1973,
Art. 52(2)(c) and (3), and prohibitions against patents
deemed contrary to the public morality, see id.
at Art. 53(a), U.S. law and policy have embraced
advances without regard to their subject matter.
That promise of protection, in turn, fuels the research
that, at least for now, makes this nation the
world's innovation leader.
II
With all of its legal sophistry, the court's new
test for eligibility today does not answer the most
fundamental question of all: why would the expansive
language of section 101 preclude protection of
innovation simply because it is not transformational
or properly linked to a machine (whatever that
means)? Stated even more simply, why should
some categories of invention deserve no protection?
This court, which reads the fine print of Supreme
Court decisions from the Industrial Age with
admirable precision, misses the real import of those
decisions. The Supreme Court has answered the
fundamental question above many times. The Supreme
Court has counseled that the only limits on
eligibility are inventions that embrace natural laws,
natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. See, e.g.,
Diehr, 450 U.S. at 185, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (This
Court *1013 has undoubtedly recognized limits to
101 and every discovery is not embraced within the
statutory terms. Excluded from such patent protection
are laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract
ideas.). In Diehr, the Supreme Court's last
pronouncement on eligibility for processes, the
Court said directly that its only exclusions from the
statutory language are these three common law exclusions:
Our recent holdings ... stand for no more
than these long-established principles. Id. at 185,
101 S.Ct. 1048.
This point deserves repetition. The Supreme
Court stated that all of the transformation and machine
linkage explanations simply restated the abstractness
rule. In reading Diehr to suggest a non-
statutory transformation or preemption test, this
court ignores the Court's admonition that all of its
recent holdings do no more than restate the natural
laws and abstractness exclusions. Id.; see also
Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 310, 100 S.Ct. 2204

new bacterium with markedly different characteristics
from any found in nature and one having the potential
for significant utility. His discovery is not
nature's handiwork, but his own; accordingly it is
patentable subject matter under  101.); Parker v.
Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 591-594, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57
L.Ed.2d 451 (1978) (Even though a phenomenon
of nature or mathematical formula may be well
known, an inventive application of the principle
may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such
a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there
is some other inventive concept in its application.);
In re Taner, 681 F.2d 787, 791 (C.C.P.A
1982) (In Diehr, the Supreme Court made clear
that Benson stands for no more than the long-
established principle that laws of nature, natural
phenomena, and abstract ideas are excluded from
patent protection.).
The abstractness and natural law preclusions
not only make sense, they explain the purpose of
the expansive language of section 101. Natural laws
and phenomena can never qualify for patent protection
because they cannot be invented at all. After
all, God or Allah or Jahveh or Vishnu or the Great
Spirit provided these laws and phenomena as humanity's
common heritage. Furthermore, abstract
ideas can never qualify for patent protection because
the Act intends, as section 101 explains, to
provide useful technology. An abstract idea must
be applied to (transformed into) a practical use before
it qualifies for protection. The fine print of Supreme
Court opinions conveys nothing more than
these basic principles. Yet this court expands
(transforms?) some Supreme Court language into
rules that defy the Supreme Court's own rule.
When considering the eligibility of
processes, this court should focus on the potential
for an abstract claim. Such an abstract claim would
appear in a form that is not even susceptible to examination
against prior art under the traditional
tests for patentability. Thus this court would wish
to ensure that the claim supplied some concrete,
tangible technology for examination. Indeed the
hedging claim at stake in this appeal is a classic example
of abstractness. Bilski's method for hedging
risk in commodities trading is either a vague economic
concept or obvious on its face. Hedging is a
fundamental economic practice long prevalent in
our system of commerce and taught in any introductory
finance class. In any event, this facially abstract
claim does not warrant the creation of new
eligibility exclusions.
III
This court's willingness to venture away from
the statute follows on the heels of an *1014 oft-
discussed dissent from the Supreme Court's dismissal
of its grant of certiorari in Lab. Corp. of Am.
Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., 548 U.S. 124,
126 S.Ct. 2921, 165 L.Ed.2d 399 (2006). That dissent
is premised on a fundamental misapprehension
of the distinction between a natural phenomenon
and a patentable process.
The distinction between phenomena of
nature, mental processes, and abstract intellectual
concepts is not difficult to draw. The fundamental
error in that Lab. Corp. dissent is its failure
to recognize the difference between a patent ineligible
relationship-i.e., that between high homocysteine
levels and folate and cobalamin deficiencies-
and a patent eligible process for applying that
relationship to achieve a useful, tangible, and concrete
result-i.e., diagnosis of potentially fatal conditions
in patients. Nothing abstract here. Moreover,
testing blood for a dangerous condition is not a natural
phenomenon, but a human invention.
The distinction is simple but critical: A patient
may suffer from the unpatentable phenomenon of
nature, namely high homocysteine levels and low
folate. But the invention does not attempt to claim
that natural phenomenon. Instead the patent claims
a process for assaying a patient's blood and then
analyzing the results with a new process that detects
the life-threatening condition. Moreover, the
sick patient does not practice the patented invention.
Instead the patent covers a process for testing
blood that produces a useful, concrete, and tangible

result: incontrovertible diagnostic evidence to save
lives. The patent does not claim the patent ineligible
relationship between folate and homocysteine,
nor does it foreclose future inventors from
using that relationship to devise better or different
processes. Contrary to the language of the dissent,
it is the sick patient who embod[ies] only the correlation
between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency,

2921, not the claimed process.
From the standpoint of policy, the Lab. Corp.
dissent avoids the same fundamental question that
the Federal Circuit does not ask or answer today: Is
this entire field of subject matter undeserving of incentives
for invention? If so, why? In the context of
Lab. Corp. that question is very telling: the natural
condition diagnosed by the invention is debilitating
and even deadly. See U.S. Patent No. 4,940,658,
col. 1, ll. 32-40 (Accurate and early diagnosis of
cobalamin and folate deficiencies ... is important
because these deficiencies can lead to life-
threatening hematologic abnormalities.... Accurate
and early diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency is especially
important because it can also lead to incapacitating
and life-threatening neuropsychiatric abnormalities.).
Before the invention featured in
Lab. Corp., medical science lacked an affordable,
reliable, and fast means to detect this debilitating
condition. Denial of patent protection for this innovation-
precisely because of its elegance and simplicity
(the chief aims of all good science)-would
undermine and discourage future research for diagnostic
tools. Put another way, does not Patent Law
wish to encourage researchers to find simple blood
tests or urine tests that predict and diagnose breast
cancers or immunodeficiency diseases? In that context,
this court might profitably ask whether its decisions
incentivize research for cures and other important
technical advances. Without such attention,
this court inadvertently advises investors that they
should divert their unprotectable investments away
from discovery of scientific relationships within
the body that diagnose breast cancer or Lou
Gehrig's disease or Parkinson's or whatever.
*1015 IV
In sum, this court today invents several circuitous
and unnecessary tests. It should have merely
noted that Bilski attempts to patent an abstract idea.
Nothing more was needed. Instead this opinion
propagates unanswerable questions: What form or
amount of transformation suffices? When is a
representative of a physical object sufficiently
linked to that object to satisfy the transformation
test? (e.g., Does only vital sign data taken directly
from a patient qualify, or can population data derived
in part from statistics and extrapolation be
used?) What link to a machine is sufficient to invoke
the or machine prong? Are the specific
machines of Benson required, or can a general purpose
computer qualify? What constitutes
extra-solution activity? If a process may meet eligibility
muster as a machine, why does the Act
require a machine link for a process to show
eligibility? Does the rule against redundancy itself
suggest an inadequacy in this complex spider web
of tests supposedly required by the language of
section 101?
One final point, reading section 101 as it is
written will not permit a flurry of frivolous and useless
inventions. Even beyond the exclusion for abstractness,
the final clause of section 101-subject
to the conditions and requirements of this
title-ensures that a claimed invention must still
satisfy the conditions and requirements set forth
in the remainder title 35. Id. These statutory conditions
and requirements better serve the function of
screening out unpatentable inventions than some
vague transformation or proper machine link
test.
In simple terms, the statute does not mention
transformations or any of the other Industrial Age
descriptions of subject matter categories that this
court endows with inordinate importance today.
The Act has not empowered the courts to impose
limitations on patent eligible subject matter beyond
the broad and ordinary meaning of the terms process,
machine, manufacture, and composition of

matter. It has instead preserved the promise of patent
protection for still unknown fields of invention.
Innovation has moved beyond the brick and
mortar world. Even this court's test, with its caveats
and winding explanations seems to recognize this.
Today's software transforms our lives without physical
anchors. This court's test not only risks hobbling
these advances, but precluding patent protection
for tomorrow's technologies. We still do not
know one thousandth of one percent of what nature
has revealed to us. Attributed to Albert Einstein. If
this court has its way, the Patent Act may not incentivize,
but complicate, our search for the vast
secrets of nature. When all else fails, consult the
statute.
