ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION CONSULTANTS
CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2008-1430.
April 8, 2009.
Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied June 5,
2009.
Background: Holder of patents relating to automated
toll collection systems brought infringement
action against toll collection service provider. The
United States District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, James Edgar Kinkeade, J., 2008 WL
2152027, entered summary judgment in provider's
favor, and holder appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) doctrine of patent exhaustion barred holder's
patent infringement claims against provider;
(2) parol evidence of parties' intent not to provide
downstream rights to customers was irrelevant; and
(3) holder's rights to patent that had not yet issued,
and was thus not identified in settlement agreement,
were exhausted.
Affirmed.

Judges.

TransCore, LP and TC License, Ltd.
(collectively TransCore) appeal from a final
judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Texas that was entered upon the district
court's grant *1273 of summary judgment. See
Transcore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants
Corp., No. 3:05-CV-2316-K, 2008 WL
2152027 (N.D.Tex. May 22, 2008). Specifically,
the District Court found that TransCore's patent infringement
claims against Electronic Transaction
Consultants Corp. (ETC) were barred by patent
exhaustion, implied license and legal estoppel, in
view of a settlement agreement between TransCore
and the supplier of the products ETC installed,
Mark IV. Because we agree with the district court
and find that Mark IV's sales were authorized and
exhausted TransCore's patent rights, thus barring
TransCore's claims against ETC, we affirm.
BACKGROUND
TransCore is engaged in the manufacture, sale
and installation of automated toll collection systems-
the tags and readers that communicate as a
vehicle passes through an automated toll plaza
(e.g., E-ZPass). TransCore is the assignee of several
patents to related technologies.
In 2000, TransCore sued a competitor, Mark IV
Industries, for infringement of several TransCore
patents. That action was resolved by a settlement
agreement, in which Mark IV agreed to pay $4.5M
in exchange for an unconditional covenant not to
sue and a release of all existing claims. The covenant
and release, which are central to the dispute
here, read:
3. In exchange for the payment set forth in paragraph
1, TCI hereby agrees and covenants not to
bring any demand, claim, lawsuit, or action
against Mark IV for future infringement of any of
United States Patent Nos. 5,805,082; 5,289,183;
5,406,275; 5,144,553; 5,086,389; 5,751,973;
5,347,274; 5,351,187; 5,253,162; and 4,303,904,
or any foreign counterparts of the aforesaid
United States Patents, for the entire remainder of
the terms of the respective United States Patents
and their foreign counterparts. This Covenant Not
To Sue shall not apply to any other patents issued
as of the effective date of this Agreement or to be
issued in the future.
***
8. TCI, TII and GRAVELLE, for themselves and
their respective predecessors, successors, heirs
and assigns, fully and forever release, discharge
and dismiss all claims, demands, actions, causes
of action, liens and rights, in law or in equity
(known, unknown, contingent, accrued, inchoate
or otherwise), existing as of June 26, 2001, that
they have against MARK IV, and its officers, directors,
employees, representatives and attorneys
of MARK IV, but excluding any claims for
breach of this Agreement. No express or implied
license or future release whatsoever is granted to
MARK IV or to any third party by this Release.
Several years later, ETC, a firm engaged in
consulting and systems integration related to toll-
collection systems, won a bid with the Illinois State
Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) to install and test
a new open-road tolling system. As part of the contract,
ETC agreed to set up and test toll-collection
systems purchased by the ISTHA from Mark IV.
TransCore sued ETC for infringement of three
patents that had previously been in suit against
Mark IV (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,805,082; 5,289,183;
and 5,406,275 (the '082, '183, and '275 patents)) as
well as U.S. Patent No. 6,653,946 (the '946 patent),
a related patent that was pending *1274 before the
Patent and Trademark Office but had not yet issued
at the time of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement.
During a hearing, the district court questioned the

legal impact of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement on the TransCore-ETC lawsuit and
ordered the parties to brief the issue. ETC responded
by filing a motion for summary judgment with
the district court, asserting that its activities were
permitted by the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement under the related doctrines of patent exhaustion,
implied license and legal estoppel.
On May 22, 2008, the district court granted
ETC's motion, dismissed TransCore's claims with
prejudice and directed the entry of final judgment.
TransCore timely appealed to this court. We have
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(1).
DISCUSSION
Summary judgment is appropriate if there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the
movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see also Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106
S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We review a
district court's grant of summary judgment without
deference, reapplying the same standard as the district
court. Micro Chem., Inc. v. Lextron, Inc., 318
F.3d 1119, 1121 (Fed.Cir.2003). In deciding
whether summary judgment was appropriate, we
view the evidence in a light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion with doubts resolved in
favor of the opponent.... Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 149 F.3d 1309, 1315
(Fed.Cir.1998).
I.
[1] The district court found that Mark IV's
sales of the toll collection systems installed by ETC
were authorized by the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement, such that TransCore's patent rights
FN1
were exhausted as to those systems. We agree.
FN1. Because we agree with the district
court that TransCore's claims are barred by
the doctrine of patent exhaustion, we need
not address the district court's decision on
the related doctrine of implied license by
no non-infringing use.
A.
[2] Recently, in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG
Electronics, Inc., ---U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 2109, 170
L.Ed.2d 996 (2008), the Supreme Court reiterated
unequivocally that [t]he longstanding doctrine of
patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized
sale of a patented item terminates all patent
rights to that item, id. at 2115, and that
[e]xhaustion is triggered only by a sale authorized
by the patent holder, id. at 2121. The question for
this court is whether an unconditional covenant not
to sue authorizes sales by the covenantee for purposes
of patent exhaustion. We hold that it does.
TransCore asserts that sales under a covenant
not to sue are not authorized, relying heavily on
Jacobs v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 370 F.3d 1097
(Fed.Cir.2004). In Jacobs, a panel of this court addressed
the respective roles of a license term and a
covenant not to sue in a settlement agreement. Explicitly
considering downstream customer liability,
the panel explained:
If all that [the patent holder] intended to do
through the settlement agreement *1275 was to
free [the infringing manufacturer] of its liability
for infringement, paragraph 5 of the agreement
(the covenant not to sue) would have been fully
sufficient to serve that purpose. Paragraph 3 [the
license provision], however, goes much further
by granting [the infringing manufacturer] an affirmative
right to engage in the manufacture and
sale of accelerometers to be used in tilt-sensitive
control boxes. That grant comes without restriction
of any kind.
Id. at 1101. The court in Jacobs was differentiating
between settlement terms for the express purpose
of determining the contracting parties' intent
in the context of an implied license analysis. As the
Supreme Court explained in Quanta, however, the
parties' intent with respect to downstream customers
is of no moment in a patent exhaustion analysis.
See Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at 2122 (But the question
whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant
because [the downstream customer] asserts
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

563 F.3d 1271, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1372
(Cite as: 563 F.3d 1271)
its right to practice the patents based not on implied
license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns
only on [licensee's] own license to sell products
practicing the [licensor's] Patents.). The analysis
in Jacobs, therefore, does not apply here.
[3] Rather, our analysis begins with the
premise that one cannot convey what one does not
own. This principle is particularly important in patent
licensing, as the grant of a patent does not
provide the patentee with an affirmative right to
practice the patent but merely the right to exclude.
See 35 U.S.C.  154(a)(1) (Every patent shall contain
... a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns,
of the right to exclude others from making, using,
offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout
the United States or importing the invention into
the United States ....); see also Leatherman Tool
Group Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 131 F.3d 1011,
1015 (Fed.Cir.1997) (In fact, the federal patent
laws do not create any affirmative right to make,
use, or sell anything.... [T]he Supreme Court made
clear that the patent laws provide a limited right to
exclude others from making, using, or selling a
claimed invention for a limited period of time, but
afford no affirmative right to make, use, and sell a
patented invention. (citing Bloomer v. McQuewan,
55 U.S. (14 How.) 539, 548, 14 L.Ed. 532 (1852)
(The franchise which the patent grants, consists altogether
in the right to exclude every one from
making, using, or vending the thing patented,
without the permission of the patentee. This is all
that he obtains by the patent.))). It follows, therefore,
that a patentee, by license or otherwise, cannot
convey an affirmative right to practice a patented
invention by way of making, using, selling, etc.; the
patentee can only convey a freedom from suit.
For this reason, the Supreme Court in De
Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United
States, reiterated: As a license passes no interest in
the monopoly, it has been described as a mere
waiver of the right to sue by the patentee. 273 U.S.
236, 242, 47 S.Ct. 366, 71 L.Ed. 625 (1927)
(treating a covenant not to enjoin infringing acts as
a license). To like effect, this court and its predecessors
have on numerous occasions explained that
a non-exclusive patent license is equivalent to a
covenant not to sue:
As a threshold matter, a patent license agreement
is in essence nothing more than a promise by the
licensor not to sue the licensee. Even if couched
in terms of [l]icensee is given the right to make,
use, or sell X, the agreement cannot *1276 convey
that absolute right because not even the patentee
of X is given that right. His right is merely
one to exclude others from making, using or
selling X. Indeed, the patentee of X and his licensee,
when making, using, or selling X, can be
subject to suit under other patents. In any event,
patent license agreements can be written to convey
different scopes of promises not to sue, e.g.,
a promise not to sue under a specific patent or,
more broadly, a promise not to sue under any patent
the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.

other entities); Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics
Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1031 (Fed.Cir.1995) (A
license may amount to no more than a covenant by
the patentee not to sue the licensee for making, using
or selling the patented invention, the patentee
reserving the right to grant others the same right.);
W. Elec. Co. v. Pacent Reproducer Corp., 42 F.2d
116, 118 (2d Cir.1930) (In its simplest form, a license
means only leave to do a thing which the licensor
would otherwise have a right to prevent.
Such a license grants to the licensee merely a privilege
that protects him from a claim of infringement
by the owner of the patent monopoly.). The real
question, then, is not whether an agreement is
framed in terms of a covenant not to sue or a
license. That difference is only one of form, not
substance-both are properly viewed as
authorizations. Rather, the pertinent question
here is not whether but what the TransCore-Mark
IV settlement agreement authorizes. More specifically,
does the TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement
authorize sales? We conclude that it does.
The language of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement is unambiguous: [TransCore]
agrees and covenants not to bring any demand,
claim, lawsuit, or action against Mark IV for future
infringement.... This term, without apparent restriction
or limitation, thus authorizes all acts that
would otherwise be infringements: making, using,
offering for sale, selling, or importing. TransCore
did not, as it could have, limit this authorization to,
for example, making or using. And indeed, at
oral argument, TransCore conceded that the
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement does not
include a restriction on sales. See Audio Recording
of Oral Arg. at 40:54-42:25, TransCore, LP v. Elec.

3; cf. *1277Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at 2121 (applying
patent exhaustion where [n]othing in the License
Agreement restricts [licensee's] right to sell its microprocessors
and chipsets to purchasers who in
tend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It
broadly permits Intel to make, use, [or] sell
products free of [licensor's] patent claims.
(internal quotation marks omitted)). As a result, the
district court correctly found that Mark IV's sales to
ISTHA were authorized and that TransCore's patent
rights are exhausted. The inclusion of the language
No express or implied license or future release
whatsoever is granted to MARK IV or to any third
party by this Release refers only to the effect of
the Release provision and thus does not require a
different result.
B.
As a subordinate issue to the proper interpretation
of the covenant not to sue, TransCore argues
that the district court abused its discretion by excluding
parol evidence of TransCore's and Mark
IV's intent at the time they entered into the settlement
agreement. We disagree.
[4][5] Evidentiary rulings, which are procedural
in nature, are reviewed by this court according to
the law of the regional circuit. See Sulzer Textil
A.G. v. Picanol N.V., 358 F.3d 1356, 1363
(Fed.Cir.2004). Applying Fifth Circuit law, unless
the trial court has abused its discretion and a substantial
right of the defendant has been affected, we
will not reverse on the basis of [an] evidentiary ruling
in question. United States v. Saldana, 427 F.3d
298, 306 (5th Cir.2005).
[6] The district court's decision to exclude
TransCore's parol evidence has not affected any
substantial right of TransCore. On this point
Quanta is clear. The only issue relevant to patent
exhaustion is whether Mark IV's sales were authorized,
not whether TransCore and Mark IV intended,
expressly or impliedly, for the covenant to extend
to Mark IV's customers. See Quanta, 128 S.Ct. at
2122. TransCore's proffered evidence of the parties'
intent not to provide downstream rights to Mark
IV's customers is, therefore, irrelevant and could
not impact the outcome reached by the district court
and affirmed here.

(Cite as: 563 F.3d 1271)
Moreover, California law, which governs the
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement, prohibits
the admission of parol evidence: (i) to insert an additional
term into a written contract, if the contract
is a complete and exclusive statement of the terms
of the agreement, Cal.Civ.Proc.Code  1856(b), (d);
and/or (ii) to influence the meaning of contract
terms where no ambiguity exists, id.  1856(g); see
also Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Dray-
age & Rigging Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561,
FN2
442 P.2d 641, 644-45 (Cal.1968). The district
court correctly concluded that the settlement agreement
is a final, complete and exclusive agreement,
and that the settlement agreement is unambiguous.
We, therefore, find no error in the district court's
decision not to admit TransCore's parol evidence.
FN2. We note that, under California law,
the district court may receive and consider
extrinsic evidence to determine whether
one or more terms of a contract is reason
ably susceptible to multiple meanings, see
Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc., 39 Cal.4th
384, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 668, 139 P.3d 56, 60
(2006), but once the district court determ
ines that no ambiguity exists, as it did here,
extrinsic evidence is properly not admitted,
see Pac. Gas, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d at
644-45.
*1278 C.
TransCore further argues that several material
facts remain in dispute: (1) which Mark IV entity
actually sold the products to ISTHA for installation
by ETC; (2) whether the sale from Mark IV to
ISTHA occurred within the United States; and (3)
assuming Mark IV U.S. (referred to by the parties,
at times, as IVHS) is found to have actually sold
the products to ISTHA, whether Mark IV U.S. was
included within the terms of the TransCore-Mark
IV settlement agreement, which extended coverage
to sister companies of Mark IV Canada. Based on
the record before the district court, as viewed in the
light most favorable to TransCore (the nonmovant),
we disagree.
Although the parties do not agree about which
Mark IV entity actually sold the toll collection
products-the irrevocable offer was made by Mark
IV US, but the purchase order was placed with (and
the order was ultimately filled by) Mark IV
Canada-there is no dispute that a Mark IV entity
was responsible for the sale.
Moreover, there is no dispute that the toll collection
products were sold and shipped to ISTHA.
Even if we accept TransCore's assertions that the
products were shipped from Canada, this does not
alter the essential fact that the transaction as a
whole ultimately occurred to the United States.
See Lightcubes, LLC v. N. Light Prods., Inc., 523
F.3d 1353, 1369-71 (Fed.Cir.2008) (finding that a
sale to the United States is sufficient to support
infringement liability).
Finally, as to the third disputed fact-whether
Mark IV U.S. is covered by the terms of the
TransCore-Mark IV settlement agreement-the
parties do not dispute that both Mark IV U.S. and
Mark IV Canada are wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Mark IV Industries. Because the term sister company
is commonly used and generally understood
to refer to a subsidiary company that shares common
ownership (i.e., a common parent) with another
subsidiary company, see generally, e.g., Poly-

Humana Inc. v. Comm'r, 881 F.2d 247 (6th

be beyond dispute that Mark IV U.S. is a sister
company of Mark IV Canada and thus has the same
express authority under the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement as any other sister company.

plied license to practice that patent by virtue of legal
estoppel. Again, we agree with the district court.
As explained by our predecessor court in AMP
Inc. v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448
(1968):
[W]hen a person sells a patent which employs an
invention which infringes a prior patent, the person
selling is estopped from bringing an action
against his grantee for that infringement, even
though the earlier patent is acquired after the sale
of the later patent. The same principle applies to
the grant of a patent right by license as well as
assignment.
*1279 Id. at 451 (citation omitted). Although
TransCore argues that this form of legal estoppel
only applies to prior or earlier patents, we see
no reason for so fine a distinction-the timing of patent
issuance is no more relevant to this inquiry than
the timing of acquisition. Indeed, the court in AMP
explained the policy rationale underlying the legal
estoppel doctrine in the following manner:
The essence of legal estoppel that can be found in
the estoppel of the implied license doctrine involves
the fact that the licensor (or assignor) has
licensed (or assigned) a definable property right
for valuable consideration, and then has attempted
to derogate or detract from that right. The
grantor is estopped from taking back in any extent
that for which he has already received consideration.
Id. at 452. The basic principle is, therefore,
quite simple: Legal estoppel refers to a narrow[ ]
category of conduct encompassing scenarios where
a patentee has licensed or assigned a right, received
consideration, and then sought to derogate from the
right granted. Wang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi
Elecs. Am., Inc., 103 F.3d 1571, 1581
(Fed.Cir.1997).
On summary judgment, ETC asserted, and
FN3
TransCore did not dispute,that TransCore's
later-issued '946 patent was broader than, and ne
cessary to practice, at least the '082 patent that was
included in the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement. Indeed, during discovery TransCore adopted
its ' 082 patent infringement contentions as
FN4
its contentions related to the ' 946 patent. Absent
argument to the contrary, the district court
properly concluded that in order for Mark IV to obtain
the benefit of its bargain with TransCore, it
must be permitted to practice the '946 patent to the
same extent it may practice the '183, '275 and '082
patents. TransCore is, therefore, legally estopped
from asserting the '946 patent against Mark IV in
derogation of the authorizations granted to Mark IV
under the '183, '275 and '082 patents. And Mark IV
is, in turn, an implied licensee of the ' 946 patent.
The language of the TransCore-Mark IV settlement
agreement, which states that [t]his Covenant Not
To Sue shall not apply to any other patents ... to be
issued in the future, is not to the contrary. This
language may protect TransCore against broad
claims that future patents generally are impliedly licensed,
but it does not permit TransCore to derogate
from the rights it has expressly granted and thus
does not preclude a finding of estoppel.
FN3. On appeal, TransCore claims that it
is possible to practice the '183, '275 and '
082 patents without infringing the '946 patent.
TransCore did not, however, raise this
argument to the district court. We, therefore,
deem it waived. See Sage Prods., Inc.
v. Devon Indus., Inc., 126 F.3d 1420, 1426
(Fed.Cir.1997) (If a litigant seeks to show
error in a trial court's overlooking an argument,
it must first present that argument to
the trial court. In short, this court does not
review that which was not presented to
the district court.).
FN4. At oral argument, TransCore argued
that a contention of infringement ... is not
enough for an implied license. Oral Arg.
at 39:31-39:35. This argument misses the
mark. TransCore's contentions did not create
the implied license; they merely serve

as evidence that TransCore sought to enforce
the '946 patent in derogation of the
rights it granted under the TransCore-Mark
IV settlement agreement. That attempted
derogation is prevented by legal estoppel,
which gives rise to the implied license.
Mark IV's rights under its implied license to
the '946 patent are necessarily coextensive with the
rights it received in *1280 the TransCore-Mark IV
license agreement. Mark IV's sales to ISTHA were
thus authorized and, accordingly, exhausted
TransCore's patent rights in the products sold.
CONCLUSION
The district court's decision, granting summary
judgment and thus dismissing TransCore's claims,
is affirmed.
