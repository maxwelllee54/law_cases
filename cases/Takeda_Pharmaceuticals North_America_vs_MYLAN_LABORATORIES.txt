Rehearing En Banc Denied Jan. 23, 2009.
Background: Patentee brought action against generic
drug companies alleging infringement of patent
directed toward chemical compound known as
pioglitazone when defendants filed abbreviated new
drug application (ANDA) to make generic form of
pioglitazone. After entering judgment in patentee's
favor, 2006 WL 618424, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, Denise
L. Cote, J., 459 F.Supp.2d 227, found case to be
exceptional and awarded attorney fees. Defendants
appealed, and appeals were consolidated.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit
Judge, held that:
(1) district court did not commit clear error in finding
that companies' filing of certifications with their
ANDAs was in bad faith;
(2) district court did not abuse its discretion in
awarding attorney fees of $16,800,000; and
(3) district court did not abuse its discretion in
awarding patentee its expert fees pursuant to its inherent
powers.
Affirmed.
Bryson, Circuit Judge, concurred in part, concurring
in result in part, and filed opinion.

Alphapharm Pty. Ltd. and Genpharm, Inc.
(collectively, Alphapharm) and Mylan Laboratories,
Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and UDL
Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) appeal
from the final judgment of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York.
On September 20, 2006, the court granted a motion
by plaintiff and patentee Takeda Chemical Industries,
Ltd. and its affiliate Takeda Pharmaceuticals
North America, Inc. (collectively, Takeda) to find
the case relating to Hatch-Waxman challenges
made by Alphapharm and Mylan in connection with
Takeda's U.S. Patent 4,687,777 (the '777 patent)
to be exceptional and to award attorney fees. Takeda
Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 459
F.Supp.2d 227 (S.D.N.Y.2006) ( September Opinion).
On March 21, 2007, the court quantified the
attorney fees, expenses, and expert fees, awarding
Takeda $11,400,000 from Mylan and *1384
$5,400,000 from Alphapharm, with interest. Takeda
Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., Nos.
03-8253, 04-1966, 2007 WL 840368 (S.D.N.Y.
Mar. 21, 2007) ( March Opinion ). Because we
conclude that the district court did not clearly err in
finding that this was an exceptional case because of
the misconduct of Mylan and Alphapharm and did
not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees,
we affirm.
BACKGROUND
The '777 patent covers the anti-diabetic drug
pioglitazone, for which Takeda has enjoyed commercial
success under the name ACTOS . Alphapharm
and Mylan are two generic drug companies
that sought approval to produce generic versions
of pioglitazone under the Hatch-Waxman Act. That
legislation provides the mechanism for a generic
drug company to file an abbreviated new drug application
(ANDA). An ANDA announces the intention
of the filer to sell a bioequivalent form of a
drug when approved by the FDA, and the filer
makes a certification regarding existing patents
covering the drug and its use. 21 U.S.C.  355(j)
(2006). Both Mylan and Alphapharm chose to make
certifications pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) (Paragraph IV), certifying
that the '777 patent was invalid for obviousness. In
response, Takeda sued Alphapharm and Mylan for
infringement.
At trial, Alphapharm and Mylan each changed
the focus of their invalidity arguments from those
in their certification letters. Alphapharm pointed to
a compound referred to as compound b, which
Takeda disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,287,200 (the
FN1
'200 patent) and in a 1982 scientific article
(Sohda II), as evidence that pioglitazone was
structurally obvious at the time the invention was
made. Mylan advanced an inequitable conduct argument
based on alleged misrepresentations by
Takeda to the Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO). On February 21, 2006, after an extensive
bench trial, the district court held the invention of
the '777 patent to be nonobvious and enforceable.

F.Supp.2d 341 (S.D.N.Y.2006). The district court

affirmed the district court in two separate appeals.

Derivatives, 30 Chem. Pharm. Bull. 3580
(1982).
Takeda then moved for an award of attorney
fees against both Mylan and Alphapharm on the
theory that this was an exceptional case. When a
patent has been infringed by the filing of an ANDA,
35 U.S.C.  271(e)(4) provides for the grant of
attorney fees under 35 U.S.C.  285, which in turn
allows the court to award reasonable attorney fees
to a prevailing party in exceptional cases. Takeda
contended that Mylan and Alphapharm each lacked
a good faith basis for their Paragraph IV letters and
engaged in misconduct throughout the litigation.
On September 20, 2006, the district court
agreed with Takeda in an opinion that discussed the
Paragraph IV letters and litigation conduct of Alphapharm
and Mylan in the same thorough manner
as the court's previous decision regarding the validity
of the '777 patent. Regarding Alphapharm, the
court held that the Paragraph IV certification letter
was so devoid *1385 of merit and so completely
fail[ed] to establish a prima facie case of invalidity
that it must be described as baseless.  September
Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 235. The court discussed
at length how Alphapharm's argument at trial focused
on compound b as the lead compound for future
research, whereas Alphapharm's certification
letter focused on two other compounds and contained
scientific errors. The court also analyzed
what it saw as Alphapharm's litigation misconduct,
which mainly consisted of a shifting theory of obviousness
that did not explain why compound b
would have been identified as the lead compound.
As a result, the court found that this was the exceptional
case where an examination of the totality
of the circumstances amply justifies, indeed compels,
the award of attorneys' fees. Id. at 245.
Similarly, the court held that Mylan's certification
letter was filed in bad faith and with no reasonable
basis to claim the '777 patent invalid. The
court discussed how Mylan argued in its Paragraph
IV letter that the invention of pioglitazone was obvious
based on Takeda's disclosure of a compound
in the ' 200 patent and Sohda II (referred to as compound
16 and compound 14, respectively) only to
abandon this theory entirely during the litigation. In
addition, the court discussed Takeda's numerous allegations
of litigation misconduct committed by
Mylan in its pursuit of an inequitable conduct
claim, which principally addressed Takeda's representations
to the PTO regarding a different compound
disclosed in the prior art, compound 3894.
The court also found that the inequitable conduct
claim was always frivolous and unsupported, as
Mylan did not present any evidence that Takeda hid
or misrepresented any information to the PTO. Id.
at 249. The court concluded that the totality of the
circumstances, including other instances of Mylan's
untimely conduct, justified the award of attorney
fees against Mylan as well.
On March 21, 2007, the district court quantified
the fees at $16,800,000, with Alphapharm to
pay $5,400,000 and Mylan, $11,400,000. In assessing
the amount of the award, the court stated that
the attorneys for Takeda did uniformly excellent
work in a complex and contentious litigation. When
allocating the attorney fees, the court accepted the
division proposed by Takeda, with Mylan responsible
for two-thirds of the total amount. The court
also awarded Takeda its expert fees under its inherent
power to impose sanctions, along with expenses
and interest beginning on the date of the September
Opinion.

Mylan and Alphapharm filed separate timely
appeals from the district court's judgment. The appeals
were consolidated on December 17, 2007. We
have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
1295(a)(1).
DISCUSSION
A. Exceptional Case Finding
[1] 35 U.S.C.  285 provides that a trial court
in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney
fees to the prevailing party. The decision to
award attorney fees is within the discretion of the
trial judge, but the conclusion that a case is exceptional
is a finding of fact reviewable only for clear
error. Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. LKB Produkter
AB, 892 F.2d 1547, 1551 (Fed.Cir.1989). We address
the arguments of the appellants with regard to
the district court's finding of an exceptional case individually.
1. Alphapharm
On appeal, Alphapharm argues that its Paragraph
IV letter was not baseless under structural
obviousness law. Alphapharm asserts that its certification
letter *1386 made out a prima facie case of
obviousness and that, contrary to what the district
court held, Alphapharm was not required to explain
why a skilled artisan would have identified compound
b as the lead compound in its certification
letter. As evidence of what it argues was a reasonable
chance to succeed, Alphapharm points to
Judge Dyk's concurrence in the prior decision of
this court. Alphapharm also argues that the fact that
its original theory did not prevail at trial falls far
short of clear and convincing evidence required for
the district court to find that its certification letter
was baseless. Alphapharm further claims that affirming
the district court's ruling would chill challenges
by generic drug companies to otherwise invalid
patents by requiring the inclusion of every
possible theory of invalidity in a certification letter
rather than allowing an ANDA filer to develop its
theories during the course of discovery. Similarly,
Alphapharm argues that the district court erred in
finding litigation misconduct because Alphapharm
consistently argued an obviousness theory and
merely honed its arguments in response to documents
produced during discovery by Takeda. Alphapharm
also disagrees with the court's characterization
of certain of its evidence as an attempt to inject
an inequitable conduct argument into the obviousness
inquiry.
Alphapharm and Mylan are supported in this
appeal by amicus curiae, the Generic Pharmaceutical
Association, who submitted a brief and was permitted
to orally argue before the court. Amicus argues
that failure to reverse the district court's finding
of an exceptional case would deter generic applicants
from presenting defenses at trial that were
not included in their certification letters. Amicus
asserts that changing defenses is normal conduct
during litigation, especially in patent cases, when
ANDA applicants prepare certification letters
without the benefit of discovery. As a result,
amicus argues, ANDA filers should be allowed to
litigate the best available theories at trial, regardless
of their inclusion in certification letters. Amicus asserts
that if the district court decision stands, it will
have a chilling effect on future ANDA patent challenges.
Takeda responds that Alphapharm's argument,
that it should benefit from a presumption of obviousness
based on structural considerations, has
already been rejected by this court. In addition,
Takeda points out that Alphapharm's certification
letter included scientific errors and that Judge Dyk's
concurrence did not address the claim of the '777
patent specific to pioglitazone, the invalidity of
which was necessary for Alphapharm's success. Finally,
Takeda asserts that the record amply supports
the district court's finding that Alphapharm presented
constantly shifting, but always baseless, obviousness
arguments. That finding, Takeda argues,
supports the court's conclusion that Alphapharm's
obviousness theories never had a good faith basis
and thus warranted an exceptional case finding.
As noted by Takeda, we have already held that
the district court did not commit reversible error by
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381)
refusing to apply a presumption of motivation to select
compound b as the lead compound based on
structural obviousness. See Takeda, 492 F.3d at
1360. Accordingly, although Alphapharm made
brief reference to compound b in its Paragraph IV
letter, it failed to provide any reason in its Paragraph
IV letter to identify compound b as the lead
compound and thus did not make out a prima facie
case of obviousness based on the structural similarity
between compound b and pioglitazone. Any
support Alphapharm hopes to gain from Judge
Dyk's concurrence is moreover lacking, as his opinion
addressed the possible overbreadth*1387 of two
claims in the ' 777 patent and not, as Alphapharm
claims, structural obviousness based on the prior
disclosure of compound b. Id. at 1364 (Dyk, J.,
concurring).
Furthermore, although it seems reasonable to
expect assertions of invalidity based on prior art to
remain relatively consistent as the prior art should
be known when the certification of invalidity is
made, we do not believe that the district court faulted
Alphapharm simply for changing its obviousness
argument at trial from the theory advanced in
the Paragraph IV letter. Rather, the court methodically
examined a number of shortcomings in Alphapharm's
Paragraph IV letter, which were made
obvious by Alphapharm's constantly shifting set of
arguments, that supported the finding that the certification
was baseless. September Opinion, 459
F.Supp.2d at 236. The court noted the stark contrast
between Alphapharm's focus on compound b as the
lead compound at trial with its discussion in the
certification letter of two other compounds disclosed
in Sohda II and how, as a result, Alphapharm
did not grapple with the many impediments
evident in Sohda II for choosing compound
(b) as a lead compound. Id. The court also catalogued
scientific errors in Alphapharm's certification
letter that the court saw as insidious and as
underscoring that Alphapharm did not act with due
care or in good faith in filing its certification. Id.
at 237. The court found that other assertions in Alphapharm's
Paragraph IV letter were baseless because
of undisputed evidence of pioglitazone's superiority
and that Alphapharm abandoned these arguments
at trial because they were unsupportable,
not because Alphapharm made a tactical decision
regarding which argument should be emphasized at
trial. Id. at 238. The court concluded that the deficiencies
in Alphapharm's Paragraph IV letter were
so glaring that they highlighted that Alphapharm
acted in bad faith in filing its Paragraph IV certification.
Id. at 239.
The court also discussed in depth what it saw
as Alphapharm's litigation misconduct. The court
traced the many iterations of Alphapharm's theory
of obviousness and pointed to Alphapharm's utter
failure to account for the identification of compound
b as the lead compound as required under
structural obviousness law. Id. at 241. The court
reasoned that Alphapharm had over two years to
develop its obviousness arguments in its Paragraph
IV letter, and its failure to explain why its Statement
was so flawed and why its description of obviousness
went through such a dramatic evolution
was overwhelming evidence of Alphapharm's bad
faith. Id. at 243. Finally, the court discussed assertions
made by Alphapharm that were unrelated to
the obviousness claim and created confusion,
wasted valuable court time, and increased the burden
of the litigation on the parties. Id. When considering
the totality of the circumstances, the court
stated bluntly, This case was not close. Id. at 244.
The court's conviction in its findings could hardly
be clearer.
A number of different circumstances may support
the finding of an exceptional case, including
vexatious or unjustified litigation or frivolous
suit, of which there must be clear and convincing
evidence. Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1551. Indeed, one
of the purposes of  285 is to prevent  gross injustice
when the accused infringer has litigated in
bad faith. Id. at 1552. In Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical
Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., we stated
that [t]he joint operation of  271(e) and 285 require
the paragraph (2) infringer to display care and

regard for the strict standards of the Hatch-Waxman
Act when challenging patent validity.... *1388 The
Hatch-Waxman Act thus imposes a duty of care on
an ANDA certifier. 231 F.3d 1339, 1347
(Fed.Cir.2000). Alphapharm now argues that
Yamanouchi's duty of care language lays out a
simple negligence standard. Alphapharm further
contends that this standard conflicts with Beckman,
which, Alphapharm argues, establishes the far higher
threshold of gross negligence. Alphapharm is incorrect
on both points.
In the first place, Beckman does not set out a
gross negligence standard. In Beckman, we stated
that  285 prevents gross injustice where a party
has demonstrated bad faith and misconduct during
litigation. Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1553. In addition,
Yamanouchi does not establish a simple negligence
standard, nor did the district court in this case apply
such a standard. Although Yamanouchi states that
ANDA applicants owe a duty of care under the
Hatch-Waxman Act, it explained that applicants fail
to meet this duty when they file baseless certifications.
231 F.3d at 1347. Thus, Yamanouchi does
not stand for the proposition that ANDA applicants
who are merely negligent can trigger  285.
[2][3] In this case, the district court correctly
found that Alphapharm's filing would amount to litigation
misconduct supporting an exceptional case
finding if it were baseless and if it fail[ed] to
present even a prima facie case of invalidity in filing
the paragraph IV certification. September
Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 232. Thus, the trial court
did not apply a simple negligence standard but
found Alphapharm's filing baseless. Moreover,
the trial court found misconduct during litigation.
Given the district court's familiarity with the parties
and the issues and its thorough discussion of Alphapharm's
certification letter and litigation
strategy, we cannot say that the court committed
clear error in finding that this was an exceptional
case due in part to the misconduct of Alphapharm.
See Beckman, 892 F.2d at 1552 & n. 1 (noting that
the district judge was in the best position to mon
itor litigation strategy and find bad faith).
2. Mylan
On appeal, Mylan argues that the district court
based its finding of an exceptional case against
Mylan on conjecture rather than requiring Takeda
to show clear and convincing evidence. As support
for its position, Mylan points to its decision not to
pursue the same arguments at trial as in its Paragraph
IV letter, arguing that because Mylan's original
invalidity theory was never pursued, the court
had to rely on speculation in finding the certification
letter baseless. Mylan also asserts that its decision
to amend its defenses to include a revised
obviousness claim and an inequitable conduct claim
did not constitute litigation misconduct or demonstrate
bad faith because it is customary to develop
defenses during discovery. Mylan argues that the
fact that it ultimately did not win on these claims
does not render this case exceptional. Furthermore,
Mylan asserts that the district court's decision to allow
Mylan to assert its inequitable conduct claim
demonstrates that it was not frivolous and thus was
not litigation misconduct.
Takeda responds by pointing to the district
court's analysis of the evidence regarding Mylan's
certification letter and litigation misconduct. Takeda
notes Mylan's error in characterizing compound
14 and pioglitazone as bioisosteres in its Paragraph
IV letter, which certified that pioglitazone was obvious
based on the disclosure of compound 14 in
the '200 patent and Sohda II. Takeda argues that
this invalidity argument was so devoid of merit that
Mylan did not pursue this obviousness *1389 claim
in discovery and abandoned it before trial. Takeda
then argues that Mylan suddenly asserted a revised
obviousness theory centering on compound 3894
that was similarly fraught with scientific errors.
With regard to Mylan's inequitable conduct claim,
Takeda asserts that this claim was also frivolous, as
Mylan completely failed to present any evidence of
intent to deceive the PTO, and notes that the court
specifically stated that allowing Mylan to amend its
defenses to include inequitable conduct did not

(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381)
mean that the amendment was timely or meritorious.
[4] We conclude that the court did not commit
clear error in finding that Mylan's misconduct contributed
to this being an exceptional case. In fact,
Mylan's invalidity argument in its certification letter
appears even more baseless than Alphapharm's.
Mylan certified that pioglitazone was rendered obvious
because Takeda had already disclosed compound
14, which had high efficacy, and simply replaced
its benzene ring with a pyridine ring, which
it described as a bioisostere, to create pioglitazone.
But Mylan's Rule 30(b)(6) designee testified that no
reason existed to choose compound 14 as the lead
compound; Takeda's expert emphatically disagreed
with the assertion that benzene and pyridine rings
are bioisosteres; and Alphapharm's expert testified
that the properties of compound 14 taught nothing
with respect to pyridines. We find it unsurprising,
therefore, that the district court characterized
Mylan's defense of the merits of its Paragraph IV
letter as utterly frivolous. September Opinion,
459 F.Supp.2d at 247. In light of the scientific errors
present in Mylan's certification letter, the fact
that the court was unmoved by Mylan's decision not
to pursue this obviousness claim at trial can hardly
be deemed clear error. We believe the court had
ample reason to hold that Mylan's certification letter
was filed in bad faith and with no reasonable
basis to claim the '777 patent invalid.
Similarly, the finding that Mylan engaged in
litigation misconduct was well-supported and explained
by the district court. The court deemed
Mylan's later argument based on compound 3894 to
be extremely misleading. Id. at 247. In addition,
the court discussed Takeda's seven asserted separate
grounds for litigation misconduct committed by
Mylan in its pursuit of an inequitable conduct
claim. As Takeda points out, the district court
stated that its decision to allow Mylan to bring its
claim of inequitable conduct was absolutely not a
finding that it was timely or meritorious. Id. at
249. Accordingly, the court found that the inequitable
conduct claim was always frivolous and unsupported,
as Mylan did not present any evidence
that Takeda hid or misrepresented any information
to the PTO. Id. We do not find persuasive Mylan's
argument that the district court took issue with the
mere fact that Mylan changed its theory of invalidity
and then lost. Rather, the court determined that
Mylan's initial certification letter was completely
baseless and that the claims Mylan offered as substitutes
were similarly frivolous. In short, the district
court, which was in the best position to evaluate
the entire strategy pursued by Mylan, did not
commit clear error in finding litigation misconduct.
Finally, we find the chilling argument regarding
ANDA filers advanced by Alphapharm and
Mylan to be unpersuasive, despite the support
provided by the amicus filing of the Generic Pharmaceutical
Association. In making a Paragraph IV
certification, appellants are statutorily required to
include a detailed statement of the factual and legal
basis of the opinion of the applicant that the patent
is invalid. 21 U.S.C.  355(j)(2)(B)(iv)(II)
(2006). It *1390 is clear from the district court's
opinion that it was not faulting Alphapharm or
Mylan for the act of filing an ANDA that challenged
the pioglitazone patent, nor did it limit the
filers to the theories raised in their certification letters.
Rather, the district court found the case exceptional
based on the specific circumstances involved
in this case, viz., baseless certification letters compounded
with litigation misconduct. In fact, the
court addressed the deterrence argument directly:
There is no basis to find that this award of fees
will deter ANDA filings and litigation. This
award addresses baseless ANDA filings and the
pursuit of frivolous ANDA litigation in bad faith
and other litigation misconduct. The Hatch-
Waxman Act cannot be read to immunize such
conduct.
September Opinion, 459 F.Supp.2d at 251.
Given the court's specific articulation that its ruling
was directed toward baseless ANDA filings and litigation
in bad faith, we decline to disturb the court's

finding of an exceptional case as potentially
chilling non-frivolous ANDA filings under the
Hatch-Waxman Act. Well-supported filings challenging
the validity and infringement of patents
owned by an NDA holder should not raise the
specter of an unjustified holding of an exceptional
case.
B. Amount of Award
[5][6] If a district court has not clearly erred in
finding a case exceptional, we review the award of
attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. Yamanouchi,
231 F.3d at 1346. The abuse of discretion
standard also applies to the district court's exercise
of its inherent power to award sanctions. Amsted Indus.
Inc. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co., 23 F.3d
374, 379 (Fed.Cir.1994). Under that standard, we
will affirm a district court unless its decision was
clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or fanciful, or
based on an erroneous conclusion of law or fact.
Yamanouchi, 231 F.3d at 1346.
Appellants argue that Takeda's award request
was excessive for a litigation that lasted just two
years and culminated in a nine-day trial. They point
to Takeda's billing entries and expenses as excessive
and inadequately supported in arguing that the
district court abused its discretion by not reducing
the award from the requested amount. Mylan also
argues that the court abused its discretion in failing
to consider opinions of Mylan's experts regarding
the reasonableness of the award and that the court
had no basis for its two-thirds allocation of the fee
award to Mylan. Finally, both Alphapharm and
Mylan assert that the additional sanctions of expert
fees and expenses were unjustified because there
was no evidence of fraud or abuse of the judicial
process.
Takeda responds that the district court examined
all relevant factors in determining the
amount of attorney fees, including the time entries
and staffing of the litigation. Takeda also points to
the court's analysis of Mylan's expert declarations
and its reasoning for the allocation of the award in
asserting that both decisions fell within the court's
discretion. With regard to the expert fees, Takeda
argues that the court had the discretion to impose a
sanction because of the appellants' bad faith and
vexatious conduct during the litigation.
[7] Although the award of the total amount of a
fee request is unusual, we have stated that such an
award may be imposed and affirmed. See Beckman,
892 F.2d at 1553 ([W]e can certainly imagine a
case in which litigation misconduct would justify
an award of attorney fees for the entire litigation.).
That determination lies within the discretion of the
trial judge, who is in the best position to know
how severely [a party's] misconduct has affected
*1391 the litigation. Id. Here, the district court left
no doubt as to its opinion of the litigation and work
performed by counsel. The court characterized the
work of Takeda's counsel as uniformly excellent
and determined that the attorney fee award was
reasonable. March Opinion, 2007 WL 840368, at
*4. Indeed, the court indicated that an even higher
award would have been justified. The court found
that none of the attacks on the size of the fee award
had merit, and the court also gave specific reasons
for disregarding Mylan's purported expert opinions,
including a lack of experience on the part of the declarants
with both the present litigation and patent
litigation as a whole. Furthermore, the court explained
its allocation of two-thirds of the fee burden
to Mylan because it acted as lead defense counsel
for discovery of the obviousness claims and then
added considerably to the complexity of the case
with an untimely assertion of an inequitable conduct
claim. Given the court's reasoned analysis and
familiarity with the litigation, we do not believe
that the court abused its discretion with its award of
attorney fees and related expenses. See Mathis v.
Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 759 (Fed.Cir.1988) (allowing
for the award of expenses under  285).
[8][9] As for the award of expert fees, a district
court may invoke its inherent power to impose
sanctions in the form of reasonable expert fees in
excess of what is provided for by statute. See
Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 50, 111

F.2d at 759 (noting that full expert witness fees
have been awarded, without specific statutory authorization,
upon a finding of bad faith). The use
of this inherent power is reserved for cases with a
finding of fraud or abuse of the judicial process.
Amsted, 23 F.3d at 378. While it is true that the appellants'
conduct did not amount to fraud, courts
may use sanctions in cases involving bad faith that
cannot be otherwise reached by rules or statutes.
See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 46, 111 S.Ct. 2123
(discussing cases). Here, the court below could not
award expert fees under  285, but it was entitled to
use its inherent powers to award Takeda the expert
fees. Because of the court's numerous articulations
of appellants' bad faith and vexatious litigation conduct,
we cannot say that the decision to do so was
an abuse of discretion.
We have considered the other arguments raised
by appellants and find them unpersuasive.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, we affirm the district court's finding
of an exceptional case and the award to Takeda
of $16,800,000 for attorney fees, expenses, and expert
fees, plus interest.
AFFIRMED
BRYSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and
concurring in the result in part.
I agree that the district court did not abuse its
discretion in awarding Takeda attorney fees. As a
practical matter, the task of determining whether a
case is exceptional within the meaning of 35
U.S.C.  285 so as to justify an award of attorney
fees is necessarily committed almost entirely to the
judgment of the district court. A district judge who
has lived with a case and the lawyers for an extended
period (four years in this case) is infinitely better
situated than we are to make the kind of holistic
judgments about the parties' conduct of the litigation
that are required to assess whether the case
should be treated as exceptional and whether fees
should be awarded. Where the trial court applies the
proper legal standards and conducts a thorough review
of the circumstances *1392 bearing upon the
section 285 inquiry, there is little room for a reviewing
court to second-guess the trial court's judgment.
In this case, the trial judge's analysis was
thorough and her finding that the case was exceptional
was not based on the application of an erroneous
legal standard. Under these circumstances, I
agree with my colleagues that we cannot overturn
the court's judgment as to the applicability of sanctions
under section 285.
With respect to the portion of the award attributable
to expert witness fees, I would uphold the
award, but on a narrow ground and with reservations.
As the district court correctly understood, expert
witness fees cannot be awarded as a sanction
under section 285. For that reason, the court invoked
the court's inherent authority to justify the
award of expert witness fees. See Chambers v.
NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115
L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). While we have recognized that
district courts can award expert fees in patent cases
under their inherent authority, we have made clear
that not every case qualifying as exceptional under
section 285 will qualify for sanctions under the
court's inherent power. Amsted Indus. Inc. v. Buckeye
Steel Castings Co., 23 F.3d 374, 378
(Fed.Cir.1994). To the contrary, a district court
may resort to its inherent power to impose sanctions
only in those highly unusual cases in which
the pertinent statutory remedies are plainly inadequate
to address the misconduct at issue. Amsted,
23 F.3d at 379 (The court should resort to its inherent
power only where the rules or statutes do not
reach the acts which degrade the judicial system....
[C]ourts should only resort to further sanctions
when misconduct remains unremedied by those initial
tools.); see also Martin v. Brown, 63 F.3d
1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995) ( inherent power should
be reserved for those cases in which the conduct of
a party or an attorney is egregious and no other
basis for sanctions exists); In re Rimsat, Ltd., 212
F.3d 1039, 1048 (7th Cir.2000). Routine use of inherent
authority to impose sanctions in addition to

those authorized by applicable statutes risks contravening
Congress's judgment as to what sanctions
are appropriate for particular misconduct. See, e.g.,
Corley v. Rosewood Care Ctr., Inc., 142 F.3d 1041,
1059 (7th Cir.1998); Klein v. Stahl GMBH & Co.
Maschinefabrik, 185 F.3d 98, 110 n. 10 (3d
Cir.1999). Where, as here, the district court's award
of attorney fees under section 285 and expert witness
fees under its inherent authority are predicated
on the same conduct, the district court must offer a
reasoned explanation for why the award of attorney
fees and expenses under section 285 is not a sufficient
sanction for the conduct in question. See Corley,
142 F.3d at 1058-59 (The court also should
have explained why Rule 11 was inadequate to
serve the court's purposes....).
There are obviously different degrees of unjustifiable
conduct, and the district court must identify
the considerations that justify distinguishing
between inappropriate conduct redressable under
35 U.S.C.  284, 285 and egregious conduct which
justifies resort to the inherent power to sanction.
Amsted, 23 F.3d at 378. The problem is that the
standard required to justify invoking the court's inherent
authority to impose sanctions is extremely
vague. The standard articulated by the Supreme
Court permits a court to invoke its inherent powers
if the court determines that fraud has been practiced
upon it, or that the very temple of justice has
been defiled. In this case, there is no suggestion
that the defendants have engaged in fraudulent conduct.
Instead, the court upholds the award of expert
witness fees based on an abuse of judicial process,
i.e., the defiling the very temple of justice rationale.
Unfortunately, while that metaphor is colorful,
it does not make for a *1393 very useful legal
standard. What I take from the Supreme Court's
opinion in Chambers and our decision in Amsted is
that cases in which it will be considered appropriate
to impose inherent authority sanctions in addition
to those already imposed pursuant to statute or rule
will be very rare. Indeed, in Amsted we found that
the district court's exercise of its inherent power
was unjustified even though the accused infringer
continued to press its defenses knowing that they
were meritless, burdened the court with unnecessary
motions, and violated a court order. Amsted, 23
F.3d at 378-79. While we acknowledged in Amsted
that the sanctioned party had engaged in inappropriate
conduct, we held that it did not constitute
egregious conduct and bad faith of the sort necessary
to justify resort to the inherent power to
sanction. Id. at 379.
In this case, the district court found
overwhelming evidence of bad faith by Alphapharm
and found that Mylan engaged in a host
of bad faith litigation tactics, which increased the
burden of this litigation enormously. The court
further ruled that an award of the costs associated
with Takeda's employment of experts is particularly
warranted in this case because the defendants
knew that their attacks on Takeda's patent were
groundless and would only succeed if Takeda did
not expend the effort and resources necessary to
shine a light on the flaws in the defendants' arguments.
In my view, it is questionable whether that explanation,
even as supplemented by the court's detailed
analysis in its sanctions opinion of September
20, 2006, is sufficient to meet the requirement of a
satisfactory explanation for invoking the inherent
authority to award expert witness fees. However, it
is not necessary to decide that issue in this case, because
the district court made clear that the amount
of its overall award did not depend on the award of
expert witness fees. In its March 21, 2007, opinion,
the court remarked that Takeda would certainly be
fairly entitled to an enhancement of about $3 million,
with $2 million charged to Mylan and $1 million
charged to Alphapharm in light of Takeda's
success and to reflect the extensiveness of the misconduct
here, which prolonged and increased the
burden of the litigation on Takeda. Although the
court did not grant the enhancement, it stated that
an enhancement to the lodestar amount will not be
separately awarded because Takeda's expert fees
are also being awarded. The court thus made clear

549 F.3d 1381, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1218
(Cite as: 549 F.3d 1381)
that if it were not able to award expert witness fees,
it would grant the requested enhancement of the attorney
fees. For that reason, it is clear that the
award of expert witness fees, even if improper, did
not result in a greater total fee award than the court
otherwise would have imposed if it had been limited
to basing its assessment on section 285 alone.
FN1
I therefore concur in this court's action upholding
the district court's award to Takeda. That said,
however, I believe it is important to emphasize that
this case should not be viewed as an invitation for
district courts to impose inherent authority sanctions
liberally in patent cases, and that such awards,
even if appropriate in some cases, should be very
much the exception and not the rule.
FN1. Several of the expenses included in
the section 285 award would appear questionable
as reasonable expenditures necessary
to the prosecution of the case. Those
include, for example, [b]everages while
waiting at airport, client dinners, and late
fees for borrowed books. The appellants
have not focused on those items in their
briefs, however, and therefore I would not
require a remand for a specific justification
of those expenses.
