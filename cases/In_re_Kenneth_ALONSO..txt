Dr. Kenneth Alonso appeals a decision of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office Board
of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) sustaining
in part the examiner's final rejection of
claim 92 of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/469,749
('749 Application). In its decision, the Board reversed
the examiner's rejection of claim 92 for lack
of enablement and sustained the rejection as invalid
for lack of adequate written description. Ex parte
Alonso, No.2006-2148 (B.P.A.I. July 25, 2007) (
Decision ). We affirm.
I. BACKGROUND
An arsenal of antibodies generated by the immune
system defends the human body against illnesses
caused by bacteria and cancerous cells and
other invasive agents. Antibodies are large, Y-
shaped molecules secreted by white blood cells
known as B lymphocytes, or B-cells. Antibodies
are capable of binding to the surfaces of foreign
cells or other substances known as antigens. The
specific location on the surface of the antigen
where the antibody attaches is termed the
epitope. The arms of the Y-shaped molecule bind
to the epitope with specificity. Antibodies that bind
to the same epitope are said to have the same
idiotype. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are
derived from a single precursor and have a single
idiotype. They are produced using hybridoma
(fusion) technology. A human-to-human hybridoma
is created by fusing a human tumor cell to an antibody-
producing human B-cell, resulting in secretion
by the B-cell of monoclonal antibodies with
identical affinity and specificity to a given epitope
on the surface of the tumor cell.
On June 6, 1995, Dr. Alonso filed the '749 Application
entitled, Method of Producing Human-
Human Hybridomas, The Production of Monoclonal
and Polyclonal Antibodies Therefrom, and
FN1
Therapeutic Use Thereof. The claimed invention
recites*1018 a method for treating neurofibrosarcoma,
a rare cancer of the sheath of a peripheral
nerve, that uses human monoclonal antibodies
targeted at a patient's tumor. Claim 92 of the
'749 Application discloses
FN1. Alonso claimed priority to an application
he filed seven years earlier involving
similar subject matter.
[a] method of treating neurofibrosarcoma in a human
by administering an effective amount of a
monoclonal antibody idiotypic to the neurofibrosarcoma
of said human, wherein said
monoclonal antibody is secreted from a human-
human hybridoma derived from the neurofibrosarcoma
cells.
In Example 1 of the '749 Specification, Alonso
described the preparation of a tumor cell suspension
from the sample of a tumor and the subsequent
sensitization of human spleen cells. The sensitized

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 4
545 F.3d 1015, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1849
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1015)
spleen cells are fused with an immortalized cell line
(e.g., a fetal marrow line, a lymphoblastoid line, or
a plasma cell line from myeloma). The resulting
cells are screened for hybridomas that secrete antibodies
specifically reactive with the sensitizing tumor
cells (and non-reactive with a range of other
tissues and cell types). Example 2 disclosed the results
of an experiment conducted by Alonso in treating
Melanie Brown, a patient with neurofibrosarcoma.
Adult spleen cells were sensitized with cells
from Brown's tumor. The resulting hybridoma
secreted monoclonal antibodies, which reacted with
a 221 KiloDalton tumor surface antigen. The spleen
line (AS-151), the lymphoblast fusion line
(BM-95), and the hybridoma (HB983) were deposited
with the American Type Culture Collection in
September of 1998. The antibody from the hybridoma
line was deposited with the Food and Drug
FN2
Administration.
FN2. Alonso infused Brown with 100 mg
of the antibody, and cancerous lesions in
her lungs were cleared within twenty-four
hours. In addition, Brown's brain tumor became
necrotic within seven days, and she
experienced a one-month regression of her
cancer.
The examiner rejected claim 92 as lacking adequate
written descriptive support for the broad
genus of antibodies encompassed by the claim language.
Applicant is reminded that the disclosure only describes
the preparation of a single Mab produced
by the hybridoma cell line HB983. However, the
claims are directed toward a much larger genus of
molecules (i.e., Mabs that bind to a neurofibrosarcoma),
not a specific Mab identified by
the deposited hybridoma.... The crux of the rejection
is whether or not applicant has provided sufficient
support for the broadly claimed genus of
therapeutic antibodies. As set forth in the rejection,
the skilled artisan would reasonably conclude
that applicant was clearly not in possession
of the claimed genus of compounds. Applicant
should direct the claim language toward the only
described embodiment (e.g., a Mab produced by
hybridoma HB983).
The Board affirmed the rejection, agreeing that
Alonso had not adequately described the claimed
invention because the single antibody described in
the Specification is insufficiently representative to
provide adequate written descriptive support for the
genus of antibodies required to practice the claimed
invention. Decision, slip op. at 7.
II. DISCUSSION
[1][2][3][4] Whether an applicant has complied
with the written description requirement is a finding
of fact, to be analyzed from the perspective of
one of ordinary skill in the art as of the date of the
filing of the application. Regents of the Univ. of
Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559, 1566
(Fed.Cir.1997); *1019Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,
935 F.2d 1555, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1991). This Court reviews
the Board's factual determinations under a
substantial evidence standard. In re Gartside, 203
F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2000). Substantial evidence
is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
Id. at 1312 (citation omitted). In making the assessment,
we examine the record as a whole, taking into
account evidence that both justifies and detracts
from an agency's decision. Id. That a fact finder
could draw two inconsistent conclusions from the
evidence does not prevent an administrative
agency's finding from being supported by substantial
evidence. Id. (citation omitted). Rather, the
Board's decision must be affirmed if any
reasonable fact finder could have arrived at the
[same] decision. Id.
[5] The written description requirement of 35
U.S.C.  112,  1, is straightforward: The specification
shall contain a written description of the invention....
To satisfy this requirement, the specification
must describe the invention in sufficient
detail so that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude
that the inventor invented the claimed invention
as of the filing date sought. Lockwood v. Am.

v. Frank, 52 F.3d 1035, 1039 (Fed.Cir.1995).
[6][7] The requirement serves a teaching function,
as a quid pro quo  in which the public is given
meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded
from practicing the invention for a limited
period of time.  Univ. of Rochester v. G.D.
Searle & Co., Inc., 358 F.3d 916, 922
(Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen
FN3
Probe Inc., 323 F.3d 956, 970 (Fed.Cir.2002)).
The Board framed the issue raised by the '749 Application
as follows.
FN3. The requirement is rigorous, but not
exhaustive: [I]t is unnecessary to spell out
every detail of the invention in the specification;
only enough must be included to
convince a person of skill in the art that the
inventor possessed the invention. LizardTech,
424 F.3d at 1345.
[W]hether the single monoclonal antibody described
in the Specification is representative of
the genus of monoclonal antibodies required to
practice the claimed treatment method. That, in
turn, depends on whether or not the antibodies
(and the antigens they bind) would have been expected
to vary substantially within the genus. The
greater the variation in the genus, the less representative
any particular antibody would be.
Decision, slip op. at 6.
The Board properly characterized the relevant
genus as the genus of antibodies specific to neurofibrosarcoma
cells. Id. A genus can be described
by disclosing: (1) a representative number of species
in that genus; or (2) its relevant identifying
characteristics, such as complete or partial structure,
other physical and/or chemical properties,
functional characteristics when coupled with a
known or disclosed correlation between function
and structure, or some combination of such characteristics.
Enzo, 323 F.3d at 964.
Relying principally on two scientific articles,
including one authored by Alonso himself, the
Board determined that
[t]here is ample evidence of record that the specificities
of antibodies falling within the scope of
the genus (and the structures of the antigens they
bind) would be expected to vary substantially.
FN4
For example, Osband provides evidence
*1020 of a recognition in the art that considerable
antigenic heterogeneity of tumors both between
patients and metastatic sites within a single patient
is to be expected. In addition, an article au
FN5
thored by [Alonso] acknowledges that [t]he
efficacy of antibody therapy is thought to be related
to tumor burden as well as to idiotypic
change in the original tumor.  This acknowledged
heterogeneity is reflected in the goal of
the claimed method-to raise customized antibodies
to possibly unique antigens on a particular patient's
tumor.

Surface Antigen in the Treatment of

Finally, as discussed above, for purposes of satisfying
the written description requirement, it is not
enough merely to disclose a method of making
and identifying compounds capable of being used
to practice the claimed invention. That is, it is not
enough to describe[ ] the procedure for making a
human-human hybridoma from neurofibrosarcoma,
and teach how to determine whether a given
antibody, specific to a patient's neurofibrosarcoma,
will function in the claimed method. We
find that the single antibody described in the Specification
is insufficiently representative to

provide adequate written descriptive support for
the genus of antibodies required to practice the
claimed invention.
Decision, slip op. at 6-7 (internal quotation marks
and citations omitted, footnotes supplemented).
[8] The Board's conclusion is supported by
substantial evidence. The articles relied upon by the
Board confirm the hypothesis that the antibodies required
to perform Alonso's claimed method vary
substantially in their composition. We have previously
held in a similar context that a patentee of a
biotechnological invention cannot necessarily claim
a genus after only describing a limited number of
species because there may be unpredictability in the
results obtained from species other than those specifically
enumerated. Noelle v. Lederman, 355
F.3d 1343, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2004).
In another similar case, we evaluated claims
directed to a method of determining whether a drug
could selectively inhibit the activity of COX-2, a
cyclooxygenase thought to be responsible for inflammation
associated with arthritis. See Rochester,
358 F.3d at 917-18. One of the claims at issue was
directed to a method for selectively inhibiting
[COX-2] activity in a human host, comprising administering
a non-steroidal compound that selectively
inhibits activity of the [COX-2] gene product
to a human host in need of such treatment. Id. at
918. We found that the specification lacked written
descriptive support, agreeing with the district court
that
it is clear from reading the patent that one critical
aspect of the method-a compound that selectively
inhibits [COX-2] activity-was hypothetical, for it
is clear that the inventors had neither possession
nor knowledge of such a compound.... [T]he
claimed method depends upon finding a compound
that selectively inhibits [COX-2] activity.
Without such a compound, it is impossible to
practice the claimed method of treatment.
Id. at 926. We further noted that the specification
contained no disclosure of any method for
making even a single non-steroidal compound that
selectively inhibits *1021 activity of the [COX-2]
gene product,  and failed to steer the skilled
practitioner toward compounds that can be used to
carry out the claimed methods. Id. at 928, 929.
[9][10] Alonso attempts to distinguish his
claimed invention from Rochester by emphasizing
that he reduced his method to practice and identified
the resulting compound. We are not persuaded
by the distinction. [P]roof of a reduction to practice,
absent an adequate description in the specification
of what is reduced to practice, does not serve
to describe or identify the invention for purposes of
[the written description requirement]. Enzo, 323
FN6
F.3d at 969.Moreover, while it is true that
Rochester disclosed no compounds that worked
with the claimed method, the one compound disclosed
by Alonso cannot be said to be representative
of a densely populated genus.
FN6. The reduction-to-practice argument
also implicates  112's enablement requirement.
The Board reversed the examiner's
rejection of claim 92 for lack of enablement.
See Decision, slip op. at 12. Alonso
argues that the Board's findings as to sufficiency
of description and enablement are at
odds with one another. It is true that the
written description and enablement requirements
usually rise and fall together.
That is, a recitation of how to make and
use the invention across the full breadth of
the claim is ordinarily sufficient to demonstrate
that the inventor possesses the full
scope of the invention, and vice versa.
LizardTech, 424 F.3d at 1345. However,
we have been clear that [a]lthough the
legal criteria of enablement and written description
are related and are often met by
the same disclosure, they serve discrete
legal requirements. Capon v. Eshhar, 418
F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2005). [A]n invention
may be enabled even though it has
not been described. Rochester, 358 F.3d
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 7
545 F.3d 1015, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1849
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1015)
at 921.
In Rochester, we reasoned that while the specification
describes what can be done with any compounds
that may potentially be identified through those
assays, including formulation into pharmaceuticals,
routes of administration, estimation of effective
dosage, and suitable dosage forms ... the
'850 patent does not disclose just which peptides,
polynucleotides, and small organic molecules
have the desired characteristics of selectively inhibiting
[COX-2]. Without such disclosure the
claimed methods cannot be said to have been described.
Rochester, 358 F.3d at 927 (internal citation
and quotation marks omitted). We additionally
found that Rochester had failed to present any evidence
that one skilled in the art would have been
able to isolate and identify any given compound
based on Rochester's vague functional description....
Id. at 928. Even more recently, we held that
the written disclosure requirement was not met
where the claims at issue covered a broad genus of
recombinant plasmids that contain coding sequences
for DNA polymerase ... from any bacterial
source, [but] the narrow specifications of the
[relevant patents] only disclose[d] the ... gene coding
sequence from one bacterial source.... Carnegie
Mellon Univ. v. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 541
F.3d 1115, 1125 (Fed.Cir.2008) (emphasis added).
The same is true here. The specification of the
'749 Application does not characterize the antigens
to which the monoclonal antibodies must bind; it
discloses only the molecular weight of the one antigen
identified in Example 2. This is clearly insuffi
FN7
cient.The specification teaches nothing about
the structure, epitope characterization, binding affinity,
specificity, or pharmacological properties
common to the *1022 large family of antibodies
implicated by the method. While Alonso's claim is
written as a method, the antibodies themselves are
described in purely structural language-a mono
clonal antibody idiotypic to the neurofibrosarcoma
of said human. This sparse description of antibody
structure in the claim stands in stark contrast to the
detailed method of making the antibodies found in
the specification.
FN7. It bears mentioning that the examiner
encouraged Alonso to amend his claims to
cover only the MAb produced by the identified
hybridoma.
The Eli Lilly decision is also instructive. In Eli
Lilly, the University of California laid claim to all
vertebrate insulin cDNAs, including the human insulin
cDNA, although it had identified only the
cDNA for rat insulin. See Eli Lilly, 119 F.3d at
FN8
1567.We ruled that the written description requirement
was not met because a description of rat
insulin cDNA is not a description of the broad
classes of vertebrate or mammalian insulin cDNA.
Id. at 1568. As in Eli Lilly, the specification of the
'749 Application contains information about only
FN9
one compound.
FN8. The claims at issue in Eli Lilly were
directed to a recombinant plasmid replicable
in [a] procaryotic host containing
within its nucleotide sequence a subsequence
having the structure of the reverse
transcript of an mRNA of a vertebrate,
which mRNA encodes insulin. Eli
Lilly, 119 F.3d at 1563 (emphasis in original).
FN9. Alonso cites In re Herschler, 591
F.2d 693 (CCPA 1979), where our predecessor
court held that the disclosure of a
single corticosteroid was sufficient to describe
the genus of physiologically active
steroids that could be used in practicing the
claimed invention. The court based its decision
on the fact that the class of implicated
compounds was chemically quite
similar. Id. at 701. Alonso argues that the
same is true with respect to the antibodies
generated by a patient's specific neur

ofibrosarcoma. However, he points to no
evidence in the record corroborating his
similarity thesis.
Apart from the representative number of species
test applied by the Board, we have found adequate
written descriptive support for a claimed invention
where the disclosure specifies relevant
identifying characteristics, such as complete or
partial structure, other physical and/or chemical
properties, functional characteristics when coupled
with a known or disclosed correlation between
function and structure, or some combination of
such characteristics.  Enzo, 323 F.3d at 964
(emphasis in original). Alonso argues that there is a
well-known correlation between the structure and
function of the neurofibrosarcoma-specific antibodies
generated by his disclosed treatment method. He
maintains that the members of the genus of antibodies
directed to a particular patient's tumor share the
same function-they each bind to a patient's neurofibrosarcoma,
thereby bolstering the patient's immune
mechanism and stimulating an attack on the
tumor cells. As for structure, Alonso argues that because
monoclonal antibodies are secreted from a
hybridoma made from a particular neurofibrosarcoma,
the antibodies are necessarily specific. He
further argues that there is a well-known correlation
between human antibody structure and antibody
function.
Alonso did not raise this structure-function correlation
argument in the proceedings before the
Board. Failure to advance legal theories before the
[B]oard constitutes a failure to make a complete
presentation of the issues, and permitting a party to
raise those theories for the first time [after the
agency has rendered its final decision] would be
both inefficient and wasteful of administrative and
judicial resources.  Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc.
v. Medtronic Vascular, Inc., 497 F.3d 1293, 1298
(Fed.Cir.2007). Accordingly, we will not consider
FN10
this newly minted argument on appeal.
FN10. Even were we tempted to consider
the argument, Alonso would not be entitled
to relief. In Noelle, the applicant claimed a
human monoclonal antibody (or fragment
thereof) secreted from a particular hybridoma
that binds to an antigen expressed
on activated T-cells. The application did
not, however, disclose any structural information
about the human antigen.
Noelle, 355 F.3d at 1345-46. It described
only the mouse antigen. We concluded that
the function-structure correlation test was
not met.
If [the applicant] had sufficiently described
the human form of CD40CR antigen,
he could have claimed its antibody
by simply stating its binding affinity for
the fully characterized antigen. [The
applicant] did not describe human
CD40CR antigen. Therefore, [the applicant]
attempted to define an unknown by
its binding affinity to another unknown.
Noelle, 355 F.3d at 1349. As Alonso has
not pointed to any structure for his
claimed antibodies, there is no structure
to which he may correlate the function
of his claimed antibodies.
*1023 III. CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, the decision of
the Board is affirmed.
AFFIRMED.
