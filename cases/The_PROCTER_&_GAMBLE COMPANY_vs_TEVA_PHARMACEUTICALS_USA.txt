Appellant.
Nos. 2008-1404, 2008-1405, 2008-1406.
May 13, 2009.
Background: Owner of patent claiming compound
risedronate, the active ingredient of an osteoporosis
drug, brought infringement action against competitor.
The United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., J., 536
F.Supp.2d 476, in a bench trial, entered judgment in
favor of patent owner. Competitor appealed.
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Huff, District
Judge, sitting by designation, held that:
(1) district court did not clearly err in finding that
competitor failed to establish prima facie case of
obviousness;
(2) district court did not commit clear error in concluding
that secondary considerations supported a
finding of non-obviousness of patent claiming
risedronate;
(3) patent claiming an intermittent dosing method
for treating osteoporosis qualified as prior art; and
(4) patent claiming risedronate was not invalid
based on obviousness-type double patenting.
Affirmed.

Granting patent protection to advances that
would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation
retards progress; in other cases, though,
researchers can only vary all parameters or try each
of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrives
at a successful result, where the prior art gives
either no indication of which parameters are critical
or no direction as to which of many possible
choices is likely to be successful, and in such cases,

Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) appeals
from a final judgment of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware in favor
of The Procter & Gamble Company (P & G) in
three cases upholding the validity of P & G's U.S.
Patent 5,583,122 (the '122 patent ). Procter &
Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,
536 F.Supp.2d 476 (D.Del.2008). After a bench trial
and a stipulation for judgment in the related
cases, the district court rejected Teva's invalidity
defenses of obviousness and obviousness-type
double patenting. We affirm.
I. BACKGROUND
The '122 patent claims the compound risedronate,
the active ingredient of P & G's osteoporosis
drug Actonel. In August 2004, P & G sued Teva
for infringement of the '122 patent after Teva notified
P & G that it planned to market risedronate as
a generic equivalent of Actonel. Specifically, P &
G alleged that Teva's proposed drug infringed claim
4 of the '122 patent for the compound risedronate,
claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing
risedronate, and claim 23 for methods of
treating diseases using risedronate. In its defense,
Teva argued that the '122 *993 patent was invalid
as obvious in light of P & G's expired U.S. Patent
4,761,406 (the '406 patent), filed on June 6, 1985
and issued on August 2, 1988. Alternately, Teva argues
that the '122 patent is invalid for obviousness-
type double patenting.
Risedronate, the subject of the contested
claims, is a member of a group of compounds referred
to as bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates, in
general, are active in inhibiting bone resorption.
The first two promising bisphosphonates studied
for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases, etidronate
(EHDP) and clodronate, had clinical problems
which prevented their commercialization. P & G
conducted a significant amount of experimentation
involving hundreds of different bisphosphonate
compounds, but could not predict the efficacy or
toxicity of the new compounds. Eventually, researchers
at P & G identified risedronate as a promising
drug candidate.
On December 6, 1985, risedronate's inventors
applied for a patent on the compound. P & G is the
owner by assignment of the '122 patent, entitled
Pharmaceutical Compositions Containing Geminal
Diphosphonates, which issued on December 10,
1996.
Risedronate is neither claimed nor disclosed in
the '406 patent. Instead, the '406 patent, entitled
Regimen for Treating Osteoporosis, claims an intermittent
dosing method for treating osteoporosis.
As the trial court noted, the '406 patent addresses
the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the
time, namely that they inhibited bone mineralization,
by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative
regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect
of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of
anti-mineralization in patients. Procter & Gamble,
536 F.Supp.2d at 492. The ' 406 patent lists thirty-
six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment can

didates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent
dosing, including 2-pyr EHDP. Teva contends
that the structural similarities between risedronate
and 2-pyr EHDP render the challenged claims of
the '122 patent obvious.
From the testimony at trial, the district court
concluded that the ' 406 patent would not have led a
person of ordinary skill in the art to identify 2-pyr
EHDP as the lead compound. In light of the extremely
unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at
the time of the invention, the district court also
found that a person of ordinary skill in the art
would not have been motivated to make the specific
molecular modifications to make risedronate. The
district court concluded that unexpected results of
risedronate's potency and toxicity rebut a claim of
obviousness. The district court found that secondary
considerations of non-obviousness supported its
conclusions. Similarly, the court found that the '122
patent was not invalid for obviousness-type double
patenting. This consolidated appeal followed. We
have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
1295(a)(1).
II. DISCUSSION
I. Standard of Review
[1][2][3][4][5] On appeal from a bench trial,
this court reviews the district court's conclusions of
law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.
Golden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson Co., 365
F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.Cir.2004). Whether the subject
matter of a patent is obvious is a question of
law and is reviewed de novo. PharmaStem Therapeutics,
Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 1359
(Fed.Cir.2007). Factual determinations underlying
the obviousness issue are reviewed for clear error.
Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 464 F.3d 1286,
1289 (Fed.Cir.2006). The evidentiary burden to
show facts supporting a *994 conclusion of invalidity
is one of clear and convincing evidence. AK
Steel Corp. v. Sollac & Ugine, 344 F.3d 1234,
1238-39 (Fed.Cir.2003). Non-statutory double patenting
is a legal question reviewed without deference.
Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Gypsum Co.,
195 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed.Cir.1999).
II. Patent Obviousness-Legal Standard
[6][7] Under the U.S. Patent Act, an invention
cannot be patented if the subject matter as a whole
would have been obvious at the time the invention
was made to a person having ordinary skill in the
art to which said subject matter pertains. 35 U.S.C.
103(a). Patents are presumed to be valid. Kao
Corp. v. Unilever U.S., Inc., 441 F.3d 963, 968
(Fed.Cir.2006). A party seeking to invalidate a patent
based on obviousness must demonstrate by
clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan
would have been motivated to combine the teachings
of the prior art references to achieve the
claimed invention, and that the skilled artisan
would have had a reasonable expectation of success
in doing so. Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d
1348, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2007). Clear and convincing
evidence places in the fact finder an abiding conviction
that the truth of [the] factual contentions are
highly probable. Colorado v. New Mexico, 467
U.S. 310, 316, 104 S.Ct. 2433, 81 L.Ed.2d 247
(1984) (quotation marks omitted).
[8][9] The obviousness determination turns on
underlying factual inquiries involving: (1) the scope
and content of prior art, (2) differences between
claims and prior art, (3) the level of ordinary skill
in pertinent art, and (4) secondary considerations
such as commercial success and satisfaction of a
long-felt need. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383
U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966).
The Supreme Court has explained that the Federal
Circuit's teaching, suggestion or motivation test
provides helpful insight into the obviousness question
as long as it is not applied rigidly. KSR Int'l
Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727,
1741, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). Accordingly, under
KSR, it remains necessary to identify some reason
that would have led a chemist to modify a known
compound in a particular manner to establish prima
facie obviousness of a new claimed compound.

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989)
[10] If a patent challenger makes a prima facie
showing of obviousness, the owner may rebut based
on unexpected results by demonstrating that the
claimed invention exhibits some superior property
or advantage that a person of ordinary skill in the
relevant art would have found surprising or unexpected.
In re Soni, 54 F.3d 746, 750
(Fed.Cir.1995). We consider the relevant factors in
turn.
III. Identification of a Lead Compound
[11] An obviousness argument based on structural
similarity between claimed and prior art compounds
clearly depends on a preliminary finding
that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected
[the prior art compound] as a lead compound.
Takeda, 492 F.3d at 1359; see also Eisai
Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs., Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353,
1359 (Fed.Cir.2008) (stating that post-KSR, a
prima facie case of obviousness for a chemical
compound still, in general, begins with the reasoned
identification of a lead compound in the prior art).
Teva argues that the '406 patent identifies 2-pyr
EHDP as the most promising molecule for the inhibition
of bone resorption. The trial court disagreed
and concluded from the evidence that a *995
person of ordinary skill in the art would not have
identified 2-pyr EHDP as a lead compound for the
treatment of osteoporosis.
We need not reach this question because we
conclude that even if 2-pyr EHDP was a lead compound,
the evidence does not establish that it would
have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at
the time of the invention to modify 2-pyr EHDP to
create risedronate.
IV. Obviousness of Risedronate in Light of the
Prior Art
[12] To decide whether risedronate was obvious
in light of the prior art, a court must determine
whether, at the time of invention, a person having
ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to
attempt to make the composition known as risedronate
and a reasonable expectation of success in
doing so. PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. Via-
Cell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007).
The district court concluded that, even if 2-pyr
EHDP were a lead compound, it would not render
the '122 patent's claims on risedronate obvious because
a person having ordinary skill in the art
would not have had reason to make risedronate
based on the prior art. The district court's findings
also support the conclusion that there could have
been no reasonable expectation as to risedronate's
success.
[13] The question of obviousness often turns
on the structural similarities and differences
between the claimed compound and the prior art
compound[ ]. Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs.,
Ltd., 533 F.3d 1353, 1356-57 (Fed.Cir.2008); see
also Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d
1075, 1086 (Fed.Cir.2008) (Precedent establishes
the analytical procedure whereby a close structural
similarity between a new chemical compound and
prior art compounds is generally deemed to create a
prima facie case of obviousness....); In re Mayne,
104 F.3d 1339, 1343 (Fed.Cir.1997) ( Structural
relationships often provide the requisite motivation
to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds.);
In re Payne, 606 F.2d 303, 313-15
(CCPA 1979) (discussing the presumption of obviousness
based on close structural similarity). In this
case, risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP are positional
isomers; they each contain the same atoms arranged
in different ways. In risedronate, the hydroxyethanediphosphonate
group is connected to the # 3
carbon of a pyridine ring, while in 2-pyr EHDP, the
hydroxy-ethane-diphosphonate group is connected
to the # 2 carbon. Because the nitrogen atom is in a
different position in the two molecules, they differ
in three dimensional shape, charge distribution and
hydrogen bonding properties.
[14][15][16] To successfully argue that a new
compound is obvious, the challenger may show
that the prior art would have suggested making the
specific molecular modifications necessary to
achieve the claimed invention. Takeda, 492 F.3d
at 1356 (quotation marks omitted). In keeping

with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry,
the requisite motivation [to modify] can come from
any number of sources. Eisai, 533 F.3d at 1357
(citation omitted). Thus, in addition to structural
similarity between the compounds, a prima facie
case of obviousness may be shown by adequate
support in the prior art for the change in structure.
In re Grabiak, 769 F.2d 729, 731-32 (Fed.Cir.1985)
. As we noted in Takeda:
A known compound may suggest its homolog,
analog, or isomer because such compounds often
have similar properties and therefore chemists of
ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making
them to try to obtain compounds with *996
improved properties.... [However,] it remains necessary
to identify some reason that would have
led a chemist to modify a known compound in a
particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness
of a new claimed compound.
492 F.3d at 1356-57 (citation omitted).
At trial, P & G's expert witnesses testified that,
in 1985, a person having ordinary skill in the art
realized that the properties of bisphosphonates
could not be anticipated based on their structure.
Additionally, the trial court relied on contemporaneous
writings from Herbert Fleisch, the preeminent
authority on bisphosphonates during the relevant
time period. Dr. Fleisch wrote in 1984 that every
compound, while remaining a bisphosphonate, exhibits
its own physical-chemical, biological and
therapeutic characteristics, so that each bisphosphonate
has to be considered on its own. To infer
from one compound the effects in another is dangerous
and can be misleading. Herbert Fleisch,
Chemistry and Mechanisms of Action of Bisphosphonates,
in Bone Resorption, Metastasis, and Diphosphonates
33-40 (S. Garattini ed., 1985). In this
case, P & G synthesized and tested 2-pyr EHDP,
risedronate (3-pyr EHDP) and 4-pyr EHDP, another
structural isomer. Confirming the unpredictability
of bisphosphonates, test results for 4-pyr EHDP revealed
that it was not active in inhibiting bone resorption
despite its close relationship with potent
compounds. In light of the Supreme Court's instruction
in KSR, the Federal Circuit has stated that,
[t]o the extent an art is unpredictable, as the chemical
arts often are, KSR's focus on [ ] identified,
predictable solutions' may present a difficult hurdle
because potential solutions are less likely to be
genuinely predictable. Eisai, 533 F.3d 1353, 1359
(quoting KSR, 127 S.Ct. at 1742). The district court
found that Teva failed to clear that hurdle, establishing
insufficient motivation for a person of ordinary
skill to synthesize and test risedronate. This
finding was not clearly erroneous.
[17] Additionally, there was an insufficient
showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art
would have had a reasonable expectation of success
in synthesizing and testing risedronate. PharmaStem,
491 F.3d at 1360. In KSR, the Supreme
Court stated that when an obvious modification
leads to the anticipated success, the invention is
likely the product of ordinary skill and is obvious
under 35 U.S.C.  103. 127 S.Ct. at 1742.
[O]bviousness cannot be avoided simply by a
showing of some degree of unpredictability in the
art so long as there was a reasonable probability of
success. Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364 (citing In re
Corkill, 771 F.2d 1496, 1500 (Fed.Cir.1985)). Here,
the district court's findings indicate that there was
no reasonable expectation in 1985 that risedronate
would be a successful compound.
[18][19][20] Cases following KSR have considered
whether a given molecular modification
would have been carried out as part of routine testing.
See, e.g., Takeda, 492 F.3d at 1360 (discussing
the district court's finding that a modification was
not known to be beneficial and was not considered
routine). When a person of ordinary skill is faced
with a finite number of identified, predictable
solutions to a problem and pursues the known options
within his or her technical grasp, the resulting
discovery is likely the product not of innovation
but of ordinary skill and common sense. KSR,
127 S.Ct. at 1742. So too, [g]ranting patent protection
to advances that would occur in the ordinary

course without real innovation retards progress. Id.
at 1741. In other cases, though, researchers can
only vary all parameters or try each of numerous
possible choices until *997 one possibly arrive[s] at
a successful result, where the prior art [gives] either
no indication of which parameters [are] critical or
no direction as to which of many possible choices is
likely to be successful. In re O'Farrell, 853 F.2d
894, 903 (Fed.Cir.1988). In such cases, courts
should not succumb to hindsight claims of obviousness.
In re Kubin, 561 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2009).
Similarly, patents are not barred just because it was
obvious to explore a new technology or general
approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation,
where the prior art gave only general
guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention
or how to achieve it. In re O'Farrell, 853
F.2d at 903.
In this case, there is no credible evidence that
the structural modification was routine. The district
court found that the appellee's expert was evasive
on this topic, stating that the witness did not directly
respond to most questions posed to him about
whether it would be common for a chemist who develops
a pyridine compound to conceive of and
make [2-pyr EHDP, 3-pyr EHDP, and 4-pyr EHDP]
isomers. Procter & Gamble, 536 F.Supp.2d at 486.
But evidence of evasion is not necessarily evidence
that the testimony would otherwise have been favorable.
The only direct evidence that the structural
modification was routine was presented by an expert
witness that the district court judge discredited.
FN1
FN1. Appellant's expert testified that if
someone was aware that [2-pyr EHDP]
was safe and effective, they would imme
diately in terms of the drug discovery ef
fort, make the [3-pyr EHDP]. However,
the district court concluded that this wit
ness had no specialized experience in the
area of bisphosphonates aside from his
preparation to testify in the litigation.
Procter & Gamble, 536 F.Supp.2d at 480.
Additionally, the expert prepared his opinion
by reviewing drug profiles in the current
version of the Physician's Desk Reference
instead of drug profiles from the relevant
time, causing his opinions to be
marred by hindsight. Id. at 495.
Accordingly, we conclude that the district court
did not clearly err in finding that Teva had not established
a prima facie case of obviousness as to
the challenged claims of the '122 patent.
V. Unexpected Results
The district court found that, even if Teva
could establish a prima facie case of obviousness, P
& G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected
results to rebut such a showing. Such evidence
included test data showing that the claimed composition[
] possess[es] unexpectedly improved
properties or properties that the prior art does not
have. In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692-93
(Fed.Cir.1990). Because Teva did not establish a
prima facie case of obviousness, P & G need not
rely on this evidence to defend the '122 patent.
Nonetheless, we note that P & G's witnesses
consistently testified that the properties of risedronate
were not expected. For example, Dr. Benedict
testified that he and other researchers did not predict
the potency of risedronate. Ms. McOsker testified
that she was very surprised by the low dose
at which risedronate was effective. Dr. Miller stated
that the superior properties of risedronate were unexpected
and could not have been predicted. In a
test to determine the lowest dose at which these
compounds caused toxic reactions, risedronate outperformed
2-pyr EHDP by a substantial margin.
Risedronate showed no observable toxic effect at a
dose of 0.75 mg P/kg/day, while 2-pyr EHDP's no
observable effect level was only 0.25 mg P/
kg/day. In another test involving live animals, 2-pyr
EHDP was lethal at a dose of 1.0 mg P/kg/day
while risedronate was *998 not. Ultimately, the district
court weighed the evidence and evaluated the
credibility of the witnesses in concluding that P &
G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected

(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989)
results to rebut any finding of obviousness.
VI. Secondary Considerations of Non-
Obviousness
[21][22][23] Secondary considerations of non-
obviousness include the commercial success of the
invention at issue and its satisfaction of a long-felt
need. B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys.
Corp., 72 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996). The district
court found that secondary considerations supported
a finding of non-obviousness. When present,
such factors may often be the most probative and
cogent evidence [of non-obviousness] in the record.
Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d
1530, 1538 (Fed.Cir.1983).
The district court found that risedronate, marketed
as Actonel, has been an undisputed commercial
success and satisfied a long-felt unmet need.
FN2
This conclusion was based on the testimony of
Dr. Daniel C. Smith, who stated that risedronate experienced
favorable growth and had amassed $2.7
billion in aggregate domestic sales. The district
court based its finding of a long-felt unmet need on
the fact that, in the mid-1980s, osteoporosis was recognized
as a serious disease and existing treatments
were inadequate. However, because the competing
drug alendronate was available before risedronate,
Teva contends that risedronate could not
have satisfied any unmet need. Teva argues that the
long-felt need must be unmet at the time the invention
becomes available on the market, when it can
actually satisfy that need. To support this argument,
Teva cites Monarch Knitting Mach. Corp. v. Sulzer
Morat GmbH, 139 F.3d 877 (Fed.Cir.1998). In fact,
Monarch rejects a similar argument partly because
the competing inventions were not actually produced
until after the claimed invention's filing date.
Id. at 884. Here, alendronate was not produced until
ten years after the filing of the '122 patent. Under
Monarch, we look to the filing date of the challenged
invention to assess the presence of a long-
felt and unmet need. Accordingly, it was not clear
error for the district court to conclude that risedronate
met such a need and that secondary considera
tions supported a finding of non-obviousness.
FN2. The court rightly gave little weight to
risedronate's commercial success because
the prior art '406 patent was also assigned
to P & G. As of December 6, 1985, the filing
date of the '122 patent, 2-pyr EHDP
could be found only in a pending application
for the '406 patent, which was not
available to the public. See Merck & Co.,
Inc. v. Teva Pharma. USA, Inc., 395 F.3d
1364, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2005) (holding that
commercial success is not significantly
probative of non-obviousness where others
are barred from acting on the prior art).
VII. Whether the '406 Patent is Prior Art
[24] As an alternative to its position that risedronate
was not obvious, P & G argues that the '406
patent should not be considered prior art with respect
to the '122 patent because risedronate was
first synthesized by P & G before the '406 patent
was filed. At trial, Dr. Benedict, one of the inventors
named in the '122 patent, testified that he synthesized
risedronate in May 1985. P & G submitted
a portion of Dr. Benedict's laboratory notebook
which contains a May 3, 1985 entry detailing the
structure of risedronate and the procedure for its
synthesis, but this entry was unwitnessed and was
not corroborated by any other evidence.
*999 [25] It is well established that when a
party seeks to prove conception via the oral testimony
of a putative inventor, the party must proffer
evidence corroborating that testimony. Shu-Hui
Chen v. Bouchard, 347 F.3d 1299, 1309
(Fed.Cir.2003). The inventor must provide independent
corroborating evidence in addition to his
own statements and documents. Hahn v. Wong,
892 F.2d 1028, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1989). Because P &
G did not provide adequate corroborating evidence
of an earlier invention date for risedronate, the district
court correctly concluded that the '406 patent
qualifies as prior art for purposes of this inquiry.
VIII. Obviousness-Type Double Patenting
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 13
566 F.3d 989, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1947
(Cite as: 566 F.3d 989)
[26][27][28] In addition to its obviousness defense,
Teva also asserted that the '122 patent was
invalid for double patenting. The double patenting
doctrine is designed to prevent a patent owner from
extending his exclusive rights to an invention
through claims in a later-filed patent that are not
patentably distinct from claims in the earlier filed
patent. Geneva Pharm., Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline
PLC, 349 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2003) In general,
the obviousness analysis applies to double patenting,
except for three distinctions. First, statutory
obviousness compares claimed subject matter to the
prior art, while non-statutory double patenting compares
claims in an earlier patent to claims in a later
patent or application. Id. at 1377 n. 1. Second,
double patenting does not require inquiry into a
motivation to modify the prior art. Id. Finally,
double patenting does not require inquiry into objective
criteria suggesting non-obviousness. Id.
Having concluded that risedronate was not obvious
under 35 U.S.C.  103, we similarly conclude
that the '122 patent is not invalid for obviousness-
type double patenting. Additionally, we agree with
the district court that the claims of the '122 patent
are distinct from the claims of the '406 patent.
Comparing the claims of the '122 patent to those of
the '406 patent, we note that, while claims 4 and 16
of the '122 patent explicitly claim the risedronate
compound, the '406 patent claims an intermittent
dosing regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis
and claims no new compounds. Accordingly, Teva
failed to present clear and convincing evidence of
overlap between the claims of the two patents to invalidate
the '122 patent based on obviousness-type
double patenting.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.

RADER, Circuit Judge.
The United States District Court for the District
of Columbia held that later developments in the art
may inform the patentably distinct determination
for double patenting. Double patenting doctrines
and case law permit this court to agree in part, but
only to the extent that the subsequent developments
predate the secondary application that triggers a
double patenting rejection. Because genuine issues
of fact cloud the date of availability of materially
distinct processes, as well as the viability of those
processes, this court vacates and remands.
I.
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Takeda)
filed a patent application disclosing certain cephem
compounds and the process for making those compounds
in Japan on December 19, 1974. Takeda
filed later applications in the United Kingdom on
June 9, 1975, and in the United States on December
19, 1975. Takeda developed these new cephem
compounds through an acylation process, introducing
a new acyl group (RC=O) to an amino group
(-NR).
3
Takeda obtained a number of patents claiming
these cephem compounds through a series of continuations,
continuations-in-part, and divisional applications,
including *1374 the compound patents
that issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,098,888 (the '888
product patent) (application filed Dec. 19, 1975)
and its divisional, U.S. Patent No. 4,298,606 (the
'606 product patent) (application filed Aug. 28,
1979). This court refers to the December 19, 1975
application as the primary application. Takeda
filed these applications before June 8, 1995, making
them subject to the seventeen year patent term regime.
See 35 U.S.C.  154(c). In other words, the
patent terms on these inventions began on their
grant date, not on their filing date.
On January 8, 1990, Takeda filed its secondary
application covering the process for making the
cephem compounds claimed in the '888 and '606
product patents-sixteen years after the 1974 priority
date, and more than fourteen years after the filing
of the '888 product patent application. The process
patent issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,583,216 (the '216
process patent) on December 10, 1996, claiming the
sole process known and disclosed in the Japanese

priority patent application. The '216 process patent
led to the double patenting issue in this appeal.
In 1998, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) received two anonymous requests
for reexamination of the '216 process patent.
These requests asserted that the '216 process patent
was invalid for obviousness-type double patenting
in view of Takeda's prior patents, as well as
other prior art. During reexamination, Takeda relied
upon the declaration of Dr. Wuest disclosing an alternative
process (displacement process) for making
the cephem compounds claimed in the '216 patent.
Not persuaded by the Wuest declaration, the examiner
rejected the '216 process patent claims as patentably
indistinct over the '606 product patent
claims. Takeda appealed the rejection to the Board
of Patent Appeals and Interferences (the Board).
The Board dismissed Dr. Wuest's declaration as
speculative and upheld the examiner's double patenting
rejection.
Takeda challenged the Board's decision in the
District Court for the District of Columbia under 35
U.S.C.  145. Before the district court, Takeda
presented new evidence in the form of a declaration
of Dr. Duggan. In her declaration, Dr. Duggan explained
that the process disclosed in U.S. Patent
Nos. 6,552,186 (the Gerlach patent, published on
Sept. 12, 2002, issued Apr. 22, 2003) and 7,071,329
(the Monguzzi patent, published June 2, 2005, issued
July 4, 2006) provides a viable alternative,
non-infringing process for making the certain cephem
compounds claimed in the '606 product patent.
For purposes of cross-motions for summary
judgment, the parties stipulated that Method B of
the Duggan declaration described a materially distinct
alternative process. Therefore, before the district
court, the parties disputed whether the alternative
process-Method B, developed after the date of
invention-could defeat the double patenting rejection.
The district court concluded that subsequent
developments in the art [are relevant to] determin
ing whether alternative processes exist when
weighing patentable distinctions for double patenting.
Takeda Pharm. Co. v. Dudas, 511 F.Supp.2d
81, 91 (D.D.C.2007). Relying on Dr. Duggan's disclosure
of Method B (published in the Gerlach and
Monguzi patents in 2002 and 2005, respectively)
the district court found that the product and process
are patentably distinct and overturned the double
patenting rejection. Id. at 92. The district court
therefore granted Takeda's motion for summary
judgment that it was entitled to a reexamination
certificate, confirming its right to the '216 patent.
At the same time, the court denied the PTO's motion
for summary judgment. The PTO *1375 timely
filed a notice of appeal with this court.

double patenting takes two forms: statutory and
non-statutory. Id. Statutory, or same invention,

grant of a patent for any new and useful invention.
35 U.S.C.  101; Perricone, 432 F.3d at
1372-73. Non-statutory, or obviousness-type,
double patenting is a judicially created doctrine designed
to foreclose claims in separate applications
or patents that do not recite the same invention,
but nonetheless claim inventions so alike that granting
both exclusive rights would effectively extend
the life of patent protection. Perricone, 432 F.3d
at 1373.
[7] In other words, the double patenting doctrine
is designed to prevent unjustified timewise
extension of the right to exclude. In re Van
Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 943-44 (CCPA 1982). For
instance, the doctrine bars an applicant from obtaining
separate patents with separate terms for both a
product and process for making that product, unless
the product and process are patentably distinct.
See In re Taylor, 53 C.C.P.A. 1187, 360 F.2d 232,
234 (1966); In re Cady, 22 C.C.P.A. 1190, 77 F.2d
106, 109 (1935) (instructing that double patenting
is not sustainable when the product can be fabricated
by processes other than that secured by the issued
process patent) (quotation marks omitted).
The PTO's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure
(MPEP) explains that a product and its process are
patentably distinct if the product as claimed can be
made by another materially different process.
MPEP  806.05.
The parties agree that product and process
claims are patentably distinct if multiple processes
for creating a product exist at the time of the invention.
See, e.g., In re Cady, 77 F.2d at 109 (finding
that the process of manufacturing roofing material
was patentably distinct from roofing composition
when appellant's product as defined in the appealed
claims may be produced by processes other
than the processes patented).
The novel legal question in this case asks if
later-developed alternative processes are relevant in
the product-process patentably distinct inquiry.
The PTO contends that the date of invention, in this
case December 19, 1974, governs the relevance of
products and processes in the double patenting context.
Thus, the PTO submits that the date of invention
governs the timing of double patenting analyses
*1376 because other issues relating to patentability
are judged from the date of invention. For
example, the patentability requirements set forth in
112, 102, and 103 are judged as of the date of
invention or filing. See 35 U.S.C.  112, 102, 103.
The PTO does not cite statutory or case support for
the date of invention approach other than analogizing
to these other patentability requirements. In
the alternative, the PTO posits that alternative processes
must at least appear before issuance of the
primary patent application.
Takeda, on the other hand, argues that the
PTO's approach is too limited. In its view, processes
developed after the date of invention deserve
a role in the double patenting calculus. Acknowledging
that this court has not directly addressed
this legal question before, Takeda relies on a district
court case for the proposition that a court can
look to processes developed after the date of invention
for product-process double patenting situations.
See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. U.S. Steel
Corp., 604 F.Supp. 555 (D.Del.1985) (Phillips ).
In Phillips, the district court considered a process
developed in 1954, one year after the date of
invention. Id. at 567. In a footnote, the district court
noted that courts have considered developments in
the art arising after the date of invention when
resolving double patenting issues. In those cases,
however, the parties did not object to the court's
consideration of post-date inventive developments.
Id. at 568. The district court further noted the
Board's discussion in Ex Parte Hogan, No. 436-63,
(Pat. & Tr. Office Bd.App. Mar. 30, 1981), a nonprecedential
case from the Board of Patent Appeals.
In Ex Parte Hogan, the Board considered a later-
disclosed process in a double patenting challenge.
See slip op. at 5. Agreeing that later-developed processes
are relevant to the patentably distinct inquiry,

double patenting analysis with blinders so as to

avoid recognition or discourage disclosure of advances
in process technology as a means of making
a product patent. Phillips, 604 F.Supp. at 568.
This court affirmed Phillips on appeal. U.S. Steel
Corp. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 865 F.2d 1247
(Fed.Cir.1989) (Phillips II ).
In this case, Takeda argues that this court's affirmance
of Phillips rejected the PTO's exact date
of invention position. But on closer look, the only
mention of double patenting in Phillips II is in the
penultimate paragraph:
III. Remaining Arguments
We have carefully considered defendants' arguments
regarding: (1) double patenting .... We find
none persuasive of error in the district court's disposition
of any of those issues and none of sufficient
import to require discussion here of that disposition.
IV. Conclusion
The judgment of the district court is affirmed in
all respects.
Id. at 1253 (emphasis added). While Phillips II
affirmed Phillips in all respects, this court did
not address the double patenting argument. Thus,
Phillips II did not present a rule or reasoning that
decides the case before this court in this appeal.
See Nat'l Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. Am.
Cinema Editors, Inc., 937 F.2d 1572, 1581
(Fed.Cir.1991) (When an issue ... is ignored in a
decision, such decision is not precedent to be followed
in a subsequent case in which the issue
arises.).
The PTO argues that here, the product and process
were not patentably distinct as of the date of
invention, so the double patenting doctrine should
bar consideration of later-filed process claims.
However, adopting the PTO's approach of the date
of invention is only appealing at *1377 first
glance. It appears to provide a bright-line test that
conforms to the perspective used in other patentability
determinations. But as Takeda points out in its
brief, the date of invention raises other substant
ive questions such as: is the filing date the presumptive
date of invention? If so, what is the date
of invention, the domestic or foreign filing date? If
foreign, must a claim have been perfected under
119(e) with the filing of a certified copy of the
original foreign application and an English language
translation? What if the priority application
contains support for some but not all of the patent
claims? Would some of the claims be judged as of
different cutoff dates? What if the inventor swears
behind a reference?
In contrast, the district court's doing away
with blinders approach allows an applicant to
come forward with any evidence that its product
and process are patentably distinct, even if the alternative
process is developed decades after the filing
dates of the product and process applications.
The approach provides the patentee with the best of
both worlds: the applicant can use the filing date as
a shield, enjoying the earlier priority date in order
to avoid prior art, and rely on later-developed alternative
processes as a sword to defeat double patenting
challenges. Here, the primary application,
directed to certain cephem compounds, was filed in
the United States on December 19, 1975. The secondary
application, directed to the process for making
these cephem compounds, was filed in 1990.
Yet the district court relied on patent applications
published several decades later to show a patentable
distinction between the product and process.
[8][9][10] This court is not persuaded by either
approach. Neither approach addresses the policies
underlying the double patenting doctrine. The secondary
application (in this case, the process application
of January 8, 1990) actually triggers the potential
of an unjustified extension of patent term.
When filing the secondary application, the applicant
essentially avers that the product and process
are patentably distinct. Thus, the relevant time
frame for determining whether a product and process
are patentably distinct should be at the filing
date of the secondary application. In this case,
Takeda filed the '216 process patent application on
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

561 F.3d 1372, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1496
(Cite as: 561 F.3d 1372)
January 8, 1990. This approach allows an applicant
to rely on some later-developed methods to show
that the product and process are patentably distinct,
even though the alternative processes for
making that product may not have been known at
the filing date of the primary application. This rule
gives the applicant the benefit of future developments
in the art. At the same time, however, it prevents
the inequitable situation that arises when an
applicant attempts to rely on developments occurring
decades after the filing date of the secondary
FN1
application.
FN1. The dissent's hypothetical is a
stretch. It assumes nineteen years of copendency.
Today, patent terms are
triggered by the filing date, not the grant
date. In other words, both the product and
process patents will expire around the
same time (although there may be slight
variance due to patent term adjustment).
As such, an applicant is less likely to maintain
co-pendency for nineteen years.
Moreover, this court's prosecution laches
doctrine may render a patent unenforceable
when it has issued only after an unreasonable
and unexplained delay in prosecution.
Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Lemelson
Med., Educ. & Research Found., 422 F.3d
1378, 1384-85 (Fed.Cir.2005).
This approach should encourage the swift development
of materially distinct, alternative processes.
It is also consistent with the district court's
opinion in Phillips, 604 F.Supp. at 567 (considering
an alternative process developed one year after the
filing date of the primary application, and *1378
prior to the filing of the secondary application).
[11] Therefore, in this case, the applicant can
rely on subsequent developments in the art up to
January 8, 1990, the filing date of the secondary application,
in order to show a patentable distinction
between the cephem compounds claimed in the '606
product patent and the process for making those
compounds claimed in the '216 process patent. In
that regard, Takeda indicates that it disclosed an
unclaimed process (which it terms the
Displacement Process or the Unelected Method)
in the '888 product patent application. The
PTO, however, has continually dispute[d] the viability
of the ... [D]isplacement [P]rocess. Additionally,
Takeda asserts that Method B, disclosed in
the Gerlach and Monguzzi patents and described in
the Duggan Declaration, was disclosed as early as
1979. On this point, the PTO states that it di[d] not
dispute the technical merits of Dr. Duggan's declaration
only for purposes of cross-motions for summary
judgment. Further, the PTO stated in its motion
for summary judgment that [t]he only
alternative processes that Takeda (through Dr.
Duggan's declaration) has identified to this Court
are the processes described in ... the Gerlach patent[
] and in ... the Monguzzi patent[ ]. Today,
this court holds that the district court may not rely
on the Gerlach and Monguzzi patents. But questions
of material fact remain as to (1) the viability
of the Displacement Process, and (2) the disclosure
date of Method B. On remand, the district court
should determine whether these processes were disclosed
before January 8, 1990, the date of filing of
the '216 process patent.
III.
Because genuine issues of material fact exist
with respect to whether the cephem compound and
later-developed processes are patentably distinct,
this court vacates and remands for further factual
development.
VACATED AND REMANDED.

Each party shall bear its own costs.
SCHALL, Circuit Judge, concurring-in-part and

I agree with the majority that, in arguing
against the claim of obviousness-type double patenting
in the reexamination proceeding, Takeda
should not be able to rely on the disclosures of the
Gerlach and Monguzzi patents. However, I respect

fully part company with the majority in its conclusion
that Takeda should be able to rely on developments
in the art up to January 8, 1990, the date of
the filing of the '216 process patent application. In
my view, in arguing against the claim of obvious-
ness-type double patenting, Takeda should not be
able to rely on disclosures after the December 19,
FN1
1974 invention date. I believe that tying the inquiry
to the invention date is most commensurate
with patent law as a whole and the policy goals relating
to obviousness-type double patenting.
FN1. The PTO and Takeda used this date
as the presumed date of invention in
briefing and argument, so I will use it here
as well.
First, it seems to me that the date of invention
is most appropriate because it comports with current
patentability doctrines, and, as I explain later, I
view product-process obviousness-type double patenting
as a patentability doctrine. See, e.g., 35
U.S.C.  102(a) (A person shall be entitled to a
patent unless ... the invention was known or used
by others in this *1379 country, or patented or described
in a printed publication in this or a foreign
country, before the invention thereof by the applicant
for patent.  (emphasis added)); 35 U.S.C.
102(e) (A person shall be entitled to a patent unless
... the invention was described in (1) an application
for patent, published under section 122(b), by
another filed in the United States before the invention
by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent granted
on an application for patent by another filed in
the United States before the invention by the applicant
for patent .... (emphases added)); Apotex Corp.
v. Merck & Co., 507 F.3d 1357, 1359
(Fed.Cir.2007) ( 35 U.S.C.  102(g) provides that
an applicant is not entitled to a patent if  before
such person's invention thereof, the invention was
made in this country by another, who had not abandoned,
suppressed, or concealed it.  (quoting 35
U.S.C.  102(g)) (emphasis added)); In re Translogic
Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1259 (Fed.Cir.2007)
(An invention is unpatentable as obvious if the dif
ferences between the patented subject matter and
the prior art would have been obvious at the time of
invention to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
(emphasis added)); cf. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415
F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc) (We
have made clear ... that the ordinary and customary
meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the
term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the
art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as
of the effective filing date of the patent application.
(emphasis added)); Plant Genetic Sys., N.V.
v. DeKalb Genetics Corp., 315 F.3d 1335, 1339
(Fed.Cir.2003) (Enablement is determined as of
the effective filing date of the patent.  (emphasis
added)).
Second, we have previously emphasized the invention
date with respect to obviousness-type
double patenting:
The public should ... be able to act on the assumption
that upon the expiration of the patent it
will be free to use not only the invention claimed
in the patent but also modifications or variants
which would have been obvious to those of ordinary
skill in the art at the time the invention
was made, taking into account the skill of the art
and prior art other than the invention claimed in
the issued patent.
In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 893 (Fed.Cir.1985)
(emphases from original omitted, emphasis added).
Pertinent to this case, I view product-process obviousness-
type double patenting as a patentability
doctrine. At the date of invention, if only one process
exists to make the product, the two are
substantially co-extensive. See PTO's Br. 17. To
allow two patents to issue at that time would essentially
run afoul of 35 U.S.C.  101, as the applicant
would be receiving two patents on one invention.

See, e.g., In re Vogel, 57 C.C.P.A. 920, 422

cess double patenting doctrine back to its
101 origins serves to bolster the connection
between the doctrine and other questions
of patentability.
In a difficult case, the majority settles upon
what I would characterize as a not-unreasonable attempt
at compromise. Rejecting the approaches of
both Takeda and the government, it holds that the
relevant time frame for determining whether a
product and process are patentably distinct should
be at the filing date of the ['216 process patent application].
It thus concludes, in the setting of a
pre-1995 filing, that art developed after a product/
process invention date, but before a subsequent process
patent application filing*1380 date, can render
a previously unpatentable process patentable.
Through its approach, the majority concludes it is
preventing the patentee from having the best of
both worlds, whereby the applicant can use the filing
date as a shield, enjoying the earlier priority
date in order to avoid prior art, and rely on later-
developed alternative processes as a sword to defeat
double patenting. Maj. op. at 1376-77. However,
while the majority's approach is more restrictive
than that urged by Takeda, it still allows Takeda to
exclude sixteen years of prior art for invalidity purposes
(such as 35 U.S.C.  102, 103), while simultaneously
taking advantage of that art to overcome
a double-patenting rejection. This is what troubles
me about the majority's understandable desire to
find a middle ground in this case. It allows Takeda
to have it both ways. In addition, as far as I can tell,
there is no other doctrine or rule that allows unpatentable
material to spring back into patentability
based on later developments in the field.
As correctly stated by the majority,  [t]he
fundamental reason for the rule [of obviousness-
type double patenting] is to prevent unjustified
timewise extension of the right to exclude granted
by a patent no matter how the extension is brought
about.  Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251
F.3d 955, 967-68 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting In re Van
Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 943-44 (CCPA 1982))
(alterations in original). The majority's approach, it
seems to me, allows for such an extension. The
product and the unpatentable process should both
have entered into the public domain in 1998, when
the '606 patent expired. At that point, members of
the public should have been able to make the cephem
compounds without paying royalties to Takeda
or to another company. However, Takeda's rights in
the '216 process patent will not expire until
2013-almost forty years after its process was first
disclosed. In my view, this is an unjustified time-
wise extension of the right to exclude. Although
the cephem compounds are in the public domain,
no currently unpatented method exists for making
them.
I am also concerned that the majority's approach
could, in certain cases, result in the upsetting
of reasonable expectations as to what is in the
public domain. For example, let us assume we are
in the seventeen-year regime, as we are in this case.
Takeda is granted a product patent in year one. At
that time, only one process exists (Process A). That
process is disclosed, but not claimed, in the patent.
In year eighteen, the product patent expires, putting
Process A fully into the public domain. In addition,
during the seventeen-year patent term, no other process
has been developed, and thus Process A remains
unpatentable separately because it is coextensive
with the product patent. See In re Taylor, 53
C.C.P.A. 1187, 360 F.2d 232, 234 (1966); In re
Cady, 22 C.C.P.A. 1190, 77 F.2d 106, 109 (1935)
([D]ouble patenting is not sustainable when the
product can be fabricated by processes other than
that secured by the issued process patent.). Then,
in year nineteen, a second process, called Process
B, is invented for making the patented product. The
initial inventor then files a patent application on
Process A (assume proper co-pendency with the
product patent), triggering double-patenting concerns.
According to the majority's approach, this
second process would cause Process A to become
patentable, despite the fact that Process A and the
resulting product were in the public domain for one
year. It seems to me such a result runs counter to
2011 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.

public expectation and patent law's public notice
function.
Finally, the majority sets forth various questions
which it says counsel toward its approach:
[A]dopting the PTO's approach of the date of invention
is only appealing at *1381 first glance.
It appears to provide a bright-line test that conforms
to the perspective used in other patentability
determinations. But as Takeda points out in its
brief, the date of invention raises other substantive
questions such as: is the filing date the
presumptive date of invention? If so, what is
the date of invention, the domestic or foreign filing
date? If foreign, must a claim have been
perfected under  119(e) with the filing of a
certified copy of the original foreign application
and an English language translation? What if the
priority application contains support for some but
not all of the patent claims? Would some of the
claims be judged as of different cutoff dates?
What if the inventor swears behind a reference?
Maj. op. at 1376-77.
I do not share the majority's concern. I think
we must keep in mind these kinds of questions are
faced regularly and have been manageable. For example,
interference proceedings provide a parallel
to double-patenting: a court (or the Board of Patent
Appeals and Interferences) must look to the date of
invention while evaluating two competing applications.
That additional questions may have to be addressed
if the approach urged by the government is
adopted does not mean that we should ignore that
approach if we feel it is correct.
It may be that the new patent term will cure
many of the concerns enumerated in this opinion.
However, that does not mean that we should ignore
those concerns. Obviousness-type double patenting
is a judicially created doctrine, and using the date
of invention best comports with our previously
stated policy goals underlying the doctrine. For the
foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the
majority's decision allowing Takeda to use developments
in the art that post-date the date of invention
in arguing against the obviousness-type double patenting
rejection.
