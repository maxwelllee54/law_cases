DBC, LLC (DBC) appeals from a final decision
of the United States Patent and Trademark
Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
(the Board), which affirmed the examiner's rejection
of all pending claims as obvious under 35
U.S.C.  103. Ex parte DBC, No.2007-1907, 2007
WL 2433106 (B.P.A.I. Aug. 24, 2007) ( Decision
). Because substantial evidence supports the
Board's determination that the claims would have
been obvious, and because DBC has waived challenging
the appointment of the administrative patent
judges who presided over its appeal, we affirm.
I. BACKGROUND
This case involves juice made from the fruit of
the mangosteen tree (known scientifically as the
Garcinia mangostana L. *1376 tree), an exotic
plant thought to originate from Southeast Asia. The
mangosteen fruit, which is botanically unrelated to
the mango, is reputed to be one of the best tasting
of all tropical fruits. U.S. Patent No. 6,730,333
(the '333 patent), col. 1, ll. 22-23. The '333 patent
states that the pericarp or rind of the mangosteen
fruit-although very bitter-is known in folk medicine
to treat conditions such as intestinal and skin ailments.
Id., col. 1, ll. 33-34, 48-53. As a result of its
use in folk medicine, the medicinal properties of
the mangosteen tree have been studied in numerous
pharmacological and clinical studies. Id., col. 1, l.
58-col. 2, l. 18. According to the patent, these studies
have isolated in the mangosteen tree and its fruit
chemical constituents known as xanthones, biologically
active compounds that are receiving increased
attention as potentially able to provide a
variety of health benefits. Id.
DBC is the owner of the '333 patent, which issued
on May 4, 2004. The patent is directed to a
nutraceutical composition[ ] comprising a mixture
of the pulp and pericarp of the mangosteen fruit.
Id., col. 1, ll. 11-13. A nutraceutical is defined in
the patent as any compound[ ] or chemical[ ] that
can provide dietary or health benefits when consumed
by humans or animals. Id., col. 3, ll. 59-61.
Claim 1 is representative of the invention:
1. A nutraceutical beverage comprising:
pericarp from fruit of a Garcinia mangostana
L. tree; a first juice from fruit of a Garcinia
mangostana L. tree; and at least one second
juice selected from the group consisting of fruit
juice and vegetable juice.
On October 14, 2004, the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (PTO) granted a third
party's request for ex parte reexamination of the '
333 patent. During reexamination, the examiner rejected
all claims of the '333 patent as obvious over
a combination of seven prior art references: (1) Japanese
Patent 11043442 (JP '442); (2) Japanese
Patent 08208501 (JP '501); (3) James A. Duke &
Judith L. duCellier, CRC Handbook of Alternative
Cash Crops (1993) (Duke); (4) J.F. Caius, The
Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of India (1986);
(5) Keigo Nakatani et al., Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase
and Prostaglandin ESynthesis by
2
<<gamma>>-mangostin, a Xanthone Derivative in
Mangosteen, in c6 Rat Glioma Cells, 63 Biochemical

B.D. Basu, Indian Medicinal Plants (1999); and (7)
Othman Yaacob & H.D. Tindall, Mangosteen Cultivation
(1995) (Yaacob). Of these seven references,
JP '442 was the only reference not before the
original examiner who found the claims of the '333
patent application patentable.
In response to the examiner's rejection of the
claims during reexamination, DBC submitted three
declarations pursuant to 37 C.F.R.  1.132 to
provide objective evidence of nonobviousness.
These declarations attempted to demonstrate the
success of the commercial embodiment of the patented
invention, known commercially as XanGo
juice. The examiner was not persuaded by DBC's

evidence, however, and following a telephonic interview,
made the rejection final.
DBC appealed the examiner's final rejection to
the Board. The Board agreed with the examiner that
the seven prior art references in the record rendered
obvious all pending claims. The Board also concluded
that DBC's proffered evidence of commercial
success was not sufficient to overcome the
prima facie showing of obviousness. As a result,
the Board affirmed the examiner's rejection of the
pending claims as obvious under 35 U.S.C.  103.
*1377 DBC timely appealed. We have jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(4)(A).
II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
[1][2][3] A claimed invention is unpatentable if
the differences between it and the prior art are such
that the subject matter as a whole would have been
obvious at the time the invention was made to a
person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art. 35
U.S.C.  103(a); see also generally KSR Int'l Co. v.
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167
L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). The ultimate determination of
whether an invention would have been obvious is a
legal conclusion based on underlying findings of
fact. In re Dembiczak, 175 F.3d 994, 998
(Fed.Cir.1999), abrogated on other grounds by In
re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2000).
We review the Board's ultimate determination of
obviousness de novo. Id. We review the Board's underlying
factual findings for substantial evidence.
Gartside, 203 F.3d at 1316.
B. Analysis
DBC challenges the Board's decision on three
FN1
primary grounds.First, DBC contends that the
Board erred in finding a prima facie case of obviousness
based on a substantial new question of patentability.
Next, it contends that even if the Board
properly found a prima facie case of obviousness, it
erred by concluding that the submitted evidence of
commercial success was insufficient to rebut the
prima facie case. Finally, DBC argues that even if
the Board correctly affirmed the examiner's rejection
of the claims as obvious, its decision must nevertheless
be vacated because two members of the
panel that heard the appeal were unconstitutionally
appointed. We address each contention in turn, beginning
with DBC's challenge under the Appointments
Clause.
FN1. DBC also makes a number of arguments
related to its contention that various
aspects of the Board's decision qualify as
new grounds of rejection. We have considered
those arguments but find them unpersuasive.
We also observe that DBC
failed to request rehearing or reopening of
prosecution pursuant to 37 C.F.R.  41.77,
which it could have done had it believed
that the Board made a new ground of rejection
in affirming the examiner.
1. Appointments Clause
[4] DBC argues that regardless of the merits of
the underlying rejection, the decision of the Board
must be vacated because two of the administrative
patent judges on the panel were appointed unconstiFN2
tutionally.The government counters that DBC
waived this issue by failing to raise it either before
FN3
the Board or in its opening brief in this appeal.
We agree with the government that DBC waived
the issue by failing to raise it before the Board.
FN2. DBC first raised this argument in a
supplemental brief filed after briefing in
this case was completed.
FN3. The government contends, alternatively,
that Congress has already remedied
the problem by enacting legislation providing
a defense to a challenge to the appointment
of an administrative patent judge that
the administrative patent judge was acting
as a de facto officer. Because we conclude
that DBC has waived the argument,
we need not and do not address this contention.

545 F.3d 1373, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1123
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373)
In an article published in 2007, Professor John
F. Duffy of the George Washington University Law
School contended that legislation enacted in 2000
and delegating the power to appoint administrative
patent judges to the Director of the PTO (the Director)
instead of the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) was constitutionally infirm under the
Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art. II,  2, cl. 2.
See *1378 John F. Duffy, Are Administrative Patent
Judges Constitutional?, 2007 Patently-O Patent
L.J. 21, 21 (2007). Professor Duffy argued that the
Director may not constitutionally be delegated the
power to appoint administrative patent judges, who
are inferior Officers in the words of the Appointments
Clause, because the Appointments Clause
vests that authority only to the President alone, in
the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.
Id. at 21-25. DBC relies upon Professor
Duffy's theory here in arguing that because the administrative
patent judges were unconstitutionally
appointed, the Board's decision must be vacated. As
noted above, DBC did not raise its objection to the
manner of appointment to the Board itself. The
threshold question thus presented is whether its
failure to do so resulted in a waiver of the challenge.
[5] It is well-established that a party generally
may not challenge an agency decision on a basis
that was not presented to the agency. See Woodford
v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165
L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) ( As a general rule ... courts
should not topple over administrative decisions unless
the administrative body not only has erred, but
has erred against objection made at the time appropriate
under its practice.) (quoting United States v.
L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct.
67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952) (emphasis omitted)). In L.A.
Tucker, for example, the Interstate Commerce
Commission approved an application to extend a
motor carrier route. An examiner of the agency recommended
that the application be granted, and a
division of the Commission approved the recommendation.
L.A. Tucker, which had opposed the application,
requested, but was denied, reconsideration
by the full Commission. L.A. Tucker then petitioned
for further relief, which was also denied. It
then filed suit in district court challenging the
agency's grant of the application. Before the district
court, L.A. Tucker raised for the first time the argument
that the Commission's action was invalid because
the examiner had not been properly appointed
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. The
district court permitted L.A. Tucker to make the argument,
and invalidated the agency's action on that
basis.
The Supreme Court appeal raised the single
question whether such an objection, first made at
that stage of the proceedings, was not erroneously
entertained. L.A. Tucker, 344 U.S. at 35, 73 S.Ct.
67. Reversing the district court, the Supreme Court
found L.A. Tucker's objection untimely, characterizing
its challenge to the examiner's appointment as
clearly an afterthought, brought forward at the last
possible moment to undo the administrative proceedings
without consideration of the merits and
[which] can prevail only from technical compulsion
irrespective of considerations of practical justice.
Id. at 36, 73 S.Ct. 67. Finding the objection untimely,
the Court reasoned that orderly procedure
and good administration require that objections to
the proceedings of an administrative agency be
made while it has opportunity for correction in order
to raise issues reviewable by the courts. Id. at
37, 73 S.Ct. 67.
As the Supreme Court later explained in Wood-
ford, the requirement that a party object to an
agency prior to attacking that agency's action in
court serves two primary purposes. See Woodford,
548 U.S. at 89, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (discussing administrative
exhaustion vis-vis the Prison Litigation Reform
Act of 1995). First, it gives [the] agency an
opportunity to correct its own mistakes ... before it
is haled into federal court, and [thus] discourages
disregard of [the agency's] procedures. Id. at 89,
126 S.Ct. 2378 (last modification in original, internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). If

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373)
fore the Board, the Board would have had an opportunity
to consider and cure the alleged constitutional
infirmity. Under 35 U.S.C.  6(b), the Director
has authority to designate the members of Board
panels. The Director has delegated that authority to
the Chief Administrative Patent Judge. See Manual
of Patent Examining Procedure  1002.02(f) (8th
ed., rev.6, Sept. 2007), available at http:// www.
uspto. gov/ web/ offices/ pac/ mpep/ mpep_ e 8 r 5_
1000. pdf. According to the Board's standard operating
procedures, the Chief Administrative Patent
Judge will approve a revised designation of the
judges on any particular panel [w]hen satisfied
that there is good reason to change the panel
already designated. Board of Patent Appeals and
Interferences, Standard Operating Procedure 1
(Revision 12): Assignment of Judges to Merits Panels,
Motions Panels, and Expanded Panels at 6
(Aug. 10, 2005), available at http:// www. uspto.
gov/ go/ dcom/ bpai/ sop 1. pdf. As evidenced by
DBC's supplemental brief and its attachments, DBC
was able to determine, based on the appointment
dates of the administrative patent judges in question,
that they were appointed by the Director and
thus subject to an Appointments Clause challenge.
Thus, nothing prevented DBC from taking steps
while this case was before the Board to ascertain
the appointment status of the administrative patent
judges assigned to its case. Even if DBC did not
learn of the judges assigned to its panel until oral
argument or until a decision was issued, it still had
an opportunity to challenge the composition of the
panel in a post-argument submission or in a motion
for reconsideration. If DBC had timely raised this
issue before the Board, the Board could have evaluated
and corrected the alleged constitutional infirmity
by providing DBC with a panel of administrative
patent judges appointed by the Secretary. Of
course, the Board may not have corrected the problem,
or even acknowledged that the problem existed.
But in that case, DBC would have preserved its
right to appeal the issue.
The second purpose for requiring that a party
make an objection to the agency is that it promotes
judicial efficiency, as [c]laims generally can be resolved
much more quickly and economically in
proceedings before [the] agency than in litigation in
federal court. Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89, 126 S.Ct.
2378. The relief DBC seeks with respect to this
claim is for a properly appointed panel of administrative
patent judges to review the examiner's rejection
of its claims. If DBC had objected to the
Board, instead of to this court in the first instance,
it could have obtained relief immediately, and thus
avoided the unnecessary expenditure of the administrative
resources of the original Board panel, the
judicial resources of this court, and the substantial
delay and costs incurred in prosecuting this appeal.
[6] While the foregoing supports the conclusion
that DBC has waived challenging the appointments,
there is one final inquiry that nonetheless remains.
Because we retain discretion to reach issues
raised for the first time on appeal, we must consider
whether this is one of those exceptional cases that
warrants consideration of the Appointments Clause
issue despite its tardy presentation. See Golden
Bridge Tech., Inc. v. Nokia, Inc., 527 F.3d 1318,
1322-23 (Fed.Cir.2008) (While appellate courts
are given the discretion to decide when to deviate
from th[e] general rule of waiver, we have explained
that prudential considerations' articulated
by the Supreme Court counsel against hearing new
arguments for the first time on appeal absent limited
circumstances.) (internal citations omitted);
see also Golden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson
Co., 365 F.3d 1054, 1062 (Fed.Cir.2004).
*1380 The Supreme Court itself has, in rare
cases, exercised its discretion to review a constitutional
challenge not timely raised before the lower
tribunal. See, e.g., Freytag v. Comm'r, 501 U.S.
868, 879, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991);
see also Nguyen v. United States, 539 U.S. 69, 78,

Court has never indicated that such challenges must
be heard regardless of waiver. See Freytag, 501
U.S. at 893, 111 S.Ct. 2631 (Scalia, J., concurring
in part and concurring in the judgment) (observing
that the court did not create a general rule excusing
waiver). Rather, the Court has proceeded on a caseby-
case basis, determining whether the circumstances
of the particular case warrant excusing the
failure to timely object. See id., 501 U.S. at 879,
111 S.Ct. 2631 (We conclude that this is one of
those rare cases in which we should exercise our
discretion to hear petitioners' challenge to the constitutional
authority of the Special Trial Judge.).
DBC has recognized that our excusal of its waiver
is discretionary, see Oral Arg. at 2:20-2:22, available

mp 3/ 2008-1120. mp 3, but nevertheless urges us
to consider the merits of its Appointments Clause
challenge.
We decline DBC's invitation to consider a challenge
it failed to timely raise, as we do not view the
circumstances of this case to warrant such an exceptional
measure. Primarily, we reemphasize that
while this issue could have been raised before the
Board, it was not. Although DBC may not have appreciated
the argument until discovering Professor
FN4
Duffy's article,that article was not an intervening
change in law or facts, nor was it based on any
legal or factual propositions that were not knowable
to DBC when it was proceeding before the Board.
We are not persuaded to overlook DBC's lack of diligence
to present an issue of which it was, or
should have been, aware. To permit litigants like
DBC to raise such issues for the first time on appeal
would encourage what Justice Scalia has referred to
as sandbagging, i.e., suggesting or permitting, for
strategic reasons, that the trial court pursue a certain
course, and later-if the outcome is unfavorable-
claiming that the course followed was reversible error.
Freytag, 501 U.S. at 895, 111 S.Ct. 2631
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment).
FN4. Professor Duffy's article was pub
lished on July 23, 2007, over one month
before the Board issued the decision from
which DBC appeals (and over six months
prior to DBC filing its opening brief here).
Although we do not consider the article to
have any effect on DBC's obligation to
raise the issue, we note that even if it
somehow gave DBC a fresh opportunity to
present the objection, DBC failed to diligently
do so.
We also consider the remedial action taken by
Congress to weigh against considering the waived
challenge. On August 12, 2008, the President
signed into law legislation that redelegated the
power of appointment to the Secretary, thereby
eliminating the issue of unconstitutional appointments
going forward. Pub.L. No. 110-313,
1(a)(1)(B), 122 Stat. 3014, 3014 (2008) (codified at
35 U.S.C.  6(a)). The legislation also includes a
provision attempting retroactive correction of the
Director's appointments by providing a defense to
a challenge to the appointment of an administrative
patent judge on the basis of the judge's having been
originally appointed by the Director that the administrative
patent judge so appointed was acting as a
de facto officer. Pub.L. No. 110-313,  1(a)(1)(C),
122 Stat. 3014, 3014 (2008) (codified at 35 U.S.C.
6(d)). *1381 While we take no position on the
constitutionality of that defense, Congress's action
in fixing the problem prospectively means that our
decision will not affect cases decided by future panels
of the Board. This argues against our exercising
discretion to address the issue.
Finally, DBC has not made any allegation of
incompetence or other impropriety regarding the
administrative patent judges who heard its appeal,
nor has it alleged that these judges are somehow
unqualified to serve in the position. Indeed, the
Secretary, acting under the new statute, has reappointed
the administrative patent judges involved
in DBC's appeal. Thus, even if we were to exercise
our discretion to consider DBC's constitutional argument,
conclude that the judges were improperly

appointed, and remand to the Board for reconsideration
by a properly appointed panel, there is nothing
to suggest that the Board would do anything
other than simply (and legitimately) assign the case
to the same panel. The fact that we have affirmed
the merits of the Board's action in this case also
speaks against our exercising discretion and needlessly
protracting the reexamination of the present
patent.
We conclude that the circumstances presented
here do not warrant the exercise of our discretion to
hear DBC's Appointments Clause challenge.
2. Prima Facie Case of Obviousness
[7] A patent may not issue if the differences
between the subject matter sought to be patented
and the prior art are such that the subject matter as
a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary
skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
35 U.S.C.  103(a); see also generally KSR,
550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705. As
noted above, obviousness is a question of law based
on underlying facts. Dembiczak, 175 F.3d at 998.
The Board concluded that the prior art relied upon
by the examiner established a prima facie case of
obviousness:
Of record in the rejection is JP '442, which discusses
the known medicinal qualities of pericarp.
Of particular interest is Example 6, found on
page 16 of the translation, which describes a
drink which includes orange juice, water, and an
extract of pericarp.
JP '442 describes health benefits of its composition;
consequently it is a nutraceutical according
to the Appellant's definition in the Specification.
Example 6 of JP '443 [sic] includes pericarp from
fruit of a Garcinia mangostana L. tree in the
form of a medicinal extract. Example 6 also includes
orange juice, which is a juice selected
from the group consisting of fruit juice and vegetable
juice.
Thus, the only difference between the single
closest piece of prior art of record and instant
claim 1 is the addition of juice from fruit of a
Garcinia mangostana L. tree into the drink.
***
Duke describes that Garcinia Mangostana L. is
cultivated for its fruit, which has a flavor suggestive
of strawberry and grape; said to be the
most delicious of all tropical fruits. Yaacob describes
mangosteen fruits as one of the finest
flavored fruits in the world, outranking all other
tropical fruits; the mangosteen has therefore
justly earned the popular title of Queen of
Fruits.
We agree with the Examiner that these references
provide ample motivation to combine mangosteen
juice, another fruit or vegetable juice,
and mangosteen pericarp in a beverage, to cover
up the taste of the mangosteen rind.
*1382 Decision at 11-12 (internal citations
omitted).
On appeal, DBC primarily argues that the
Board failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness
based upon a substantial new question of
patentability because the JP '442 reference is cumu
FN5
lative and non-analogous art.DBC argues that
since JP '442 was the only new prior art reference
cited during reexamination, it cannot raise a substantial
new question of patentability. In In re
Hiniker Co., we suggested that a reference that
was not material to the question of obviousness ...
or ... was cumulative with any old art was not sufficient
to create a substantial new question of patentability.
150 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1998). Relying
on this passage, DBC contends that JP '442 is
not material to obviousness and is cumulative over
the prior art references that were before the examiner
during the original prosecution. We disagree
with DBC on both points.
FN5. DBC also argues that the Board's de

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373)
cision constitutes a new ground of rejection
because the Board cited the English
translation of JP ' 442, while only the English
translation of the abstract of that document
was before the examiner. We discern
no merit in this argument. As we discuss
infra, the Board's use of the example in the
translation goes no farther than, and
merely elaborates upon, what is taught by
the abstract.
The abstract of JP '442 describes a composition
designed to be resistant to legionella bacteria and
which includes one or more extracts from a number
of fruits and other biological products, one of
which is mangosteen rind. The examiner observed,
in his answer before the Board, that [i]f you want
to consume the rind, it was known in the prior art to
mix it with a fruit such as strawberry as taught by
JP '442 (abstract). J.A. at 3735; see also id. at
3735-36 (The key piece of art is JP '442 which
clearly teaches mangosteen rind and raspberry,
strawberry and/or blackberry in the same composition.).
The Board similarly concluded that the reference
teaches a legionella bacteria disinfection
agent and ingestible compositions, e.g., drinks, that
contain the disinfection agent. Decision at 5. Thus,
as both the examiner and the Board recognized, the
abstract teaches mixing the mangosteen rind in a
composition with fruits and fruit juices to obtain a
legionella resistant composition (a nutraceutical under
the '333 patent's definition of the word). Because
it teaches a nutraceutical beverage combining
fruits and fruit juices and mangosteen rind in the
same composition, JP '442 is plainly material to
patentability.
[8] DBC also contends that JP '442 is cumulative
over JP '501, which describes the reconstitution
of the [mangosteen] extract into a drug and
states that the drug can take any suitable form for
administration including as a syrup, solution, or
suspension with a carrier. Decision at 6. But, as is
plain from JP '501, that reference does not teach
that mangosteen rind (or extract) can be made into a
composition with fruits or fruit juices, only that it
can be made into a syrup, solution, or suspension
with a carrier. Because JP '442 is the only reference
that teaches that the mangosteen rind can be
combined with fruits and fruit juices to make a nutraceutical
composition, it is not cumulative with respect
to any of the prior art references that were before
the original examiner. We thus reject DBC's
argument that JP '442 does not raise a substantial
new question of patentability.
DBC does not appear to challenge the Board's
prima facie case of obviousness per se, only that it
was not based upon a substantial new question of
patentability. Because we have rejected that argument,
and because JP '442, together with the other
references cited, is substantial evidence*1383 fully
supporting the Board's finding of a prima facie case
of obviousness, we affirm that portion of the
Board's decision.
3. Secondary Considerations
[9] During reexamination, and in response to
the examiner's rejection of the pending claims,
DBC submitted three declarations pursuant to 37
C.F.R.  1.132 in an effort to demonstrate the commercial
success of XanGo juice. These declarations,
made by Kent Wood, Craig Johanson, and
Stephen Bean-officers and employees of XanGo,
LLC (XanGo), the exclusive licensee of DBC and
marketer of XanGo juice-described, among other
things, the ingredients in XanGo juice and the
process for making it. Those statements were
offered in an attempt to show that the juice is made
according to the claims of the ' 333 patent. The submitted
declarations also demonstrated that
XanGo juice enjoyed $130 million in gross sales
during the first two years it was on the market, and
that XanGo's advertising budget represented only a
small fraction of sales.
The Board was unpersuaded by DBC's evidence,
finding that it was insufficient to overcome
the strong prima facie case of obviousness. Decision
at 30. In particular, the Board found that:

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY Page 11
545 F.3d 1373, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1123
(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373)
The Appellants have not established with credible
and persuasive evidence what product was
marketed and when. The Appellants have not established
that the product which was sold is commensurate
in scope with the scope of the claims
for which protection is sought. Finally, the Appellants
have not persuaded us that the sales are a
result of anything other than network marketing,
the increasing popularity of mangosteen, and improved
availability of the mangosteen fruit in
general.
Accordingly, we find that the evidence of commercial
success is insufficient to persuade us of
the unobviousness of the claimed subject matter,
which differs from the prior art only in the addition
of a known, tasty, mangosteen juice.
Id. DBC makes several arguments to support
its contention that the Board erred in finding that its
evidence of commercial success did not overcome
the prima facie case of obviousness.
[10] First, DBC argues that the Board erred by
concluding that the evidence failed to show that
XanGo juice was commensurate with the claims.
On this point, we agree with DBC. The Board concluded
that the Bean declaration, which proffered
that XanGo juice was commensurate in scope
with the claims of the ' 333 patent, was not worthy
of credibility:
Mr. Bean's Declaration provides no persuasive
evidence of any real personal knowledge of the
contents of XanGo for the relevant time frame
for claimed commercial success. For example, no
chemical analyses, product batch sheets, manufacturing
records, sales records, or the like are
provided in support of any specific testimony that
the commercially sold XanGo product contains
the listed ingredients.... In sum, we do not find
paragraph 5 [listing the ingredients] to be persuasive
or credible.
Decision at 27. In his declaration, Bean avers
personal knowledge of the contents of XanGo
juice, based on discussions with employees, contractors,
and officers of DBC. J.A. at 343. Under
the circumstances of this case, no more is required
to demonstrate that the XanGo juice falls within
the scope of the claims, particularly when the
product label itself demonstrates as much.
[11] The Board also called Bean's credibility
into question because, when stating that XanGo
juice was commensurate with the claims, he did not
state that it also included a vegetable juice. Apparently,*
1384 the Board thought that the commercial
embodiment of the claim must contain both a fruit
juice and a vegetable juice since the claim recites
at least one second juice selected from the group
consisting of fruit juice and vegetable juice. On
this point, the Board also erred. DBC need not sell
every conceivable embodiment of the claims in order
to rely upon evidence of commercial success, so
long as what was sold was within the scope of the
claims. See Applied Materials, Inc. v. Adv. Semiconductor
Materials Am., Inc., 98 F.3d 1563, 1570
(Fed.Cir.1996) ([A] patentee need not show that
all possible embodiments within the claims were
successfully commercialized in order to rely on the
success in the marketplace of the embodiment that
was commercialized.).
Next, DBC argues that the Board erred when it
found no nexus between the claimed invention and
the submitted evidence of commercial success. Related
to this argument, DBC also claims the Board
erred when it suggested that the commercial success
of XanGo juice may be attributable to other
factors, such as aggressive network marketing. The
Board concluded that although $130 million in
sales in two years was a substantial figure, there
was no persuasive evidence tying those sales to
the claimed subject matter. Decision at 29. Elaborating
on this point, the Board observed that the
evidence in the record suggested that the success of
XanGo juice may be due to other factors-for example,
the increasing popularity of the mangosteen
fruit in general. Id. Based on this increasing popularity,
it observed that there was no evidence

(Cite as: 545 F.3d 1373)
comparing the growth in sales of XanGo to the
growth in sales of mangosteen juice in general. Id.
The Board also highlighted the marketing structure
of XanGo, which is a network marketing company
that pays substantial commissions for sales,
and noted that [h]ow much of the commercial success
is due to aggressive network marketing in the
form of sales commissions and bonuses is unexplained
by the Appellants. Id. at 30. In light of
these infirmities in DBC's submitted evidence, the
Board found it insufficient to upset the prima facie
case of obviousness.
The Board's conclusion is supported by substantial
evidence. We have held on a number of occasions
that evidence of commercial success alone
is not sufficient to demonstrate nonobviousness of a
claimed invention. Rather, the proponent must offer
proof that the sales were a direct result of the
unique characteristics of the claimed invention-as
opposed to other economic and commercial factors
unrelated to the quality of the patented subject matter.
In re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 140
(Fed.Cir.1996); see also In re GPAC Inc., 57 F.3d
1573, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1995) (For objective evidence
to be accorded substantial weight, its proponent
must establish a nexus between the evidence and
the merits of the claimed invention.). Here, DBC
has done little more than submit evidence of sales.
However substantial those sales, that evidence does
not reveal in any way that the driving force behind
those sales was the claimed combination of mangosteen
fruit, mangosteen rind extract, and fruit or
vegetable juice. Nor is there any evidence that sales
of XanGo juice were not merely attributable to
the increasing popularity of mangosteen fruit or the
effectiveness of the marketing efforts employed.
For the foregoing reasons, we cannot conclude that
the Board's decision is unsupported by substantial
evidence. We thus affirm that portion of the Board's
decision.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the
Board is
AFFIRMED.
